0,Can my parents/school force me to take heart medication?,"I'm 15 and a boy, I live in New York (state).

Several months ago I had a heart burn that was misinterpreted by doctors to be a ""heart attack"" (it wasn't, simply put, severe over exaggeration.) Since then I've been made to take ""medication"" at home, which I don't want to bc I've read about the side affects and I don't want to be taking something for an issue that doesn't exist.

Since I got it originally I just stopped taking the pills, which long story short my parents found out about and it has been a very big fight with them since. They have contacted my (public) school and after they had a talk with me and the principal basically what has been happening is I come in in the morning and they force me to go in a room with the guidance conseuler and an extra person and watch me swallow the pills that I ""need"". For some time I'd go and make myself vomit immediately after in the bathroom and they found out and now I have to stay for twenty minutes and drink water. They do not let me go to classes if I refuse.

How can this be legal? I'm sorry to ask here but I literally cannot find information on this anywhere. Where would I even report this if the principal is in on it?"
1,University expulsion due to cheating,"TL;DR: Cheated on two exams during my last semester of university by obtaining a professor's login information and seeing the exams before they were given. Professor gave me an F in the course but passed the information along to higher-ups, who subsequently expelled me. I will be appealing my case, I have a few more days to send in an appeal letter. After I send in my appeal I am entitled (based on the code of conduct) to a hearing in front of the dean. I have contacted an attorney who is looking at everything. I want to know what the best course of action is to make my chances as strong as possible in getting my sanctions lessened. Location is United States.

&#x200B;

The course I cheated in was NOT a major course. I completed all of my major courses by merit, and this is my first cheating offense. I have never been accused of misconduct or wrongdoing in my 4 years at this university.

First and foremost - I have reached out to an attorney who has recommended me a few things, but I wanted to come here as well for any and all advice. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

Backstory:

Sometime in February, I planted a camera behind the keyboard in the classroom where my professor lectured. Once she typed in her login information, I was able to view the video and obtain her login information to use for my own personal benefit. On dozens of occasions, I logged on using the professor’s login information on school computers in labs that have cameras, and viewed exams, past labs, and even changed my own grade in the course. The first exam, around late march, I had seen the answer key prior to taking the exam, and naturally got a 100% on the exam. No suspicion was raised by the professor. I continued to view answer keys prior to the next exam, which was taken in late april. My exams were very identical to the answer keys. I had noticed that the professor changed her password after the second exam when I went to login again, and so I put the camera back in the same place as the first time. However this time, at some point during the video it shows her looking directly at the camera, implying that she did indeed see it.  In the beginning of May about a week after the second exam, my professor came up to me after class and asked for me to come with her to the department chair’s office. When I sat down, the department chair told me that there was a strong suspicion of me cheating on exams 1 and 2, and asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them. I said “I admit, I cheated on them.” That is all I said. I did not admit to how I cheated. Afterwards, he asked me how I cheated, to which I did not respond. They had me sign a form essentially stating that I admitted to cheating and that they were going to pass along the information to the academic affairs committee for further investigation and potentially further sanctions on top of an F in the course. About a week later, a police officer from the university came to my apartment and asked me to come with him. He drove me to the campus police station, where I was questioned about “illegal computer usage.” An hour later, at the academic affairs office, I was informed verbally that I was going to be expelled from the university, and a day later, I received a letter reiterating the fact that I had been expelled. The letter says that I will not get a degree, can not participate in graduation, and can not be readmitted to the university, now or in the future.

&#x200B;

I reached out to an attorney yesterday, and will be meeting with him tomorrow.

&#x200B;

The steps I am taking for this:

&#x200B;

The university allows students to appeal the decision within 5 days of receiving the letter, which I am doing. Essentially the appeal that I have written states that I admit my actions were egregious, and that I felt so much pressure to pass the course and felt awful when I cheated even before I got caught. I said that I wanted to fess up but didn't know how, and that when I was confronted I did not at all try to justify my actions, hide them, or lie. I came clean completely, and the burden was finally off. In my appeal I am respectfully asking for my sanctions to be lessened to at most a suspension from the university so that I can still graduate, albeit not on time.

&#x200B;

I have not yet sent the letter, as I still have a few more days to submit the appeal, and I am waiting for my attorney to look at the letter tomorrow and give me any advice. The reason I got an attorney was so that I could either:

a) heavily grovel (an attorney cannot be present during the hearing) and the attorney would just help me before I go in

b) basically sue the school saying the sanctions are too harsh

&#x200B;

I will NOT be denying my actions. The school has sufficient proof that I used the professor's login credentials for my own benefit. I have to come clean, and just hope that the school shows mercy. If the appeal does not go well, I will resort to plan B, which is getting the attorney directly involved.

&#x200B;

Any advice on what I should say during the hearing, or anything else I should do?"
2,Do I have a free car?,"FROM: California, USA. 

So the small amount of background to this story is that, I recently (3 months ago) leased a new car. After three months of no bills, I checked in, and figured out the following had happened to the contract. 

When filing the contract with the auto dealer, Nissan kicked back the contract because of a very small error ($1.75 tax in Cali per tire, but they taxed a 5th, backup tire that my car doesn’t come with). They sent it back to the dealership to be fixed, but in that time, the dealership was sold to someone else. 

The lease was pretty much in limbo, with really being in no place at the time that it had been sold. Nissan didn’t have it, and the new company didn’t have it. 

Now, the new dealership is sending us a contract to be signed. Do we have any legal obligation to sign, or could we just go down to the DMV and remove them from the lease, since there’s no contractual evidence that gives them any ownership over the car?

It’s obvious that people think I’m trying to defend myself in my comments but what I’m really trying to do is offer more information. It’s obvious from the conversations I’ve had with the new dealership that they don’t have a legal claim to the car, and that’s what I’ve attempted to describe. Thanks for downvoting me for that."
3,Prank gone wrong (Michigan),"We were out on a school retreat this weekend. Everyone in this story is 18 if that's relevant. 

My buddy has long hair that he wanted to cut. He's been growing it out for a while and it's basically his signature. As a prank, we decided to come up behind him and cut his hair off and make everyone think he wasn't in on it.

He was wearing a blue flannel and so was a girl on the trip. I cut the wrog person's hair. I realized as soon as I closed the scissors, but a chunk of hair was gone right up to her scalp, probably about a foot and a half long.

She cried a lot, but when she parted her hair on the side you couldn't tell. She went to a fancy salon and got it fixed with extensions or something and apparently it cost like $200 even though you could barely see the difference when she parted her hair.

Today I heard from a lot of people at school that her parents made a police report and that she's going to sue me for almost $1k. Can they really do this!? How much trouble will I get in? I'd be willing to pay for her initial haircut (even though it apparently cost like $200 which seems outrageous) but I think she's being ridiculous. She looks fine and honestly she'd look cute if she just cut it all off anyway. Should I get a lawyer?"
4,Pronouns and compelled speech,"A University professor (a public university in North Carolina) has given a friend of mine a beginning -of-class survey that requests his preferred pronouns. It is the only required question on the survey. 

I’ve tried to talk him into just doing it so that he doesn’t lose recommendation letters etc. but he says that he doesn’t want to “be forced to tacitly endorse the metaphysical beliefs of the liberal upper class by participating in its rituals.”

We both agree that we have no idea what his rights are in this situation and I’m curious to know as well since it’s only a matter of time before I’m in a similar situation; so I looked to see if there’s a subreddit for this kind of thing—that brought us here. What are our rights?"
5,California. I've been experiencing work place bullying for a year. At multiple employers. I'm currently in contact with a laywer who specializes in hostile work environment but I may not be to prove that it was because I was a protected class. What else can I do?,"I keep getting bullied at work by competitive girls. These girls will start rumors about me so I will have no friends and no support from management. (If you want more specific details, feel free to ask in the comments. It will help me organize my thoughts) I was going to let it go but the stress from the situation has aged me about 10 years and has aggravated my depression and anxiety to the point where I may not be able to work again. My hands shake when I'm stressed and they never did before. Me and my husband are very stretched financially as a result. I have health problems that may be effecting my ability to have children and I can't go to the doctor for it because of the financial strain that this situation has caused. I can't seem to work anywhere without girls trying to get me to quit. I have social anxiety and this has been very damaging to me and management never helps. I just need whatever information you can give me about what my options are if I can't pursue a case for hostile work environment. I'm 33 and I shouldn't feel like I need to apply for disability."
6,Update: Help! The California State took everything!,"I have been asked to post an update on what happened, and how everything worked out.  Especially since [this redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/43w613/my_entire_savings_account_was_emptied_because_of/) could use the information.

All names have been changed to protect those involved.

Tl;Dr: Money Stolen by DCS, threatened to end two lawyers careers and file federal suit, everything is better now.

Recap:
When the story last left off, someone at Bank of America was able to help me get a provisional credit.  This was set to expire on the following Monday evening and I was to come into the bank first thing Monday morning.

I called out sick to work for Monday in advance warning on Saturday that I could not come in, and explained the situation to work.  They seemed bewildered that this was even possible and were completely understanding.

On Monday morning, I went into the branch and brought in EVERY form of ID that I had.   I had my Social Security card, with my name.  My passport, my birth certificate, my drivers license, and I happened to have a letter from the SS Administration stating that my SS # belongs to me (this was something a different bank at one time suggested I have on hand in case of identity theft).    All of the information was scanned into their system and we called Bank of America legal. I do not know who exactly because the person at the branch handled that side and could not disclose much.   The person in legal had access to the court order and was able to verify that the name on the letters did not match my account.  Only the SSN matched.  Given all of my proof of my identity they had no choice but to immediately put my money back at Bank of America's expense (even though it had already been turned over to the state) or face possible legal repercussions from the improper seizure of assets of the wrong account holder.  I was given an apology for the situation, but a recommendation that I work out the issues with the state.

So, I had all of my money back, by 5 PM that day.  Awesome!  They also helped me work out some other issues relating to my stocks, investments, and other stuff at the same time.  I had them not perform any other changes to my account at the time, but they were more than helpful in answering some other questions I had.

After this, I checked my other accounts and found all of the funds, stocks and other things I had with other companies had been released as they deemed the court orders to be defective.  (I didn't even need to call them for this to happen, it was amazing.)

I called the California Department of Child Services main line, and got the run-around again.  However, at this point everyone at that office had heard my story, just none of them could give me any information because it ""was not my case to be given information on.""  I did get some hints at the kinds of questions I needed answered though, so I hung up and called back.

""Hi, my name is Gloria I cannot seem to find what district my case is out of so that I can call them directly.  The case number is blahblahblah.""
Response: ""Ah yes, Gloria, what SSN do we have on file for your case so we can confirm your identity.""
""My SSN is 000-111-1234"" (insert actual SSN)
Response: ""Ah, thank you, yes, your case is out of our Los Angeles district, would you like me to transfer you?""
""Sure!""
 For the record, I am not Gloria nor do I sound like Gloria, but that was what they needed to hear and I could hear a slight chuckle on the other side because, at this point, they had to know who I was but we had to play the game.

Once transferred I listened COMPLETELY to the prompts.
X if your a parent/guardian
X if your so and so
Press option 3 if your a lawyer with...

Well, option 1 and 2 didn't work... lets press 3 and see what happens.
""Thank you for calling Department of Child Services, so and so speaking, how can I help you?""
""Ah, can you confirm I have been transferred to the Los Angeles district?""
""Yes sir, how can I help?""
""I needed to speak to the attorneys handling case number blahblahblah.""
""Are you a lawyer representing a party to the case?""
""In a round-about manner of speaking, yes.""
""ok, well, I regret to inform you that the attorney handling the case is out on vacation for the next few days, would you like me to transfer you to her supervisor?""
""That would be AMAZING, per chance, what is her supervisors name?""
""Her name is Julia Nicholson""
""Thank you so much.  I'll hold while you transfer me.""
---
""Hi this is Julia Nicholson, I hear you are calling about case blah blah blah, how can I help""
""Hi Julia, my name is Saphirabrightscales, in short, the Department of Child Services has stolen my identity and transposed it on this case.  Your department has illegally levied all of my assets without due process, violating my constitutional rights.  I want everything back.""
""... er, excuse me.?""
""Julia, I am pretty sure you heard me correctly.  But to repeat.... (repeated what I said above).""
""Well, we are not the department that handles disputes.. you will need to contact the disputes department at... XXX-xxx-XXXX""
""Julia, I have tried. But they report they will not release my funds for 30-45 days.  Given that I am not a party to this case and in no way involved, I do not find that acceptable for violating my constitutional rights.  Would you?""
""No, I suppose I wouldn't.""
""Great.  Then we are on the same page.  Just in case this has not already been made clear, your department **STOLE** my SSN and put it on someone else case, violating the Fourth and Fifth amendment in the process.   If, you cannot return my funds within 24 hours, then I will file a case in federal court for violation of civil rights and liberties and I will personally see to it that your attorney and yourself are disbarred for it as well.  Am I clear?""
""Yes sir.  Can I ask some questions?""
""Sure, go for it.""
""You are not Juan Garcia?""
""No I am not.""
""You are not Gloria?""
""I am sure you can tell that by my voice, but no I am not.""
""Right.  Are you a party to or have you ever been a party to a case with DCS?""
""No, and to be clear, I have only had sex with two people in my life.  Neither of whom have children, both of whom I have spoken to in the past day.  Also, I am likely unable to have children at all.""
""I see.  I am sorry to hear that. Well, um... looking through the records it appears a clerical error was made in inputting the SSN in some records.""
""Great.  So you can fix it quickly then.""
""Well, we need to speak with the judge and other attorneys and we need to figure out where the funds are, it may take some time.. we need at least a week to...""
""Ok.  Well, then I guess I will see you in Federal Court in Washington State after I file the case, you might want to pack some warmer clothing if you are not used to the weather.  I will let you know when I have details on your and your attorneys disbarment procedures..""
""Wait.  Um...  I have some other things to do at the courthouse today and will see to it that we get this process rolling.  I cannot do it all in 24 hours, but I can get it done in the next two days.  At least your money back.  It will take longer than that to get your SSN off of records.""
""Ok, well, 48 hours is reasonable and I will hold you to that.  I want to let you know, Bank of America legal is already involved in this process as well and is waiting to hear from your office.""
""Ok, I understand.  I will get your information over to our fraud department and get this going right now.  Expect to hear from someone within an hour.""
""Ok, I will call you back if I don't hear back in an hour.""
""I understand.  Again, I am sorry about all of this.""
""I appreciate your help.  We will be in touch.""

Shortly thereafter someone from DCS called me and asked me to email any documentation I have of my identity to them.  I gave them all I had.  They asked for a pay stub or bill showing my address and I gave that as well.  The person was more than kind about the whole thing, but it was very procedural. I was asked questions of ""have you ever worked at?, have you ever lived at?, do you know someone at?"" the answer was no to everything. He assured me they would be sending me letters and emails with documentation for me to prove that this was all cleared up, just in case something came up in records later.

The following morning at 8 AM SHARP (to the second) I got a call from Bank of America, head of a legal department that handles levy's.  It was an apology, they admitted that they should never have taken the funds from my account because the wrong name was on all of the paperwork.  It was a defective court order and should not have been followed but returned as such.  At the very least, they should have called me to confirm what was going on.  The apologized and informed me that they were initiating a review of their procedures to prevent this from ever happening in the future.  I informed them that I did not place all of the blame on them, someone at DCS made the first mistake.  I also thanked them for their help in resolving it quickly.  They also informed me that they had received a letter overnighted from DCS ordering them to release my funds immediately and confirmed that there was a clerical error on their end.

Over the next week I had to field more random calls from DCS of ""have you ever? Did you?"" again, all ""No"" but I was as polite as I could be about the whole thing.   After a week, complete silence.

Randomly on an (I think) Wednesday I received four overnighted letters from Bank of America.  ""We regret to inform you that we have received a court order from the State of California seizing all assets in the accounts listed below and in the amounts listed.""
Oh shit... I cannot believe... (as I continue reading)
""0.00 | Checking""
""0.00 | Savings""
""0.00 | Joint Savings""
""A service fee of 0.00 has been charged to each of the accounts for this service.  Thank you, Bank of America""

I must admit, I laughed.  The state had AGAIN attempted to levy everything, but Bank of America had denied it..  So, back to the phones, I called the attorneys cell phone and informed her what had happened through voicemail ""Hi this is Saphirabrightscales, if you recall all of my assets had been levied illegally, yeah.., well I got a letter from the bank today informing me that DCS had attempted this again. I need an immediate call back with an explanation.  If I *do not* get a call back by 5 PM tonight, I will file my federal case as soon as the courts open in the morning.""
I also called and left the same voicemail with the person handling the fraud part.

15-30 minutes later I get a call back from someone I had not worked with previously at the fraud department. ""Hi, Mr. Brightscales.  My name is Angela with the Department of Child Services.. I.. well, I have been handling your case.""
You could hear in her voice, she had just been yelled at by someone, and completely blown up on.  It was the voice of someone who was caught not doing their job and had definitely heard about it from her boss.
""Yes, so, what is going on?""
""Well your information has been removed from our records and the only thought I have is that it was just paperwork still working its way through our system.  I apologize.  Did you not get our letter stating that your name has been removed from our system?""
""No, I have received no letters from DCS ever.""
""Oh.  Well I sent it..  Could I get your address?  It seems I do not have it on file here.""   (How did she send it without it being on file?  Whatever...)
""Sure, it is blah blah at blah blah, Washington.  Can you email me a copy just in case?""
""Yes, I will have that out right now.  Sorry about the confusion.""

I had that letter in my email five minutes later, and in my mail box the next day.

So far, that has been it.  No other repercussions.   I lost a days pay dealing with it all (used sick time.) But honestly, while I can file with the state of California for reimbursement and try to make the case for that, it is not worth my time and I have decided to let it go. I am thankful at how quickly it was handled, but what it took to get it handled was a bit ridiculous.  I wish I could say that I came out ahead for it, but I am just happy to come out even. I hope I never have to threaten to ruin someones career, or file a federal lawsuit and mean it again.

I hope this helps someone else. :)

Edit:  Although I am loathe to respond to any of this.  I hate to say it, yes.  This is exactly how it went down.  I really, truly did not care to post it because it all seemed so outlandish to me that it happened at all and I knew that I would not be taken seriously.  Someone asked for an update, so I did.  I really do not care to prove myself, but I will leave an image of the letter I got. http://imgur.com/UgQmhoW

It all happened as said, lots of crying in-between but other than not including the tears I did my best to not embellish the story as some have a habit of doing.   Good luck, and my only hope is that this helps someone else."
7,We put an adopted dog to sleep after severe behavioral issues. The shelter is threatening legal action.,"Us: New Jersey
The Shelter: New York

**Backstory** Skip if you're not interested.

My partner and I have been waiting to be able to have the time and money to care for a dog for 3 years. Over the summer we were ready, and adopted a young mutt. This dog slowly developed severe behavioral issues.

The dog would steal and destroy any object in the house and snap at us if we attempted to stop them. The dog would jump, bite the leash and lunge anytime we saw *any* moving object outside. The dog progressively got less safe to be around. I personally took this dog to the park to run 3 hours everyday day without any noticeable effect. We felt unsafe managing this dog and turned to professional help. 

We got all the mental stimulation toys, went to classes by dog trainers for this type of behavior, and started working with a vet that specialized in behavior issues. We spent the next 2 months running through all of the medication and training tips that the vet provided and that we could find. We had a trainer come to our house. We found nothing that helped. The Vet said that the next steps would be trying medication that could take 6-12 months to dial in. We could not emotionally or financially afford that. We hated life and the dog hated life.

**Present Day**

So we made the decision to euthanize the dog. This was crushing as we had researching, prepping, and waiting for our first family dog for years and felt like failures. The Vet Behaviorist and the administering Vet agreed with our decision and we did it. I told the shelter after the fact. They were upset as it said in our adoption contract, that if for any reason we were unable to take care of the dog, we were to return them. It does say that. I don't want to talk about why we did not return the dog. 

Today we got a letter in the mail from what looks like a law firm. 80% of the letter is explaining to us how awful we are, with the last 20% asking for funds and demanding to know the contact information for the Vet to verify that we didn't just shoot the dog. They are asking for fees incurred from taking care of the dog. Food, boarding and training fees, and training gear. About $5k in total.

**Question:** How should we respond?

* Firstly, I will be emailing the lawyer from the contact that I found online. Initial googling comes back that they look real.
* My very not professional opinion that I have gleaned from lurking here is that they would be owed the value of the dog, not the funds that they put in to the dog. This dog was not a purebred show dog or a training police dog. It was a dog that knew several commands, but that's it.
* Lastly, I would like to run this by a lawyer so that we can have them respond. But what kind? Contract lawyer probably?

Any suggestions, advice, or background info about contract law and animals in NY is appreciated. Thank you."
8,"There's a tenant at my apartment complex that has been complaining to my complex. Today, he made up a heniois lie about my roomate and I...","So I live in a really luxurious apartment complex. I'm a web developer that makes good money. However, I grew up poor and ""trashy"" all my life, so I don't look like I belong here. And it seems like there is at least one tenant wanting me out of there.

So up until today, all of the complaints did have some merrit. I always made sure to take the criticism and not let it happen again. It's always just something small like noise complaints.

Well today I got a call from my apartment complex saying that someone said that my roomate had been leaving his dogs outside for hours on end  and also abuses his dogs.

This is a flat out lie.

The only thing that came even REMOTELY close to the truth was last night, my roommates Chihuahua got out and ran off. The second we go. Odd, my roomate, myself, and his girlfriend who was visiting at the time, all went out and looked for her and called for her for 30 minutes until we found her.

So no one was leaving a dog. And this was the first time it happened. It isn't uncommon for dogs to accidentally get out, and I don't see it a huge deal unless it happens frequently, or if you just let you dog roam and not give any effort in getting your dog back on the leash or inside.

They said that animal control has launched an investigation. And ""tenants have been talking and are really concerned.""

My question is, what is my rights in Tennessee? I have never paid rent late not once.

Whats the likelihood of losing my place to live over an accusation from a tenant that seems to have an out for me? I don't know who I. May be or even why. I always keep to myself and never cause you to ok many problems. Even when I have gotten noise complaints, it wasn't frequent.

I would not consider myself a problem tenant at all. All that is wrong with me is my appearance. And there's nothing I can do because I'm white.

No one ever talks about clasisist discrimination. Not only thst, but I'm also autistic so I may appear to be a little eccentric to the few people I do interact with. But I've never stepped on any toes.

What can I do to protect my place of living?"
9,"Mortgage closing documents had wrong address on it, is there anyway I can work this to my favor?","So I bought a condo last week. On my closing day I signed a number of documents before being given the keys to my house.

&#x200B;

I got a call from my closing agent letting me know that I need to go back and sign with the title company again, because they messed up the address on the documents I signed. (They put the address number twice, so the address on the documents doesn't exist.) I heard some concern in my agent's voice, so it sounds like they really need me to go back and sign.

&#x200B;

While I'm usually a pretty ethical person, I have a personal grudge against banks since my parents were foreclosed in 2008 without being given any chance to get back on their feet. So to put it bluntly, is there anyway I can take advantage of the bank's mistake?

10,Parental threats because of psychoactive substance use and religious differences. Can I be eligible for asylum in another country because of my situation?,"I’m sorry if this was the wrong subreddit to post in or in a wrong format, I just didn’t know where to go.

A bit of background: I grew up in a more-devout-than-usual Catholic family in a predominantly Catholic country. This did not sit well with me as I grew up and eventually became an atheist. Recently, my parents discovered that I did not believe in God, and that I also used psychoactive mushrooms and cannabis to deal with personal problems. Even though I’m of legal age, I’m still in college. Upon learning that one of my college friends supplied cannabis to me, my father threatened to put me on a leave of absence from schooling and to report my college friend to the authorities. He planned on doing this by cracking down on all drug users in my college as repatriation for my actions, since it is still an illegal substance in my country. Knowing that they were innocent and did not deserve any of this, I reluctantly complied with any of my parents’ demands on the condition that no one be accused of any wrongdoing under our unfair laws. I feel very uncomfortable and unsafe within their presence because of their reactions, and fear the worst as revealing anything further about myself, such as my light bisexuality may result in violence. Unfortunately, my country does not afford any specific protection to individuals such as myself. I feel like my free will has been forcibly stripped away, and that I have no other roof to turn to at this point, which is why I am looking into asylum as an option. Is it appropriate in my situation?

TL;DR: Became an atheist in a hyper-Catholic environment, used cannabis & psychedelic mushrooms but parents found out and threatened to report my course mate supplier to the authorities until I had no choice but to comply to their demands. Expecting further potential violence with no legal protection."
11,Vet clinic is using tainted ketamine.,"A friend obtained vials of ketamine from a clinic and I injected it. I've done Ketamine before, and the disassociation feeling was definitely not completely Ketamine. It also made me very nauseous and caused me to non-stop vomit and faint for a day after I took it. I somehow convinced myself that maybe I was having a bad reaction because I drank a beer before, so I tried again, and had the same effect but it was worse this time. My roommate saw me getting sick and took me to the hospital and I now have mad hospital bills.

This is probably a long shot, but can I sue the vetinarian clinic or the distributor for having tainted Ketamine?

12,Lost Memories :(,"I dropped my wedding dress off about a year ago at a dry cleaners down the street from my house. I even had it repaired there as well. They called and left a message about 6 months ago saying that it was ready. I went in today to pick it up (as I lost track of time because I recently had a baby), and they told me that they had donated it a month ago. No calls, no messages, no emails, nothing. There is also nothing in my agreement with them that says that they can donate it if it is not picked up. Is there anything I can do legally to sue for the price of the dress/ emotional distress, ect. "

14,A failed applicant has accused our business of not hiring him or other black people on account of race — can he sue us based on that accusation alone? Can we sue him for slandering our business?,"We are in Cook County, Illinois.


My brother and I own a small business that we built from scratch while in college, and we're doing quite well. Recently, our manager left us to move out of state with his wife. He was and is a good friend of ours for a long time, and he'd been with us since we started up the business. Until now, we'd been hiring from among people that we know, or at the very least on the basis of recommendations from people that we know, there are many benefits to this, not least because we know who we're dealing with, and knowing who you're dealing with, liking them and feeling comfortable with them is just as important as, if not more important than on-paper qualifications.


To our dismay, we had a rough time finding people who we not only liked, but could do what needed to be done. So, we posted an ad online. Of all the junk we got, one application really stuck out, he didn't give a phone number and said that he didn't have social media to link to (red flag) but he was well qualified and I liked the way that he wrote, so I scheduled a meeting.


As soon as he came in and introduced himself, it became apparent to me that he had misrepresented himself in his emails, and within 5 minutes I was absolutely sure that he wasn't getting hired. His qualifications were good but I didn't like him, and he wouldn't fit in, so it wasn't happening. I rushed the interview along and got him out of my office, thinking that my actions had communicated my disinterest. We wound up promoting one of the guys that worked for us into the vacant position the next day, and easily replaced him in his previous role two days after that. About a week after the interview, the guy came in and asked about the job, I told him a version of the truth — that he didn't seem to be a good fit and we have already filled the position. Instead of graciously accepting what he should've already known, this guy had a tantrum!


He accused me of not hiring him because he was black, called us racists who would rather hire a less qualified white man over a black man with an MBA and said that ""it's obvious"" that we discriminate because all of our employees are white, and there's ""no excuse"" for that in Chicago. I told him that the reason that he wasn't hired was because I didn't like his attitude and I didn't think that he was a good fit and that going to school and getting pieces of paper aren't the only things that make someone qualified. I then told him to leave before I called the police, and then he threatened to sue us and called me a ""racist bitch.""

Does it sound like he has any grounds to sue us? Do we have grounds to sue him for slandering our business? I could really care less about the accusation itself, but it can hurt our reputation. **I am asking this here instead of going straight to a lawyer, as lawyers can be quite expensive, if it seems like we may need a lawyer we'll get one, but we don't want to spend the cash if it's nothing.**

Regardless of what goes on in our heads or what my brother and I say in private conversation with one another or with our wives, we have never given any public indication that we discriminate in our hiring process. Every instance that we have been in a situation of having to turn away a ""bad fit"" we have always given a plausible reason and haven't ever been stupid enough to say to them what we say to ourselves and one another. The composition of our workplace relative to the demographics of the area can be explained by the fact that we mostly hire from amongst our friends aka family, but I don't think that it need be explained, since as a private entity we aren't bound to any sort of racial quota."
15,Girlfriend's older brother forced her to sit down and watch certain videos which are against her religious beliefs. Is this domestic abuse? (update),"Ok so my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77mv24/girlfriends_older_brother_forced_her_to_sit_down) was downvoted and then locked. I asked if my girlfriend's big brother can force her to watch videos against her religious beliefs.

Trust me I believed you guys when you said that he can and it's a family matter, so I didn't call the cops or CPS. But I tried to talk to her parents to see what they think of the whole thing. I knew my parents wouldn't like it if someone showed me videos that we find very questionable and then quizzed me on them.

So I went and saw them and told them everything. They didn't like it at all. I mean, they didn't like it that I was talking to them. They told me that I have no right questioning what their son and daughter do and I should know my place. I don't know, I'm her boyfriend and I think I should have the right to be concerned about her wellbeing. They didn't agree.

A couple of days later my girlfriend came to me angrily that I shouldn't have gone to her parents. She says I tried to talk shit about her brother to her parents. But I only told the truth. I don't know why she's still loyal to him, he forced him to watch those videos. She should take my side but she took his side. I tried to press her on it and asked how can she not take my side, I'm her man and her boyfriend. She broke up with me.

I'm very hurt right now. Maybe I messed up. I was just trying to look out for her. Maybe I should have listened to all of you who told me to drop it. I don't know. Maybe we were not compatible. I don't think codependency is a good thing.

Anyway, thank you for your advice. It was the right one and I didn't listen and lost my girlfrienf as a result. "
16,"Tried to sue Equifax for data breaches, just got a letter in the mail. HELP!","So with all the craze that was going on lately with the Equifax data breach and thousands suing them across the country, I decided to take them to small claims court. The whole process was fairly easy, I just filled out some papers and was good to go. Well I showed up to the court date, and made sure the court delivered the papers. They did not show up and the judge automatically ruled it in my favor, and I was so happy I won some small change ($435.45). He looked kinda annoyed I was there, but anyway.

Then 2 months later I got a notice from the court saying that Equifax appealed the decision. Then I got a letter in the mail saying to show up to Superior Court instead of just a district court small claims place. I was sort of on edge, and just showed up last week.

It turns out they flew out a team of corporate lawyers from Manhattan. They filed a motion to dismiss and also a 2nd motion. The 2nd motion was for a counter-suit where they want all attorneys fees paid for a frivolous lawsuit. They also list ""JOHN DOE"" as another defendant and I read that means they put a placeholder so they can sue anyone I know. The judge just continued it and when I asked him how long it would take he said possibly years. And a court staff member told me to expect me to be served with papers at my home. The total amount might be in the hundreds of thousands. 

I do NOT have the resources and now I'm scared that they're flying out these lawyers and involving the legal system HELP! I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WANT TO CANCEL THE WHOLE CASE"
17,My sister's husband died and I am seven months pregnant by him. Our child wasn't in the will. Are we still entitled to anything?,"Spare me any moral grandstanding.

He died and everything was left to my sister and her kids. I'm pregnant and it's definitely his. My child wasn't in the will but since my child was fathered by him, am I/we entitled to anything? I know he left a lot of money behind but I'm not looking for half. I lost my job and I'm on the verge of being homeless, so just a small cut to tide me over is all I'm looking for.

18,Expelled from Texas public school for my afterschool milsim activities/nazi soviet cosplay,"Originally from AITA want advice on it

I  am 100% sure i am not the asshole here but i have lost my girlfriend,  and many other friends over this and its fucking pissing me off so much.  I am active in my local milsim group. Incase you're unfamiliar, milsim  is airsoft but take a lot further, often trying to replicate or reenact  battles from history. We had an event where we were reenacting the  battle of Kiev, 1943 which was fought between the 1st Ukrainian front  and the 4th Panzer army. We all wore either Soviet or Nazi uniforms, and  we had airsoft guns that looked exactly like Mosin Nagats, Kar 98s,  Gewehr 43s, mp40s, lugers and others. Our uniforms looked identical too  and we had soviet and nazi flags on both sides of our fields.

Now  clearly, none of us are nazis or communists, we've done many other ww2  events before, involving soviets and nazis, as well as Vietnam war,  Rhodesian bushwar, and other conflicts. Someone did take pictures of us  though and blasted us on social media and our school found out. They  expelled us instantly. they didn't care what we had to say, they said we  were with nazi flags and unfirosm which waas therefore offensive, so we  had to go. FUCKING SHIT. My parents are fuckign pissed, my dad took out  all my milsim shit and locked it up. He says im going to be grounded  for a long ass time. They're pissed and they don't care what i say.

Fuck  this and fuck my girlfriend and friends who all decided to unfriend me  and disassociate with me, you all are a bunch of fucking pathetic  cowards and fuck my school and everyone else who won't hear me out or  makes bullshit assumptions.

Now on to the advice, can the public schools actually expell me for this? we did this in a different city an hour away. Soemoene who just didn't like us found these pics and spread it around school saying we're nazis. I explained to the school admin that we're not nazis, and that this was just a military reenactment. They said they didn't care, we dressed up as nazis and we're getting expelled."
19,Creepy neighbor plays audio of me having sex [Michigan],"I'm 22. My boyfriend lives out of state and every time he visits me at college we of course have sex. Last Friday when we finished my neighbor knocked on the door and and went off on me about how loud we were being. 1. It was a Friday night. 2. We live on a huge college campus town so it's always really loud outside. But anyway I apologized, said I was really sorry for the noise and he left.
  
When I woke upon  Sunday I hear noises coming from the neighbor's apartment. It's the sound of ME having sex from the night before. Yes this creepy pervert recorded ME having sex and thinks its funny to play it really loud through his computer speakers! I banged on his door to get him to stop and he yelled ""I recorded this from inside my apartment. It's totally legal"".   
  
So now for the past week every time I come home he plays it really loud so I can hear it. I called the police about it yesterday. They said they would send someone out to my apartment but no one ever came.   
  
What are my rights?"
20,Is there a way my family can legally/forcibly obtain a portion of my brother’s ashes?,"My brother was diagnosed with an aggressive terminal illness and he passed five weeks later. The family wasn’t told until a week before he passed so we missed out on spending critical time with him. Not to mention that in that time he and his partner were busy making their plans without any care for the rest of us. My parent’s are very distraught over this entire situation. There will be no funeral, my brother was not buried but was cremated instead, and he had a will drawn up which excludes all of us even though he had no children and knows our parents are disabled. They also legally married right after he was diagnosed.

The money, the will, that’s one issue. But his partner is also refusing to share a portion of my brother’s ashes with us. My parents wanted a portion so that he may be “buried” with the family. They very much want a place to visit him now that he’s gone. His partner is being unreasonable and hiding behind saying it’s what my brother wanted.

I have told my parents we need to consult a lawyer, but they are grieving and feel there is nothing they can do over the situation. Is there anything we can do? We're getting railroaded into everything the partner wants...

Adding that we live in Texas."

23,Being harassed by neighbors for justified noise complaints (USA),"MA, USA. Single family - owned homes. 

Tonight 3 cops came to my home to inform me two families on my street reported me for harassment because I reported them for excessive noise and they let it slip that one of these families is claiming I’m targeting them for their race (which makes no sense because why would I be reporting the other family for the same thing if that was the case?)

How can I protect myself and my job? I have done nothing illegal or wrong and I just want these individuals to leave me alone and stop being so loud that I hear their nonstop noise from inside my house.

I told them I’m willing to have a mediated chat with the neighbors but if they aren’t willing to respect my needs too, I’m not backing down. Cops said they can’t set that up only Chief can. 

Backstory: I have neighbors who moved in about 8 months ago who have multiple children that play basketball in their driveway. This driveway is very close to my bedroom window in a neighborhood that used to be so quiet you could hear a pin drop. 

Even with my doors & windows closed & noise blocking curtains, I can hear the kids screeching til about 10 PM and the constant pounding of the basketball. The parents like to blast loud music and also play basketball. I regularly hear the kids saying racial slurs. It’s unpleasant. 

I tried to talk to them but the mom just ignored me. So I’ve reported them to the local PD every time I could hear them from within my home. The cops don’t do much except for the times it’s been the adults partying. They quiet down for a while and then start up again. 

I’ve probably called about 10 times over the span of 6 or 7 months because I wanted a record that I reported it in case I ever needed to escalate. It’s gotten to where I get panic attacks just being in my house from their noise. It sets off my anxiety to where I can barely function and the pounding of the basketballs triggers debilitating migraines. 

The guy next door to them, I called on once because he was having a loud party I could hear from within my house until all hours. This past weekend I called on that guy door again because he had a crazy loud party and was setting off illegal fireworks. 

The cops told me they can’t pinpoint where noise or fireworks are coming from, can’t do anything about it. They said there is no noise ordinance and kids will be kids. I tried to explain that I have a right to peaceful enjoyment of my home and I work from home and have health issues and they just said the kids will be kids. My response was “well the kids won’t but the parents should be willing to compromise”. 

They asked me several times what would be a reasonable time for quiet. I suggested 6 PM, they said no. I suggested 7 pm. No again. 8 pm, when I go to bed? No again. Why even ask me? 

I have purchased a decibel reader to get better record of how loud and obnoxious this is. I don’t understand why their right to be loud trumps my right to quiet enjoyment of my own home. Cops then suggested I host a projector movie party for the kids on my lawn. ?? No. 

The cops also informed both neighbors that I was the one reporting them despite my requesting them not to due to fear of retaliation. 

What are my rights here?"
24,Stealing Jewelry Insurance Paid For?,"Recently some friends invited me to go ""exploring"" with them thinking that we'd be exploring the woods and stuff along those lines but it turns out they wanted to explore old boarded up buildings. I don't want to go into too much detail but we ended up downtown which apparently has quite a bit of recent boarded buildings because of some really high profile riots and then semi-bad covid. We ended up in a jewelry store that looked like it had been ransacked as what glass was behind the wooden boards was broken pretty bad and a lot of the cases in the store were busted as well but the store was also cleaned out like the owner had left. I'm not sure if they were weak, lazy, or what it was but the cases on the floor weren't moved at all and we found a total of a small bit of jewelry under a couple of them. My friends took the jewelry and said that the stores insurance probably already paid for the jewelry that was reported stolen if the place was caught in the riots back then and even if it wasn't the owner obviously doesn't use the store anymore but I'm not sure if this is right or not. If this gets found out by them posting on insta or elsewhere can we get charged with stealing the jewelry even if we found it or what trouble would we be in?"
25,Could I successfully sue Speedway for this?,"Beginning of January I went into Speedway and an employee behind the counter verbally threatened me then came behind the corner to attack me saying he was going to “beat my as”. He didn’t attack me because his coworker held him back, but I did go to the police and he was arrested. After this incident I was told by the store’s supervisor I’m no longer allowed to come in the store if the gentleman in the store is there or his baby moms mom is there. I filed a complaint with speedways corporate office and after following up on the complaint I was told by corporate that I am able to go in the store no matter who is working, and to contact corporate if there are any further issues. Just today I went in there and the baby moms girlfriend of the gentleman who tried to attack me refused me service despite corporate saying this would no longer be an issue. Anyone who has had similar issues or dealt with these types of cases think I could have a successful civil lawsuit? The evidence I have is the camera footage of the gentleman trying to attack me and and the managers and coworkers at the location refusing me service despite what corporate has told them."
26,HELP!! Did I break the law?,"Edited for location: Arizona

A few months ago, my family was traveling in a car.  Myself, my wife, our at the time 17 yr old daughter, and our 6 & 7 year old children.  An argument broke out and everyone was screaming at everyone else (except the kids).  It never got physical.  Escalation continues until I start screaming at the 17 year old to ""Shut the fuck up"" because she is clearly out of line for cussing and screaming at her parents.  This is when the wife (driving) pulls over and leaves the car with the children.  I get in the driver seat and take off.  I over-steered my U-turn and hit a curb, jumped the median and destroyed my rim.  No pedestrians were around and there was no damage to any property other than my own.  As I'm changing my tire, a patrol car happens by and inquires if I need help, what happened, etc.  They interview the adults and then come back and arrest me for disorderly conduct.  Although I'm not sure exactly to what they are referring.

So I go to court and even though I don't believe I've done anything wrong, they offer to dismiss the case (1st offence ever) if I take anger management classes.  I accept as it seemed to be the fastest way through this whole thing.  Problem is, during my last pretrial conference, before I've had the chance to apply for council, the judge starts asking my all kinds of questions like why I was arrested and tells me that he may not honor the agreement unless I can prove that I've ""learned my lesson"". But I didn't do anything criminal!

I know my wife will not admit to anyone else screaming because she fears herself or our daughter getting charged with something, and the way this has gone so far, I don't blame her as that was all it took for them to arrest me.

​

Please help!  Should I throw out the plea and go to trial on principle?  Am I truly just ignorant of being on the wrong side of the law?!?"
27,"Might get kicked out of college for recording a harmless YouTube video, or so I thought. What do I do if it happens and what can I do?","Posting on behalf of my friend who is dealing with this issue and seeking an answer. Putting this on multiple places to see what everyone has to say so here’s what’s going on

My friend who is in college and has 2 years left till he graduates, He decided to start a motivational channel because he’s grown as a person and wants to help others around him that are like him and people in his community. He’s talked about dealing with social anxiety, getting in shape, dealing with relationships and other things of that nature. Hoping to reach out to people who were like him when he first started college

So up until last week he decided to take it up a notch and continue what he preaches and get out his comfort zone and go out there and do videos in public. I was the camera man in all of this and decided to help him out record. I do not attend the college by the way

Now if you ask me it’s the most generic stuff like pranks or social experiments and going out asking people questions, but truthfully it’s harmless. He just wanted to cater to the mainstream audience and grow. Now the video that caused this problem we made was “asking girls to rate themselves” with no catch. That’s all it was, us walking around his college campus and town asking not just girls but people in general what they rate themselves. Compared to other videos where people go around ask for body counts or more explicit things in public. We just asked people what they thought of themselves, We saw this as being harmless

We just walked around approaching people asking them if they wanted to be in the video and interviewed. And to those who said no, we just moved along and to those who said yes we recorded them and interview them. Everybody was fine.

We put it together and now we have the video ready and he puts it out and my friend promotes it on this app called yikyak which is used by college kids to talk about what’s going around town. And jeez when I saw the reaction to his video I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. I know it’s a stupid gossip app where people go and talk trash but I didn’t know it would lead to him being accused of sexual harassment and having to worry about getting kicked out of college 

He quickly became the talk of the town and people we criticizing and demonizing him. A lot of the people on there said that he was “sexually harassing” a lot of the girls on there and say he needs to be kicked out the college and taken down.

If you watch the video, these claims are absolutely disgusting, not here to promote the video just seeking answers.

At first we laughed this off. But due to influence a lot of the girls we’ve interviewed told the school and some want it taken down. For example. This girl in the thumbnail was perfectly fine being interviewed, even the next day at his job she passed by with her and her friends and chanted my friends YouTube channel slogan, then the next day she’s spamming people saying she wants it taken down. What sense does that make??

Now here’s where it the real questions come in. So the dean of the college wants to have a meeting with my friend in regards to his video and channel. The dean is known to power trip and threaten right away, he’s threaten to expel my friend from the college back then because he was still in the college dorm when everyone had to go home cause of the hurricanes, now that’s all fine. But he didn’t give a warning or anything just threaten to expel.

So when it comes down to it. What happens if the college kicks him out? What can he do? Can he pursue legal action? Does he have to take the video down? He knows that the college is private property but he attends the college and other students have recorded and token photos for other things, he’s already settled with not recording on the college campus anymore. But if the college kicks him out or makes him take down the video what can or should he do?"
28,I cashed a fraudulent check and now the bank is making me pay back all the money! (Ohio),"I was selling an item($800) on Craigslist and a buyer wanted to pay via check. He sent me a check in the mail but it was for much more than what the item was worth($3,000). He said it was a mistake that his assistant made and to wire me back $2000 and keep an extra $200 for my trouble and he would send a shipping company to come pick up my item. 

I cashed the check via mobile deposit so a teller didn't get to actually hold the check or anything but it cleared my bank in one business day and I wired him $2,000. He said he would be sending a shipping company out within the next couple days. I hadn't heard from him in a week so I thought the shipping company messed up, whatever. Then I get a call from my bank saying the check deposited bounced and they took the whole $3,000 back!

They informed me I got scammed via a check scam and there was nothing they could do. They said I'm responsible for paying them back when all I did was cash a check! How is it my fault that the bank cleared the entire amount of a $3,000 check without even verifying the funds?! This is insane!

Is there any recourse here?"
29,(Las Vegas NV) Landlord posted bogus 5 day detainer on my door. What should I do?,"I rent out a bedroom in a house. Been here for less than a month. On the 13th, the LL taped a ""three-day notice to quit for nuisance, waste, assigning/subletting unlawful business, or drug violation"" to my door. She did not serve it properly and she entirely made up the complaint on the notice, claiming verbal abuse and violence and claiming she was afraid for her life (completely fabricated, plus she has a habit of entering my room whenever she feels like without giving notice, which irks me). 
Today, the 17th, (LESS than 3 judicial days later), she taped a ""five-day notice of unlawful detainer"" to my door. This one is also improperly served. 
I can't tell if she's crazy, trying to scam me out of my rent money, or just mean and bored. I've literally done nothing to warrant any of this.
She's doing essentially everything wrong as far as the paperwork goes. I feel harassed and would love to move just to get out of the situation but can't quite swing it at this time. What do you guys think, should I just ignore these notices? Should I sue HER? I interact with her as little as possible and mainly just use the room to sleep when I'm not out working.

Really appreciate advice here. I'm not too worried because I feel that she's behaving in a ridiculous manner, but I want to make sure the courts also see it that way. I don't think she's filed either of these notices so far with the courts in any fashion."

32,"Can guys legally get in trouble for ""whaling"" or ""hogging"" contests in college?","Wanted to ask this because ""whaling"" is a pretty common tradition at the University I attend. I live in Illinois.

For those unfamiliar, here is the urban dictionary definition of the word ""hogging""

> A competition, usually between a group of men that involves going to a bar/frat/house party. Participants go with the direct intention of hooking up with the fattest girl at the party. The guy who bags the fattest girl wins.

Its sort of a tradition in our school and there is a lot of money to be won. 

In our school, a group of guys organize the competition (30 guys normally) and each pitch in between $100-250 (need to pay up atleast $50 to enter but most do atleast $100) and the winner is judged the next day. You need a pic of the girl with you and a text message between the two confirming sex. Winner takes all the money. Guys have to choose between 5 parties/clubs (chosen before the contest begins) and must go there.  

Anyways, recently a lot of girls have been getting triggered by this and some are threatening legal action and reporting the University. So far nothing has happened but in the case that it does, can guys legally get in trouble for this? Also what are our rights if the Uni. decides to take action? Can they do that?

Thanks"
33,[CA] Girl lies to owner of local hobby store and now I'm banned?,"Hi. I'll try to keep this brief.

I usually spend my Fridays at a local hobby store playing D&D and MTG. Over the years I have been playing there, I got a crush on one of the employees, A. She has a boyfriend, R, but I felt like I had to say something or I'd regret it, so I did. 

She told me she was ""flattered"" but not interested. I'm not the type to give up, and my dad told me persistence pays off, so I started bringing her flowers every day. Both at her work and her apartment. (I didn't stalk her, She lives close to the store and I've seen her walk home a few times.)

She took me aside on Monday and told me that she felt it would be best if I dropped out of the D&D group she runs for the store. I asked her if she was also kicking R out of the group, she said no, claiming that I was harassing her. 

Tuesday I went in and complained to the store owner, telling him about the situation, and how it's unfair that she is kicking me for having feelings for her, but not her boyfriend. I told him how unprofessional it is to hang out with her boyfriend at work. The owner told me he'd ""investigate"" and asked for my phone number so he could get back to me.

This morning I got a phone call from him, that after speaking with A and the other employees, I'm 'harassing' her, and he's decided to ban me from the store. I tried to tell him they were lying to him but he hung up on me. 

I want to sue him for punishing me for something I didn't do. Is there a specific type of attorney that specializes in this? Does the fact that I'm black and the rest of them are white give me any grounds for a discrimination lawsuit?"

Originally Bill was going to do 20 hours a week as a cook and 20 as a waiter. But then Paul decided that Bill was the only qualified cook we have and upped him to 40 hours in the kitchen. Because we don’t do overtime I am now not allowed to use him as a waiter, but I DESPERATELY need waiters, and bill really wants to do both. Now Bill is looking at working at another restaurant on weekends to work as a waiter, which is when I desperately need waiters. And we already pay way better than any restaurant in the area(he earns $20 per hour, everywhere else pays $15). So it would be better for Bill and for us, if he could work as much as he wants. But we aren’t allowed to give that much overtime, and our office manager says that it can’t be split into two jobs (I asked if we could higher him twice, once as a waiter and once as a cook.)

It just seems ridiculous to me that we are basically telling him to go work doing the exact same thing somewhere else, when we have those same exact shifts unfilled. Edit: and everywhere else pays less than we do. 

Any advice? We are in Maine USA.

Edit: Bill even asked if he could lie on his time card and roll the hours down the line until the end of the summer when he goes back to school, but we said no.

Edit: because some people are confused. Bill is looking at working 40hrs per week at $20 per hour with us, and then 20hrs per week at $15 per hour else where. I am trying to find a way for him to do that with us. Basically 60hrs per week at $20 per hour. We are not allowed to do salary. We are managed by an outside company. I want to keep Bill, just trying to find the best way to make it happen.

TLDR Edit again: basically this employee has two jobs and works 60 hrs per week in total. I want him to work all those hours for us and earn more per week than he does now. But I can’t because we aren’t allowed to schedule employees over 40per week."
35,Can a College Revoke My Degree 3 Years After I Graduate?[TX]-[CA],"I attended a prominent college in Texas with a decent reputation and ranking from which I graduated in 2014. During my time there I fell into a bad crowd and started suffering from numerous mental illnesses that led to me falling behind academically and being caught in a catch-up loop that prevented me from getting the grades I desired.

I'm now a graduate student in a PhD program in California which I got into on the basis of the diploma I obtained from the Texan university. Word of Mouth rumours have reached me that the semi-organized syndicate that I had obtained the work from has been busted and a lot of data files seized.

My main questions are, what are the chances that they will be able to identify my work as plagiarized?
If so can they revoke a degree 3 years later or is past the statue of limitations?
Can my graduate program kick me out based on the revoked degree?


I'm in a state of total panic right now as my life could be destroyed for no logical reason"
36,I’m a grad student and emailed executives at a large corporation a report I did on specific improvements they should make. I now see similar changes being implemented to what I recommended. What should I do?,"I realize that it’s entirely possible these are coincidences. I believe the company has around $6B in revenue, they’re publicly traded, and I was in contact with a VP. When I sent them my report in January, I asked for feedback, but all I got was a “thanks, I’ll take a look” and never heard from them again. 

I’m very active on LinkedIn for my job and have recently seen two things that have been implemented that I mentioned in my report. One of them was significantly changed but could have been inspired by my recommendation, and the other one is something I recommended based on what a competitor is doing. I don’t want to get more specific than that due to the industry and what these changes are. It would be really easy to figure out which company I’m talking about. 

Is this even worthy of a consultation since this isn’t anything more than suspicion at this point? I’m sure they have a big legal team advising them, but I never gave permission to use my intellectual property or signed any paperwork or anything. We barely even talked."
37,(TN) My defamation lawsuit against a disgruntled former employee was dismissed and now I have to pay attorney's fees. HELP!,"Title says it all. I'm in Tennessee and own a small bar/restaurant. I have a very disgruntled former server who created a massive tax liability for my business by accepting under the table paychecks. When this person quit, I demanded they sign a W-9 which they refused stating they were an employee and not an independent contractor even though they agreed to be paid under the table in the first place. I then gave them the option to pay back the payroll taxes that would've been withheld if they were an actual employee or accept a 1099. They again refused and began defaming my business on social media saying I had deliberately tried to misclassify them and that I was committing tax fraud. At first I tried reasoning with them with a cease & desist which they promptly posted on Instagram. When I tried filing a police report for harassment I was told it was a civil matter and not criminal. This individual then obtained the police bodycam footage of my report and posted that online. When I tried filing the second police report I was again told this was a civil matter even though my face is clearly visible in the videos they posted.

I filed a civil complaint in circuit court for defamation, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The employee then hired a slick attorney who filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that I was violating their right to free speech. The judge ruled the other party was in fact an employee and dismissed my case with prejudice meaning I can't sue them again. Personally I think there was a bit of judicial overreach as it's not a judges place to decide someone's employment status as thats a job exclusively for the IRS. What's worse, they expect me to pay for the other party's attorney fees even though I was the one being harassed and stalked. 

My attorney is relatively inexperienced and has never tried a case before an appeals court. As such, he does not feel comfortable representing me further in this matter. I've had consultations with other attorneys and the ones who will actually talk to me say I can expect to pay $10-20,000 just for the appeal and even then I could still lose and have to pay for their attorney's fees for the appeal as well. I'm considering representing myself, but I'm not sure what the process of that all entails so any advice would be super helpful. Meanwhile, the disgruntled employee is continuing to defame me and has now posted the order of dismissal online which has further affected my business. How is any of this even legal?"
38,I want to be able to see my son soon. Where do I start and how do I proceed?,"Some background before I begin.

A little after my high school graduation, I got this girl pregnant. We both graduated and were going off to our separate lives in a few weeks. I tried to convince her to get an abortion but she did not want to get one. 

Obviously, I was very worried. I was going to attend a big name university several states away and I could not afford to risk my career. I told my parents about this and they helped me solve the problem. I deleted all of my social media accounts, got a new number, and moved to my relative's house near the college I would attend. All of this was done pretty quickly (within a week).

I'd already finalized my college decisions and done everything I needed in regards to dorms and tuition so I was good.  

I've kept tabs on the girl through social media and she's been doing well. She did not get an abortion and our son seems to be doing fine. He looks incredibly similar to me so I'm not worried about the kid not being mine. He 100% is my son. My parents have also been keeping their own tabs on her and says both are doing well.

I'm graduating from college this year and my life seems to be set. I will be working with my father's company and i also made some great investments in the past four years (notably in cryptocurrency) so financially, I am very well off. 

I want to try and see my son and possibly try and get partial custody but I'm unsure how to approach this. My parents live int eh same state as them both so I won't be alone.

I'm not sure how I should approach this at all. Should I get a lawyer or will it not be necessary? What should I do first?

39,Can the police force someone to leave a public area for no reason?,"My friend was recently charged with criminal trespassing. There is an ongoing property dispute between her and the management at this location. She went to the leasing office of this condo complex to wait for a sheriff to arrive to file a report on the property, and the manager onsite instructed her to wait in the office. Then, the manager proceeded to call the police and reported her for trespassing. When the police arrived, they instructed her to leave and she refused to do so because she believed that she has the right to stay because 1) it's a public space that is inviting people to come in for business and 2) she is not causing any disturbance. She was arrested and charged with second-degree criminal trespassing.

State statute says:

**A.** A person commits criminal trespass in the second degree by knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully in or on any nonresidential structure or in any fenced commercial yard.

My question is, what constitutes as remaining unlawfully? Did the police have the right to ask her to leave or arrest her? I don't believe that a Walmart can ask a shopper that is not causing any trouble to leave the store for no apparent reason. If companies could do that, it could be used for all kinds of discrimination (such as restaurants in the past that didn't serve black customers).

What should my friend do? Any suggestion is appreciated."
40,COLLEGE OVERPAID ME STUDENT LOANS - NEED LEGAL ADVICE,"In August my school, USC, gave me my student loans, like normal. In October I received an email saying I owed them about $9000. I thought this was an error so I contacted Financial Aid via email. They told me that the school had made an error which resulted in an overpayment and that I now owe them $9000 or else I will be barred from enrolling and graduating. I have spoken with every department and they all say that yes, it was their fault but I still need to pay them back. Is there anything I can do? Is this fraud? Ideally I would like to defer the payment to go along with my student loans in the future, I don't see that because of their mistake it is stopping me from getting my credential needed to make money to pay them back.

41,Scammed Restaurant,Me and a friend used to do this scam a while back. Call a res-truant saying we ordered food that we never ordered and have it remade. So we would get free food. (super broke and could eat for free). But recently we did it again cause we both moved into a new city and were trying to try some food places for free. But one of the times I manager took one of our ids. and wrote the info down. Both we played it off like this was the wrong restraunt but he obliviously knew what was going on. We did not end up getting any food. But he does have our info. What if any would be the charge if he decided to call the cops? and if the cops did get involved what would my best action be?
42,What happens if you're forced to keep rescheduling court?,"Today I had a medical emergency shortly before I was supposed to go to court in Massachusetts for misdemeanor charges. So I called them and let them know what happened, and they rescheduled it. I'm wondering if I do this again on the next date, and again on the next, and every time I'm supposed to go what will they do? Also what if the emergency is so bad that I can't notify them, until long after the date has passed?"
43,Can I be evicted for making too much noise?,"I'm renting an apartment and last night I had a small get together with a few friends. We mostly just hung out on my outdoor patio and things were going just fine until one of my friends took offense to something that was said. I honestly don't even know what was said, but she was drunk and it apparently pissed her off enough to go after the other girl who made the question in comment. Me and my friend had to hold back the girl from charging after the other and all hell broke loose.

The pissed off drunk girl stormed after the other girl and began smashing things around my apartment. Long story short, I made everyone leave, but the drunk girl kept pounding on my door and even tried climbing over my patio to get back into my apartment. Multiple neighbors were coming out to see what was going on and one of them was some lady who screamed that she was calling the cops. She also screamed at me that I'm always making a bunch of noise and she said that she was going to the leasing office about me.

I actually got a letter from the leasing office explaining that I'm an ""ongoing disturbance in the community"" and cited multiple neighbors complaining about me and my noise-making in the past few months. The letter also mentioned a potential eviction and removal from the grounds if these issues continue. I'll admit to hosting the occasional party and acting a bit loud every now and then, but last night's episode was only the second time that things got heated to the point of a near fight breaking out. But the point is that I'm a good tenant who pays all of my bills on time. They can't actually evict me just because of some noise, right? Is this a bluff?"

45,My son door dinged a car in a parking lot and left his contact info on the windshield,"Maryland

He took a picture and left after waiting 15 minutes. The owner of the car is going to a body shop for an estimate. They have already stated to my wife that we can just give them cash if we want. 

I know people in the auto industry that fix door dings for a living that would make it cheaper for me and the quality of the repair is as good as a body shop. 

If she declines letting a company I know and trust do the repair, what should be my next step? She now knows my son just started driving and this would pummel his already outrageous insurance rates.

Thanks.

46,Missouri - refund of microtransactions due to developer mistake,"I'm one of those 1% gamers who spends large amounts of money in games to save time and effort. This particular game is a player vs player mobile game, and your spending can directly influence your power in the game.

The developer accidentally released a game pack during a sale that contains thousands of dollars worth of upgrade materials. I did not purchase this pack as I was offline at the time, and they took the pack offline after a couple of hours when they realized the mistake.Upon taking the pack offline, they removed components that had not been used, but are allowing the people who used them to keep the upgrades. 

This has resulted in an unfair balance shift in the game between those who were not offered a chance to purchase this pack (or use the components) and those who did. If I spent another 3,000 to 5,000 dollars I could replicate the contents of the pack, but those who purchased and used it immediately before the developer was aware of the issue only spent 20 dollars. I have spoken with the developer and offered to pay the same amount for the same benefit and they have refused. I have also requested they roll back all the accounts who received the unfair advantage and they have refused, saying it is to difficult to revert the spent components.

At this point, I have spent over 20,000 on this game, and a broken pack and a 2 hour oversight on their part has removed a large portion of my accounts value. They have made it clear they have no intention to fix this. Google will not assist me as the charges were over 2 years, and they only refund up to 48 hours. 

As for my losses, there is my investment in my account that has had is value deceased. That can be measured by the money I spent to get account where it was (top 5% of accounts) or by it's resale value and the decrease in that value (I have had offers of 10,000 for my account as recent as 2 weeks ago. I have reached out to the same people and now they wouldn't pay over 2,000 due to this pack being released accidentally and the increase of strong accounts available for sale).

Is there anything I can do to get my money back at this point? The moment I issue a charge back they will ban my account, which I am fine with as I am done with it after they invalidated the time and money I spent on my account. My primary concern is I doubt my bank would issue charge backs for everything as there was no card fraud."
47,[TX] My roommate is suing me after I informed her of eviction for endangering the home,"Hello,

I have a live-in ""tenant."" Basically I own the house and I am letting her rent out a room. It's all verbal agreement and there is no lease, no documentation at all. Her address on her ID is still her parents' house.

She has decided to begin partaking in extremely dangerous and irresponsible activities that I do not want myself or my young children exposed to. We don't need to get into details but what she's doing will very likely lead to killing us just by her occupying the same space. I am not joking.

So she has left the house for the weekend to partake in these activities, she left this morning and will be back on Sunday night. After she left I had a repairman change out all the locks on the house. I then called to inform her that she is evicted and she can either hire a moving company to retrieve her belongings (while she does not enter the house) or she can wait two weeks and come get her belongings herself.

She is now saying she is going to sue me for ""wrongful eviction"" but there was no lease, no signed agreement, I am not a ""landlord"" and she is not a ""tenant."" She is just some person who was giving me some money each month and I let her stay in a room. That's it. I don't believe she has the rights that she is screaming about so much.

I am honestly starting to feel fearful for myself and my childrens' safety. I have recorded conversations of her screaming and yelling at me, and text proof too. Can I use this to get a restraining order from her?

Please help I am really scared and I don't want to get hurt."
48,"Can my employer (the Federal Government) require any employee (contractor or federal) to appear on video chat while working from a remote location, such as their home?","Over the last few months my supervisor has encouraged us to appear on video chat during our meetings, but has not yet mandated it.  I have declined to appear on video while teleworking.  I am in my home and no one from my place of work needs to be inside my home, unless they are invited.  Not only that, while at home, I choose to dress in a less than professional manner, BECAUSE I'M IN MY OWN HOME, so I would not want my peers, subordinates, or supervisors to see me.

My supervisor is very passive aggressive in her request.  I can tell that they would like to make video chat a requirement but suspect that they cannot legally require it.

My question is:  Can my employer (the Federal Government) require any employee (contractor or federal) to appear on video chat while working from a remote location, such as their home?

Location is Washington, D.C.

Edit:  I'd just like to say thank you to the 3 assholes that answered from their point of view as managers (and that clearly have never worked for the Federal Government) rather than as legal professionals and then downvoted my question so that no one else will see it.  You are truly the reason why Reddit is such a shitty place.

The fact is, if I am completing the work that is expected of me, I think it is unreasonable of my employer to think that they can barge into my home by way of video chat.  I had hoped that this question might spark a dialogue about other issues with telework, but that  doesn't seem to be the case."
49,[NE] 2 CCW charges 3 month period.,"Trying to help a friend, we can call him Nike 

Nike was dealing with a single CCW charge but is now dealing with 2 CCW charges +  a unlawful transport 

The first charge. He brought completely on himself, literally. There was a fight at his relatives house that was to big to break up. He called the police under a false name to come break up the fight. Nike didn’t like the cops response time (too long) as this fight got worst Nike decides to call the police again  and tell them there’s a gun involved. It was true it was Nikes Gun but in no way was it involved in this fight Nike attempted to take the gun to his car. Let’s be honest fighting and guns not a good combo,  Nike underestimated the response time of a gun call , within 30 seconds of hanging up Nike walks outside gun in his hand to put it in the car police are already shutting there squad doors and drawing there weapons, *IM NOT SPEAKING FOR ALL COPS* but today’s time nature of the call black man, black  hoodie with a gun in hand. Russian Roulette, Nike Pockets the gun first to avoid initial contact with 3 officers w/ gun in hand. First CCW 


Second CCW. Nikes leaving the gun range to meet with his GF to get house keys Nike gets to car window of GF and she questions Nike about a .45 caliber round. GF does Uber, Nike Debunked this blame by going to his car retrieving his .9m and comparing rounds. Little did anybody know US Marshall’s were 3 stories above in the apartment building attempting to locate a murder suspect and watching all this unfold they rush Nike detain him and radios local police to take over Nike overhears US Marshall’s say “we thought that was him actually”   Nike is wanting to fight this CCW charge because he didn’t  conceal the handgun this time it was clipped to his front pocket in a open carry style 

Nike is a good kid clean record finished school the whole 9 yards, there were some very impulsive, uneducated decisions being made *ALOT* of factors played into the thought process if you knew  why, you would know why Nike did what he did just looking for advice I could pass on to him"

53,DWS Klamath County Oregon,"I was pulled over because my turn indicator was out, and they sited me with a driving while suspended. The officers were super nice, even though he did ask to search the vehicle 3 times. Eventually he stopped asking when I looked him straight in the eyes and told him it would be a waste of time. I was clearly targeted. My van is older, grey, pretty run down. I just bought it, and hadn't had a chance to fix the body damage and paint it yet. That's what I do for a living I fix and flip cars. I am also permanently disabled through SSI. So I don't have much income, and definitely cannot afford a lawyer.  


It's $1000 for a lawyer, and I feel like I'm being pushed through a meat grinder. The guy in front of me in the trial where we enter a plea had terminal cancer, and they stuck him with a payment plan that I'm %100 sure he's never going to pay. He had all sorts of other tickets. Anyway they don't offer a court appointed attorney on violations, but they are threatening me with a warrant for my arrest if I don't drive the 5 hours down to Klamath on Oct 14th to come to trial at 5:15 PM.   


I don't know how they expect me to get there, and I'm really curious why I was never given the chance to have a suppression hearing, because I was using my hands signals, AND the police officer didn't use his turn indicator when he did a U-turn to come and follow me. I guess I'm held to a different standard of the law then a police officer?

&#x200B;

I've dealt with the courts before, and they don't care about me, or my situation, or my SOB story. I know they must deal with 100 a day. I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to avoid getting this violation or having to drive all the way to Klamath from Portland. With no Lawyer it seems like I'm in danger.  There is no way for me to know what they are going to charge me with, or fine me with, or if they are going to send me to jail for this. I really have no way to find out. I called around all morning and they withhold this kind of information from people for whatever reason.

&#x200B;

Because of my condition I am honestly waking up every morning terrified of what might happen. I barely sleep as it is with everything going on, and this is pushing my mental health over the edge. It may seem like a simple thing to most people, but for me the reason I have my mental illness is because of the court system/government. 

&#x200B;

I know I've said a lot of things that don't matter when it comes to matters of the law, but I'm trying to get some help here. I really need it badly. What are the next steps for me to take to handle this. I really need some help.

55,Can I sue my beekeeper neighbor?,"Every day i see my neighbor's bees flying around my garden stealing the pollen or nectar from my flowers. Then the bees go back to my neighbor and creates honey. My neighbor then harvests the honey and sells it at the farmers market for profit. I have never recieved so much as a jar of honey as compensation and everyday my neighbors bees trespass and steal my flowers. I was stung once when I was a child, so i know how dangerous bees can be. 

The way i see it, this is equivalent to a persons dog coming into my yard to steal balls or tools then gives it back to his owner who then sells it for profit. 

Do i have legal ground to sue? What type of things should I begin documenting in order to prepare for a legal battle? What would be a fair settlement amount if my neighbor doesnt want to take this to court? Thanks for the help."

I decided to talk with an attorney and just told him about the whole situation. He seems like a good lawyer but he told me that I will probably only get visitation for a while, if at all. I told him that I will try to reach out to my ex and then get back to him.

So I did. I tried searching for my ex's phone number but I couldn't find it. I decided to contact her via Facebook instead. I made an account and sent her a long apology telling her how sorry I was and how I was ready to make up for everything and be a dad. She did respond but she told me to fuck off. 

I sent her another message asking if he was my son (just wanted confirmation) and she told me that I was the ""sperm donor"" and not his father. I did ask if there was another man in the picture and she said no, so I won't have to worry about that.

After that, I asked if we could meet up in person or talk on the phone and she said no and told me to never contact her again and then stopped responding to my messages.

I'll be meeting with my lawyer tomorrow and will have him file for paternity and then go from there. My parents are also supportive of me reaching out and are helping me every step of the way, so that's great. "

I will be receiving a check for $100K in a few months from a workers compensation settlement, but with that I would like to form a corporation/LLC. I would put the entire $100K into the corporation. 

I am currently not working, receiving disability, as well as a variety of other low-income state and federal programs. 

Now for my **questions**

1) Should I file for bankruptcy? 

2) If I file for bankruptcy as an individual, should I do so before or after I form a corporation? 

3) Is there any way to protect the assets of a corporation through an individual bankruptcy; if so, what process?

4) What lawyer would I seek for this? 

5) Will I be able to keep my credit cards open still, as I love the cards I have, and have been on time, responsible, etc. 



I mainly want to file for bankruptcy *but* I want to do so in a way which will protect either an existing or a soon-to-be corporation and its assets (such as the $100K I’d put into said corporation)."
62,Generic Birth Control Caused Pregnancy,"My wife just started using  generic birth control and became pregnant immediately. We only hooked up once all month! And she doesn't miss a dose, no drinking, no other meds.

I thought generic was the same as name brand, and that's how it was presented by the doctor. The generic pill manufcturer also makes the name brand, and they don't seem to indicate there's a difference. But I found a gynocologist in NYC who states one of the top 5 reasons for pregnancy while on pill is generics and the FDA allows a 15% variance of ingrediants from generics, and with low dose pills this is a concern.  [https://www.healthinfi.com/chances-of-getting-pregnant-on-the-pill/](https://www.healthinfi.com/chances-of-getting-pregnant-on-the-pill/) 

Obviously I realize lots of people get pregnant on birth control. What I'm upset about is that the generic is sold as if its the same as name brand. Even the insurance company probably wouldn't have paid for name brand due to it costing 10X+ the generic. My question is - What kind of legal ground do we stand on? We already contacted a big name malpractice firm that seriosly considered but decided not to pursue due to cost of such a legal battle.

Adding insult to injury, my wife is not as young as she once was. She has had complications, bleeding, pain, headaches, bed rest. So in addition to the financial hardship this creates, there is pain and suffering. I am conviced the name brand could have avoided this. But who knows for sure. I feel like they could put sugar pills in the case and we still wouldn't be able to fight this goliath of a drug company in court. They can just say it's 99% effective while it might be 0% effective. How can someone really know? Any legal advice is appreciated."
63,Police served arrest warrant on girlfriend confinscated my laptop as evidence,"The police force entry to my home on O.R arrest warrant, handcuffed me and removed my girlfriend to police station for questioning.
Right from the start 2 officer's began searching my up stairs bedroom. Tried to question me but stated over and over that I'm vary private person and value my privacy. Asked if I was being detained am I free to go officer stated that i was being detained not free to go. I stated clearly that I do not concent to any searchs or seizures of my property. So here's the thing they found my laptop on the upstairs bed asked me if said computer was mine I replied yes. Officer's asked for proof that said laptop was infact mine and not my girlfriends. At the time I didn't have the reseat.
Officer said that I could prove that it's mine buy loging on with my password to let them have a look around. I replied that I'm vary private person and value my privacy so they confinscated it as evidence. My girlfriend never used my laptop infact I'm vary nosie person and made multiple iPhone backups of hers to Snoop around, crack her password and ripped open all the meta data from installed
Apps. A reasonable person would not believe that she would tolerate such an invasion of privacy. I'm worried that the backs not passworded would be used against her as she didn't give her phone passwords to the police.

64,My cousin lied about my nephew stealing her truck,"The situation is that my nephew went to my cousin's house and borrowed her truck while she was out of town. He got caught speeding on the highway and he was charged with speeding 75 km over the limit. Under the law here if you speed more then 50 km it is automatically a stunt driving charge as well. This means your car gets towed and impounded. The police called my cousin because it was her truck. She came home the next day and even though she knows my nephew she told them he stole it so she could get it out of the impound lot, because if the vehicle is a stolen one they have to give it back to the owner.

The thing is she knows my nephew but she's saying she never gave him permission to take her truck and he was never allowed to drive it and has never driven it ever before. His parents told her they would pay the impound fees for her but she still reported it as stolen because she didn't want to wait to get it back. Normally if you can't pay the fees you have to sign the vehicle ownership to over to the lot so they sell it to get their money and she said she didn't want to do this but his parents offered to pay. She also gave the police copy of the footage from the camera outside of her garage that shows him climbing through a window. So besides the speeding, stunt driving and theft charges he's being investigated for breaking and entering. He's never had trouble with the law and he was supposed to start college in less then 2 weeks. Her lie is going to ruin his whole future.

What can we do for him and to make the police believe her lie? She knows him afterall.

65,"Mom opened my mail, Called the police, and police confiscated my Research Chems!!!","I am 22 by the way

I know there are going to be comment's like why are you ordering RC's to your moms house but hear me out... I just want to know if what this police officer did was legal and if not what I can do about it.

Research chemicals are for ""RESEARCH PURPOSES"" and not human consumption. Research chemicals can be legally obtained on the surface web and there is no law against ordering them to do your own research. This is what I told my mom and the officer. What happened was my mother opened a package addressed to MY NAME and called the police saying that I was illegally ordering ""drugs"". The officer showed up and told me ""you shouldn't have this crap, your lucky im giving you a warning"" and he confiscated my research chemicals.

2 Questions I have..

So first off, its a federal offense and a felony to open someone else's mail as long as they are over 18 correct?

Second off how the hell is a police officer allowed to take something that I legally purchased with the intent of doing research , and then threatened to charge me if I didn't forfeit it over to him?

Yes I know it may be wrong to order certain things to my parent's residence without their permission but in terms of the law there are a LOT of crooked things going on here."
66,Court terminated my parental rights and gave custody to my sister. Any way I can fight this?,"My husband and I lost custody of our daughter to my sister. Our parental rights were terminated on the grounds of abandonment.

I left my daughter in care of my sister back in 2013. My husband was offered a job outside of country, but I did not want to take my daughter along because she has medical issues and had just started school. We had a guardianship agreement and we were supposed to come back to the US the following year. However, my husband's contract was extended so we stayed.

The custody battle started in 2016 when my sister tried to receive government aid for my daughter. I was ordered to pay child support, which I happily did. My sister wasn't satisfied with that and petition for custody again in 2018. They terminated our rights this year. They claimed we abandoned her because we had not seen her since 2013 and paying child support did not count as being a part of her life.

I really want my daughter back and we plan on coming back home to the US either later this year or early 2022 for certain. Is there any way I can regain custody of my daughter?

67,I can't allow my wife to get custody.,"Throwaway for safety even though she does not use Reddit.

Context: North Carolina, married 1 year, have a 1 year old child. She wants to go through this separation process and then divorce process without a court involved and very civilly. She wants me to help her move out with a smile on my face and be happy for her etc etc. I was blindsided by the divorce and have been rather devastated for the past months since the conversation was had.

Problem: Since the conversation she has been going out on the town every Friday-Saturday with her coworkers and coming home between 2-4 am. She typically goes from work to bar on Friday and then leaves in the afternoon on Saturday. One time she was ""too drunk"" and stayed the night at a friends coming home at one in the afternoon the following day hungover to the point where she spent five minutes with our son and then immediately took a four hour nap.

Tonight our son started choking. I don't know what, he was in the crib and hadn't swallowed bathwater/didn't have a bottle in the crib etc. I called her and was sent to voicemail and then followed with a text stating that there was a problem. This is my first child and I'm an only child with little to no baby experience, she also only has our son but claims she raised her siblings, naturally I thought she would have some sort of knowledge that I am unaware to.

The phone call was incredibly one-sided after she acknowledged and returned my call THREE hours later. The call went as follows:

/attitude/

""Hey, is everything okay?"" Her""It is now, i was really freaked out for a while."" Me""What happened?"" Her""X was choking"" Me""What was X choking on?"" Her""I don't know, he didn't have anything he could choke on... that's why I reached out to you. He stopped breathing and was turning blue"" Me""You're his father, I don't see why this involves me, can't I get just ONE night out with my friends?"" Her""Blah blah I'm upset she said she wasn't concerned with our son and is staying late and is now committing to a long night blah blah""

There's more but I feel it's less about our child and more about our awful relationship at that point.

She hasn't talked to legal advisers as far as I know - but she's planning on attempting to take a 72%-28% without talking to a lawyer and just moving out. I don't know if I can live with myself if this somehow happens... What do I do to prove she's a terrible person and unfit primary guardian?? Help?!?

I thought I would be all good to go and I wouldn't need to post again so I deleted the throwaway I used. Well, it turns out I have no self-control at all when it comes to money. Instead of waiting for my wife and I's divorce to be finalized, I went over to my mother's house and tried verifying the gems and seeing if I can get a cash value. I checked with quite a few verified sellers and jewelry shops and the entire stash is worthless. They are all either fakes, broken, or have little to no cash value. This is honestly the most disappointing thing in my life right now, apart from, maybe, my wife. 

It is what it is, I guess. My wife and I's divorce is going pretty well. I spoke with my wife about the divorce and thankfully, she wants one as well. We weren't getting a long and I cheated on her so its better to get a divorce before she finds out and tells our kids. Thanks for the advice everybody."
69,Do I have a case?,"A friend of 2 years who has flaunted & gloated about how much money he has (well off of $5 million) offered to give me $100k for my student loans and to help with my dad (who is currently being removed from his place of residence). I accepted this offer (in March). This friend then attempted 2 wire transfers, the first one was denied by the IRS with no explanation and the second one was taking too long. Then he claimed he mailed a cashier’s check that never arrived. Then he mailed another check in which I received the envelope just to find a blank piece of paper. I have his letter of intent with his bank information and the bank’s number as well as screenshots and pictures showing the wire transfers, the checks, and his bank balance. This friend ghosted me when confronted about the blank piece of paper. If I were to sue this friend for going back on his offer/ promise and for the emotional distress of waiting 
on this money for 2 months especially to help my dad who is currently in a crisis, do I have a solid case against him?"
70,"[FED] I'm about to bring an attorney a ""smoking gun"" as an expert witness in a multimillion dollar federal class action lawsuit. I have no idea how to get compensated.","Dear Legal Advice Community,

I am an anonymous engineer about to meet with a licensed attorney regarding a federal class action lawsuit he filed that I read about in the newspaper. It turns out that I am aware of a ""smoking gun"" flaw in the product he is not aware of, that may help affect the success of his multimillion dollar case. 

Not only that, but I have performed extensive legal research myself into the issue and how the ""smoking gun"" would affect legal cases such as his moving forward against other similar defendants. I have devised a theoretical legal doctrine that is very promising, and in fact, superior to the doctrine he based his current lawsuit on. I am not an attorney, but I am intellectually gifted and I am confident. 

However, one thing I am not is an experienced expert witness! I've never done this before, although I do have above average knowledge of how our legal system works. I would be grateful for your advice on this. 

Firstly, how much would a good ""expert witness"" get paid? I normally would get $100 an hour or so for my skill level of engineering. But I'm also bringing a smoking gun to prove the product is flawed and deadly dangerous to human life. Do I ask him to pay me now just for meeting with him the first time? Do I only get paid at trial time next year? Do I ask him for a percentage? I'm clueless.  

Also, how do I present to him my theoretical legal doctrine, without giving it away for free? It could literally be the basis of him making a career out of this. I.e. he could take a look at it, tell me I'm not an attorney, and shuffle me out the door, then simply use the White Paper I brought him. 

Pretty please with a cherry on top, I need help and advice with this. I know what I know, but I don't know shit about being an expert witness in a federal lawsuit(s). "
71,UPDATE I’m in highschool and money was stolen from my bank account. I need help NOW,"

Thouhgt I should give an update. Thanks everyone for the advice. I still felt like I should try going to the cops, but everytime I wanted to, I kept getting nervous and chickened out. That lasted about a day, then it turns out my dad looked got a call from the bank and he went absolutely apesh*t.


They stopped all the checks and took my checkbook away. I have no idea if they got the money back from my friends, my dad left for work for a week and he’s not talking to me.

I probably won’t see him for a while because I leave for my trip this week and I’ll be gone for a while. I’m only getting $300 for the trip this time instead of $1000, but I guess it makes sense that im punished somehow.

Biggest lesson learned: don’t mess around with a checkbook, or if you need to, make sure to write void on the checks.

73,"I have a good one for the experts, consumer law","Hi, So I bought 2 items from Walmart dot com, each item is the same and the listing has two prices, $1221.37 and $0.73/per item, clearly stated. Now I bought two of these items and was charged 2607.37 with tax.

Link to law
https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359-81903_20942-134114--,00.html

Even if it is a mistake, Walmart is obligated to the lowest marked price on the listing as well as an additional %10 of the difference as a bonus for the misrepresentation no less than $1 no greater than $5.

So according to law I was charged incorrectly. Walmart now owes me the 2607.37 charged plus an additional $5, then subtract the actual cost of $1.43. Roughly $2610 is owed back to me.

My question is, I contacted Walmart to let them know of the issue, Walmart told me that their Terms of Service is what they follow not the state law and this protects them.

So is walmart right? Do they trump state law?"
74,Is what this restaurant manager did/how he acted legal? (Indiana),"I took my siblings out to dinner tonight at a popular chain restaurant (it’s Australian themed) and when the check came I wrote check for the $83 bill. I was told that they don’t accept checks, which I found odd because it’s a major restaurant and a major form of payment, the manager came out and said that they don’t accept checks because checks can bounce, I explained to him that it isn’t like back in the day where checks took a week to clear, you can check if a check is going to bounce instantly, but beyond that I didn’t know what to tell him because I only had like $50 in cash on me for the tip and gas and other things and I don’t carry any cards, he said that I need to go and cash the check and come back and pay. I said alright (even though that’s ridiculous) he said that one of the kids should stay at the restaurant so he knows I won’t just not come back, I said absolutely not and that since he won’t accept my payment he will just have to trust me. We walked out to the car and I got the kids in and he and another guy stood behind my car so I couldn’t back out and yelled swear words at me and the kids, after like 5 minutes I revved the engine and started to pull out so he would jump out of the way and then I drove away, went and found a check cashing place, and came back and paid the bill. I was tempted to not come back after their disgusting behavior but I thought that would be a bad lesson for the kids. 


Is what happened, between not clearly posting that a common form of payment isn’t accepted, to trying to hold one of my siblings as collateral, to blocking my car in any way legal? I am not pursuing it but I want to know, I really hope not because that was all so ridiculous."

77,"30 Years Old, no criminal background, Wichita KS. Today I was put in cuffs and slammed against a window over an energy drink I didn't steal.","I went to a local Dillon's today (grocery owned by Kroger).  When I go shopping there, I tend to pick up a Monster Energy Drink and drink it while I shop.  I always pay for them.

When I grabbed one out of the store fridge today and opened it, I noticed it was flat and dented.  I threw it away in the trash can in store, and grabbed a new one.  I paid for the new one with my groceries on the way out.

A manager and (I could only assume, since his badge was backwards) a security guard stopped me just outside the doors, placing a hand on my shoulder and asking me to come back inside.  I did, when we got back in the store they pointed to a steel door and obscure staircase and told me to go up it.  I refused.

They told me that I damaged property and that it was stealing, I told them it was damaged when I picked it up and threw it away.  I apologized for not bringing it up to an associate, but they didn't care.  The (assumed) security guard kept telling me I needed to just ""come upstairs and make it right"" and told me I should pay for the drink.  Apparently my opening it meant I had damaged the already damaged product.

I refused to pay for it, refused to go upstairs, they told me they'd call the police if I didn't comply.  I sat by their ice chest telling them that I would wait until the police arrived.  While I waited, I called 911 and explained that I have extreme anxiety problems and asked that they inform the officers that I was stepping out for a cigar and attempting to calm down.

In the process of heading out, two officers came in the door.  They asked me to come back inside, and I did.  I explained that I was on the phone with 911, while one officer demanded that I go up the same stairs the security guard had indicated earlier.  I refused, and told the officer that they could take me to the police station, but I would not go up those stairs.  Now is a good time to mention that I'm on medication for bipolar disorder and severe anxiety.

As I was telling the officer that I would go to the police office, I felt one of them sliding a handcuff over my wrist behind my back.  No warning, no nothing.  I panicked and tried to turn to see what was happening, and an officer restrained me as they continued trying to put on the cuffs.

Edit - I remember that I did turn back and forth asking what they were doing, and trying to see.  I did try to remain calm after I realized there was no sense in struggling.

I settled down and waited, but then they started dragging me up the stairs again.  I panicked, and tried to back away.  I told them I wouldn't go up, but would go to the station.  I struggled hard, and one officer shoved me (face-first) against the store window while they checked the cuffs.  They tried again to drag me upstairs, and I guess I braced my foot on the door to try and stop.  It was terrifying, and by the time they got me upstairs I was nearly in tears.  They were telling me to comply, I was shouting that I would but I would not go up the stairs.

In the office upstairs, I argued with the officer that he couldn't do this and that it was assault.  I felt like it was.  I told him I wasn't under arrest and hadn't been read my rights, so it was wrong.  He told me that it wasn't assault, that I was under arrest, and that being in cuffs means that I'm under arrest. Once he said that, I did my best to settle.  I sat, calmly for the rest of the I don't know what to call it in the office after being told I was under arrest.

Inside I was at full panic.  I explained to someone that I had mental issues I am being medicated for, and suddenly everyone calmed down.  A high-ranking officer showed up to review the tape of the 'arrest' because of my screaming and flailing while being cuffed.  I'm guessing someone had called the police?

Anyway, I gave them all of my information, and told them my side of the story when asked.  The whole time choking back tears.  They told me they were giving me a ticket, but the aggressive officer and security guard kept talking to me.  ""You understand why we had to stop you.  You understand the stores reasoning?  I did tell you you were under arrest.""  The security guard repeatedly equated himself to the police telling me about how they did their jobs.

Finally they wrote me a ticket and said I could go, telling me about a court date next month.  Two important things, when I was being cuffed and cooperating (prior to being dragged upstairs) I called the security guard a ""small-dicked faggot.""  Not my brightest moment, but I'd better own up to it now.

Also, my left wrist and thumb are completely numb after the struggle.  I have cuts and impressions from the cuffs, but they adjusted them and made sure they fit after I told them about it.  I made sure the officer noted the complaint in his report.

What do I do?  I don't get in legal trouble, and I feel like I should just pay whatever ticket and move on, but I also don't think this is fair or right.  I feel like I've been wronged...  Have I?  Should I do anything?

79,hit and run case,"I was involved in a hit-and-run accident.  then a few minutes later  police caught me. they didn't see it. they just assumed it was me  because i was close and the person said the color and model of my car is  the same as the person that hit me. The police gave me a misdemeanor  charge for hit and run. they didn't ask for insurance or anything.  didn't even give me a ticket for no insurance. there's practically no  damage on my car at all, except a little scratch in the front. i hit her  in the parking lot going 5 miles an hour at most.  her insurance called  me today, asking to identify my insurance. i gave them nothing, saying  it wasn't me. they saying they got a police report.  anyways, what do  you think happens here? if i settle the criminal charge in court, which I  think i will. Do i still have to pay for damages? I don't think court  can screw me for no insurance anymore? The person can still sue me  correct? can i later just tell them i will pay for it without saying  anything about insurance? or do i settle payment in court? the court is  just criminal case i think.  whatever i have to pay is a separate  charge, but if i'm found not guilty, then she doesn't have much of a  case to sue me for damages correct?  I think they missed the no  insurance criminal charge, so they can't come back to that. However,  what happens with the person who is trying to get paid for damages? do  they ask me personally or sue me? I know they can still do a separate  civil case. Is it possible for me to settle later without giving  insurance info? Or will their claims agent not work with people  persoanlly?"
80,[California] Weird Question about age of consent,"No, not that kind of question. I have a 4 year old son who is going to be 5 in September. His birthday is early enough in the month it is before the cutoff and he would be able to start Kindergarten this year. If he did, he most likely would be the youngest student in his grade. My wife and I are currently debating whether or not to start him this year or to wait another year. He's a smaller little guy but has made friends with children that will be starting school this year. She would like to hold him back so that he doesn't have to be the smallest kid in class, but I would like him to go to school to be with his friends. However due to being a legaladvice lurker I have another worry about holding him back:  
If we hold him back now he will be 18 years old for his entire senior year. We live in a state where the age of consent is 18 and no Romeo and Juliet laws exist (perhaps there will be in 13 years, but that is unknown) I worry that if we don't start him at school now, that we are setting up liabilities that don't need to be there. Both my wife and I are were the nerdy sort that didn't really have overtly sexual relationships until college, and were both raised with the ""save sex till marriage"" message. While we don't really believe in that message completely, we do sort of both think kids shouldn't be having sex in high school and will be raising him with the same message. That being said, we aren't going to not tell him about sex, so there's a chance he'll engage in it anyway. I don't want him to get in a relationship with the wrong girl (or boy! Pretty sure he likes girls but you never know) whose parents are more conservative and get in a bad situation if they find out that something is going on.   
 I recognize that even if we let him go to school now he could end up in a relationship with a younger person, but he wouldn't be 18 till he was hopefully away in college and therefore less chance of being charged with statutory rape.  
  I wonder if I'm being over concerned about this, but I keep reading here about people strongly suggesting their 18 year old still in high school not touch any of their other classmates and people freaking out when they hear about an 18 year old in a relationship with a  15 year old(which is only senior-sophomore). This is really weird to me because I had many friends in high school who started dating girls who were freshmen when they were seniors. One of them kept the relationship up all through college and eventually married. Apparently their first time might have been the night of her senior prom. Another friend was seeing a freshman when she was a senior and she definitely came back and slept with him once after she started college. I don't really see her as some creepy predator, but  things seems to be handled differently 17 years ago. My own wife and I are 5 years apart (we of course met much later). Back when I was in high school if the cops rode up on 2 kids in a car and found them having sex, they would usually ID both of them and then send them home if everything looked consensual and they were both in highschool, maybe call the girls parents if the guy was 18. I think that now-a-days that if it showed one of them was over 18 mandatory reporting laws would kick in. And I don't even want to think about the sexting thing.  

**To boil it down my question is this: Will there be anymore liability if my son waits another year to start school, and thus be 18 for basically all of his senior year, or am I being overly concerned/ it doesn't matter he could still get in to deep trouble?**

What basically drove me over the edge with concern about this is something my boss's son recently went through. We had all heard that he had a run in with the law recently (which surprised us because he was a 4.0 gpa nerdy type kid) but didn't know what. Over the 4th we had a small company party and later in the day our boss got a little tipsy and gave us the lowdown. His son turned 18 in March, and in May went to a concert at a local 18+ club. He though he lost his phone at the concert, but it turns out that he got pick pocketed but the police had cought the guy for something else right outside the club because our boss got a call on the Monday after saying they had his son's phone and all he had to do was drive back out there and get it. Being a teenager his son didn't lock the phone and didn't try find my phone because he had turned it off for the concert. So my boss just told his son and he drove out to get it. My boss gets a call a couple hours later from his son who has been arrested. It turns out the police had gone through the phone to determine who it belonged to. I guess there were some racy texts between his son and his son's girlfriend (who is in the same grade but turns 18 in July) that mentioned she was in high school, and he also happened to have a bunch of nude pictures she sent him (that he was keeping with her knowledge and permission) And this piqued their interest and when he came to retrieve his phone they threw him in an interrogation room and got him to admit that he had the pics and that his girlfriend was still 17. Luckily my boss knew a guy who knew somebody that has been dealing teen sexting cases. Long story short, his son got off, but the poor girl got super embarrassed, her parents tried to file a restraining order against his son, and he may or may not have lost admission to the college he was going to be going to in the fall. What really struck me was my bosses description of the prosecutor. He said the guy would not be reasonable and was trying to throw the book at his son, threatening him with being a registered sex offender, molestation charges if they found out he had sex with the girlfriend after his 18th birthday, soliciting for the texts. My boss said he couldn't understand why this guy was going for such blood. The way my boss explained it was that his son only got off on a technicality. Sounded like something to do with the police not having any kind of warrant to search the phone and that they had no reason or permission to search the texts or pictures since there was clearly a contact labled ""DAD"" in his phone book. My boss and the lawyer had a very long talk with the son afterwards and explained how dangerous a situation he had set up for himself. "
81,"[NJ] Got my girlfriend and her family deported. I deeply regret it, help!","My girlfriend of three years and I had a falling through when she cheated on me with a close friend. It was a mutual friend that told me what was happening and after confronting the woman I was deeply in love with she admitted to the cheating. She admitted to doing it a year into a relationship and since she was very drunk (I was too, we got drunk before I brought it up) she was very honest about everything.

Well, I couldn't control my emotions and I spent a week snorting speed/drinking hard alcohol. I experienced amphetamine psychosis, took some xanax to take the edge off and while I was high I decided to call immigration services to report my illegal immigrant girlfriend as a way to get revenge. Last night, a month after this all happened, I've been informed that they're in deportation proceedings and that their house had been raided (as I also reported this neighbor (my girlfriend) was a heavy drug abuser. They found marijuana and LSD in the house so she's also facing jail time before they deport her.

I did not want this to happen and dont know what to do! I feel deeply guilty and regret acting on my emotions, I love this girl and it wasnt fair of me to be selfish. She did wrong but that didn't merit me ruining her and her family's life.

Is there anyway I can take back what I said? Cancel the charges? please help me, I cannot stand the reality of what I've done. "
82,Someone I follow on IG posted a story of himself driving 170 mph on the freeway. Can I report him?,"The person driving the car lives in Los Angelas, CA which is a different state from me. I screen recorded his video for proof, but his license plate is not in the video. I also don’t know his full legal name - just his last name. 

It boils my blood that he would drive at such high speeds with other people on the highway WHILE using one hand recording himself driving. You can clearly see where he is due to the highway signs, and his speedometer is also visible. It’s clear he was legitimately going a 170 mph based on not just the speedometer but also how fast he was passing other drivers, so there’s no way he can deny speeding. 

Is there anything I can do with the video to make sure he’s held accountable? He should not have a license, period."
83,"Neighbor gave my allergic child peanut butter. Who is responsible for the medical bills, suffering, etc? (TX)","My daughter (6) went to my friend/neighbor’s house with some kids from the neighborhood. At some point, the group of kids moved to a different neighbors house to swim. I know the parents at the first house well, but never met the parents at the second house.

My daughter is allergic to peanuts and wears a medic alert bracelet that explains as much. Regardless, the mother at the second house served peanut butter sandwiches for lunch.

After my daughter had an allergic reaction, my daughter told the mother about her allergy. The mother did not check the medic alert bracelet for instructions or for my phone number. She did not ask my daughter for my phone number or address Instead, she just called 911. No one came to find me.

By the time I found out what was happening, my daughter was already in an ambulance on her way to the hospital. The mom who called the ambulance did not even ask the EMTs which hospital they were heading to.

The medical bills are outrageous. I asked the mother who served my daughter peanut butter to cover the ambulance and ER bills and she flat out refused. 

Can I sue them for my medical bills? What about emotional distress? None of the other families in the neighborhood are willing to have my daughter over for a play date, which upsets her greatly. We may have to move, which will be very expensive."
84,Mother of my children has been saving all of paid child support,"(She is in PA, I’m in Florida.) So far I’ve been paying my ex child support for two years. Visiting my kids she told me that she has been saving up the child support to try and afford a better place to live. She also confided in me that she plans on using the child support for her upcoming car payment. I found this disturbing as my kids lacked summer clothes and she insisted I stock her place with groceries during my visit. To make matter 100X worse she allegedly got a dui. Her saving the child support is disgusting on its own but I’m afraid these funds might go to pay off this new legal matter she has on her hand. What should I do to protect myself and my kids."

When I was leaving for the day on Friday I heard the dispatchers talking shit about my name and one of them said ""you should see his license number"" like wtf does that mean? Well anyway I tried to play it off as part of the joke but over the weekend it constantly bugged the crap out of me. I called out yesterday and today I don't even feel like showing up, it's bothering me THAT bad. I don't know if there's really even anything I can do and maybe I'm overreacting but I'm just so baffled how a company can be so immature about my name when I'm standing right fucking there.

I have a very minor criminal record with charges that don’t even exist in the United States for freedom of speech purposes, but I simply just don’t want to share my past, not because I have something to hide but because I am what I want to hide... I don’t plan on doing this anytime soon, probably in 5 years but what would I need?

88,"my state is trying to say I can't run for office because I haven't voted in 2 years, is this legal?","I'm trying to run for mayor of my local town, I registered as a Republican and tried to contact the republican party to get their approval but I Never heard back from them (It's not strictly required to get consent to run as a republican but they can contest my candidacy if they don't want to work with me).
A law that was put in place in 2021 says if I haven't voted in any primary elections for the past 2 years then I'm not allowed to run for any kind of office in the state of Indiana.
I'm pretty sure this shouldn't be legal under federal or constitutional law, but I figured I'd get some advice since I'm being taken to court in Indianapolis for just trying to run for office for the 1st time."
89,deposited someone else's check,"About a month ago I got a check from a payroll company working with my employer, but they sent me someone else's check. I didn't realize it was someone else's until I deposited it and I was wondering if I had any legal obligation to send the money back. Ive been in contact with them and they've sent me two letters politely asking me to send back the money they sent me (they sent me an envelope with their address but didn't give me a stamp which I found annoying, since it was their fault and now its my problem), but basically Im just wondering if I have any legal obligation to pay them back. It was a one time payment so they cant deduct it from my future checks since I won't be getting any.

Edit: I know that since Im aware of it now, I cant claim that I was unaware of it after the fact. But im wondering if my lack of intent + the companies lack of giving me a reasonable way to pay them back (They didn't send me a stamp & demanded a check, which I do not have and have to now set that up with my bank) could be a way to avoid paying them back and avoid any type of liability"
90,6 driving under suspensions with 3 pending. Seeking advice,"Hello all and welcome to my post. Which of coarse you are able to see why I created…

 Six, count them SIX times I have been pulled over for driving without a license within the past decade. Please, before you leave, allow me to dig in to what I hope serves for good entertainment if not helpful advice on my end. 

TO BEGIN!!! I am 31 years old, a father of one but a father to three beautiful boys ages 15 12 and 4 months. Along with their STUNNING mother, they create what matter most to me in life. They have opened my eyes to behold a deeper meaning in life and allowed me the opportunity to grow and develop into the man I never thought I could be…Spoiler alert:I’m an ex-junky 🤪 prolly walked around looking like this half the time 

Yes folks, you heard it true, from the ripe budding age of 12 I began to experiment with narcotics and soon developed into full on addiction. From 12 years of age to 29 years of age I fought. Sometimes we’ll, sometimes poorly. Sometimes I won, sometimes I put myself right back where I started. Always as a result of my own decisions. The addiction had its say and still does to this day, but I no longer feed its punk self what it wants. I learned that it stays much much quieter when I feed it what it hates. Love. Commitment. Humility. Integrity. Compassion. 
Well, during my addiction, or rather a period of sobriety, I managed to put my life on track. Left prison and cleaned up. Started a landscaping and lawn care company and was on my way! On my way to a speeding ticket which I received for speeding 15 mikes over. It was Sunday, I was with my (then) lady, and we were garage sailing. Big hill. Cop at the bottom, we’ve all been there. So he pulls me over, I get a ticket, i go to the hearing and am found guilty. I get a letter in the mail requesting my presence for a special point hearing. I had 6 points on my license and had just gotten it back the previous year. The points examiner recommended I apply for a work license and pay a huge fee. I obliged. I owned a company which required me to drive, of coarse I paid it. Well they denied me and I never received the memo. Maybe they sent it, maybe they didn’t. Maybe the post office worked at it, who knows? All I know is that I received a driving under suspension in the mail a few months later after I applied for this employment license which I thought I got. Shouldn’t have thought. Anyway here comes another dus. And a short time later I relapse. Getting pulled over 4 additional times as I stopped paying my insurance registration etc, but still drove to get drugs. IDIOT. I swear y’all just typing this makes me furious at myself!!!

But I digress. Fast forward a few years and I meet the love of my life, TWICE! My beautiful wife and out beautiful son! Unfortunately for us, we already had reserved our love for drugs and soon both landed back in prison Kyle, back with his great grandparents. I felt pain like never before. I felt my heart wrench and tear in two at the thought of the depth and reach of my latest failure. We swore we would make a change, we swore this would never happen again, we both, individually hardened ourselves and then created a plan. And paroled out swinging! 

Myself in February of 2019 and her in May of the same year! 

Since we’ve been released we have ROCKED IT! We started in a tiny one bedroom apartment and now live in a beautiful 3 bedroom! Which we have filled with laughing young ones (and a moody but lovable teenage one). We regained custody of Amanda’s son and then took guardianship over his cousin whom is experiencing the same terrible childhood as Kyle suffered through. How could we not?? I tell ya, between those two and our newest member to the family, my life is about perfect!

EXCEPT THAT I DON’T HAVE A LICENSE. 

I was pulled over leaving work last November. Legal vehicle, ran my plate. Pulled me over. 

No big deal. Just be more safe right?
No option for public transportation. 
No family to give rides.
Uber?!? You must be kidding. I would have to work to pay my Uber bill. I’m not joking. 
The bottom line is that I searched for any way around continuing to drive. I couldn’t find any. 
I actually put my car up for a month and forced myself not to drive. 3 and a half weeks in my son got SICK SICK. I drove to the store where I paid in change for knock off medicine. I couldn’t even afford ginger ale to soothe his stomach. I had never felt so low in my life. I couldn’t pay our bills where I was currently working and it was the ONLY PLACE I COULD WALK TO. Had I not promised God and myself that I would never take what wasn’t mine again I would have robbed that store for every last think I could think of to make my boy feel better. My needs were increasing. Amanda was growing and our new born was coming. 

I hopped my ass back in that drivers seat! 

I then drove. And drove. And drove. And drove.

I drove to work. To therapy. To my psychologist. To baby appointments. To take my wife to work because she also does not have a license but is under dui suspension so can’t risk going straight to jail. To anywhere you can imagine a normal family of 5 plus kitties and doggies would REQUIRE to go. I created a NEW company and although we found no shortage of adversity, we powered through!! 
And then the last two weeks happened. 
Pulled over in after leaving our pediatrician. How could I have forgotten the inspection 😢 
Pulled over 4 days later on the way to work at 230 AM. Why the fuck is my tail light broken. 
Pulled over a few days later on my way to get the parts the car needed to take to the mechanic. And by a cop whom I have a history with from my hometown. How can this be happening, I’m so efed. 
And finally today. Regular Tuesday, I work 40 hours from Friday to Sunday and my wife works four tens Monday through Friday. We can’t afford childcare so we eliminated our need for it. We’re struggling but making it work and still so deeply in love that every day is a gift! Every struggle only a pending victory!! Our baby boy begins screaming. Bloody. Murder. I have never heard him sound like this and over the coarse of the next half hour watched his go back and forth from completely fine to blood curdling screams with tears. I finally got ahold of my wife and decided to go pick her up early and go to the dr. Our son has quieted some while in the car but was still crying loudly. Before I had left the house I had to make a decision. Drive my inspected truck which is horribly unsafe for my baby as it’s a single cab or drive the uninspected Honda and have my sons ride in the back to try and soothe the baby. And of coarse, I get pulled over for my inspection. 

Without going too much into detail, I’m losing it. I’m not losing my recovery, f that. I’m losing my mind. All I want to do is love and care and provide for my family and I’m fully aware I’m in the wrong. I still drove BUT WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!

Every time I get pulled over I explain my position to the officer. I’m honest. I don’t lie. And I always ask their advice. You want to know what I get? What absolute gems have been dropped on me? “Well, ya got to just get through it”
“Call your legislature”
“Why don’t you use public transport? No bus line? Uber then”
I have gotten a whole lot of “sorry that sucks” I don’t want sympathy, I want to not be sent to jail for striving every single day to improve myself and mt families position in life. My kids deserve so so so much more than I can give them but for the love of God I can’t even take one of them to the doctor without worrying I may be pulled over. It’s affects them and it’s so wrong. 
Whatttttt dooooo i doooooooo?"
91,Can I sue someone who lied to the police to get charges pressed against me?,"I'm sick of taking the high road and this has really ruined my life. I also want to know if I can press charges/sue the police but it's a rich town and I know that could come back around to bite me in the ass. I suffered a second psychotic breakdown (the woman in question caused the first one) due to the stress of the court case and became an alcoholic again. 

Also curious to if I can press charges for cyber bullying and cyber harassment without having any proof? The messages are all gone and they were cryptic and ambiguous but very specific at first."
92,Left handed class action?,"So I Know this seems kind of ridiculous to a lot of people and I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. I believe that left handed people are being systematically oppressed. Just for a quick example, All throughout high school there was one left handed desk in the entire building. In gym class I was always told to just learn it right handed. Left handedness has been linked with depression, higher suicide rates, schizophrenia and more. I just learned that the scientific term for it is 'non-righthandedness'. It is a fact that the majority of machinery and tools are made for right handed people and left handed equivalents are expensive, or unavailable altogether. I think that there's a lot more that we don't even think about that subconsciously teaches left handed people that they are wrong for being left handed. Would there be any case here or is this completely dismissible?

93,Prenup in New York,"I am set to marry my fiancee a year and a half from now.

At some point in the future, I will inherit <800 thousand dollars mostly in stock equities, two Airbnb's, and 7 rental properties with around 600 dollars in average net monthly income from each.

I mentioned that I wanted a prenup that ensures that my inheritances and my income from them remain separate during our marriage and that they would only pass down to my children if I die but she completely disagreed. I said that this means I won't be using any of my inheritance assets on joint purchases like a house but she didn't like that either.

Is there any other way to ensure that my inheritances and my income from them will remain separate and only pass down to my children without her agreeing to a prenup?

If not, I'm probably not going to marry her as I think it is completely unreasonable for her to disagree with something like this and I don't want to risk losing my dad's life's work."
94,What happens if you shoot someone who didn't think you would shoot him if he touched you?,"If you are throwing a little party somewhere outside, you have the sound speakers in your car for the music, then someone goes to look at your equipment in the car so you take out your gun and tell him to get away from the car but he starts acting touch and thinks you wont shoot him so he steps closer to you and wants to take your gun away from you so you have no other choice but to shoot him.. and theres lots of witnesses to what happened. I don't feel the killer is guilty in this case but I'm sure he would go to prison for this right?

95,"How do I [32M] as a manager deal with employee [38M] who wants to wear kilt in work, claiming ""cultural reasons"" and ""discrimination"" if I don't let him. Not sure what to do. What do you advise? [London, England]","I'm a manager, been in my new job for 3 months now. On Tuesday, Simon, one of the guys I work with, asked to talk to me in private.

I thought, oh, it's probably about hours, or other mundane stuff. But, no, itwas far worse.

He said to me thathe claimed he had the right to wear a kilt to work and bring bagpipes infor cultural reasons, said ""oh, but you let that Indian guy wear a turban on his head, and that woman wears a headcovering, but she's a Muslim, in't she? Surely I can wear a kilt and bagpipes with a dagger, then?"" He then said ""It's discrimination you not letting me wear this, besides, hoots mon, you' gotta let me do this to work.""

However, our official work regulations don't permit men to wear skirts, and I wonder if his grounds are flimsy, or if he's just making a point.

Me and Simon have clashed on other issues before, such as him chatting to guildmates on Worldofwarcraft online in work hours, from our computers, and I've also seen an employee (not Simon) putting his hand up a woman's skirt (which the woman actually wanted, CCTV evidence proved it, I believe she said ""Put ya hand up my skirt, you know you want to, it's hot, turns me on"". I actually was there at the time and saw it, was disgusted, but that was a year ago).

I feel like going to the boss about this, but don't know how to handle it, this is my first real management role (aside from, maybe, when I was a student, managing meetings, but then again, that was years ago when I was only 18).

The boss is the boss of the whole company, I'm the next one down the management chain, so to speak, it's just him, then me, and the employees, in our office.

I work here in London, and have been at my current job for over 6 years now, anyway, apart from this, I enjoy my job, it's just this issue I have to deal with.

96,Problem Male Employee wearing open toed shoes to work,"Hi guys.

I am the owner of a small company (30 people ish) and we don’t have an in house HR.

We have a problem male employee who has started wearing open toed shoes to work for whatever reason, I don’t know. But his feet are disgusting and it grosses people out.

We have a dress code for men and women. Women are allowed to wear open toed shoes so long as they are an appropriate color and design.

For men The requirement is closed toed shoes - period.

Yet this employee has decided to protest his imagined “gender discrimination” and his given reason for this is that he is too hot in our office and that his feet need to breath. Which is disgusting because he has nasty man feet with hair and discolored toenails and dead skin.

I have asked him three times now- first over the phone, second in person and third in email - but he refuses to change his mind and continues to wear the shoes. He is also going around telling employees that we can’t make him dress appropriately with shoes and that he has every legal right to wear them and if we fire him he will sue us.

I’m thinking that I can probably have building security deny him access to our office but I’m not sure it that is the best way to go about forcing him to step down off his ridiculous soapbox.

Does anyone have any advice or input here? Myself and the other female coworkers in particular are extremely grossed out by the sign of his feet and my female employees (about 85% of the company are women) are started to throw around the dreaded “hostile work environment” phrase.

What can I do?!?!

98,Was I Sexually Harassed?,"21 year old male working as a pizza delivery driver in Vermont for a local business. 

&#x200B;

When I was hired at the end of this past summer to this job, a manager added me to a group text with all the other delivery drivers and the manager so that if people needed to have their shift covered they could ask in the group text. Yesterday, there were two drivers coordinating a shift switch and I asked them in the chat if they could take their conversation off the group chat and just message each other directly so that everyone's phones wouldn't keep going off. One of my coworkers sent a message in the group text that was directed at me that said ""can we have a rule where you you take your butt plug out and put it in your mouth for an hour or 2?"" (his grammar errors not mine). Someone else added a laugh emote to that message. The manager is still apart of this group text and I believe they can see these texts. So far the manager hasn't said anything to me or in the group text about this message. Today I sent a message in the group text that what he said to me was out of line and he replied that I should stop crying. He later sent me a personal message saying that he didn't mean what he said and was just goofing around.

It is getting to that point in the week where we have to write down our hours of availability so that we can be put on the schedule to work next week but I don't really want to go back to work if I'm going to be talked to like that and not have the leadership do anything to stop it. We don't have an official HR from what I can tell because the business only has roughly 20-30 employees from what I have seen.

I am not really sure what to do in this situations because I love my job because it pays so well and don't want to lose it because of this. This is the first time anything of this nature has been directed at me at this job. Should I just man up and forget the whole thing? Is it worth reporting what I think is sexual harassment if it only happened once? Should I contact an attorney? What steps do I need to take in all of this?"

100,"Ex said she's going to sue for slander, how worried should I be (nc)","I met this girl on an app in October. We went on a few dates and since then she's come to my place once a week or so and we hung out and all that. I was really into her but also really busy with school so I didn't have time to hang out with her as much as she wanted.

We were hanging out and she went to the bathroom and left her phone on the sofa. It buzzed and I looked at it and saw a text from another guy. I opened the message and screenshotted the conversation and sent it to myself. I wanted it as evidence for when I confronted her. When I did, she said we weren't exclusive so she could talk to whoever she wanted. I said she shouldn't be texting other guys in my house, it's disrespectful. She told me she didn't text him, he texted her and she couldn't control hen he texted her. She left and ignored all my texts and calls after.

I was really pissed about the whole thing. I was kind of blinded by my emotions and unthinkingly posted the screenshot on facebook and tagged her. In the post, she was referred to as a cheater. She untagged herself pretty quickly and the post was removed. However, I heard through a mutual friend that she may have lost a job offer at a political agency because of it, though I don't know if this is true. I lost a lot of friends over this post and a lot of people took her side. I'm pretty emotionally wrecked by the whole thing. I really liked her and thought we'd be good together, and now I not only lost her, but a bunch of people hate me.

She hasn't spoken to me, but someone gave me a heads up that she's going to sue me for slander. I am wondering if I should get a lawyer or send a cease and desist to stop talking badly about me to my friends. I would just like this situation to go away. "

Need to know what the fallout could be.,"Due to reasons I am unable to share and believe me, this is the worst struggle of my life, I am having to put an option on the table that I never thought I would have to consider. I am not asking, nor want to discuss the ethics of considering such decision. I struggle enough with that already. Please respect this request and consider only adding to the conversation directly responding to the questions.

I am reaching the end of my rope and am unable to co-parent my child of 6 with my out-for-revenge-ex spouse, making my life a living hell, every single day, just for his/her amusement. One day I am going to snap and I will end up in jail, or one day, he/she will be successful in one of his/her attempts to  entrap me and I will end up in jail. Either way, it is a shitty situation, and I need to be as far away as I can from my ex. I am a victim of severe emotional abuse.

Question: assume I moved overseas...tomorrow? Next week?  and moved to a small town in EU? Anywhere. What are the legal consequences of me leaving my child behind, unannounced. (US Citizen, able to get residency anywhere in EU).

\- The divorce process left me broke, with next nothing and assigned most of our assets to her, so I know he/she wont have trouble supporting him/herself and our child. I still intend to keep paying my child support obligations, but I am concerned that salaries in EU are far lower than in the US and I may not be able to pay the full amount, especially if now he/she will have 100% of the custody.

\- I  also know that most EU countries offer reciprocal child support enforcement laws that can be enforced upon their residents. How much are these treaties enforced?

\- Can he/she go to court and say I abandoned my child without notification and strip me of my rights to see him/her again till my child is 18 years old? Can he/she change his/her name, so I am unable to track him/her, once he/she is an adult?

\- If I do leave without obtaining a mutually agreed up on plan and court approved parenting plan beforehand, what are the legal ramifications?

\- Will I have rights to visitation? Even if I ""abandoned"" him/her? I understand the courts (and the world) would not look kindly on such action (and only the few who have been victims of NPD abuse, could understand)

\- Have other's done this? Is there a checklist of steps to take?

\- I don't know what else to ask, as I have just begun to consider this, but it is starting to seem as my only way out. What else should I take into account?  I do not want to break the law, and definitively do not want to be some sort of fugitive nor wanted by authorities.

\- Do I need to find a Saul Goodman?  A lawyer of his caliber? Anyone know of one? I need a bad ass lawyer to answer so many more questions I have.

I am scared and do not know what to do. I feel disgusted by even asking this question, but I must have it ready as an option.

102,I hate my adult children. What can I do to draft a will that will be so convoluted they will have to fight one another in court after I die?,"I'm relatively wealthy (~$500K in savings and stock plus my house) but looking back on life, maybe I spent too much time at work and not enough time raising my sons properly. 

We do not get along at all. They are entitled, rude, and haven't made anything of themselves because they expect to inherit everything from me. 

I've had enough of them and I want to teach them a lesson after I die. Unfortunately I've talked to a couple lawyers and none of them have agreed to help me so I'm looking online. 

I want to create a will (or a couple of wills) so convoluted that my sons have to fight one another to inherit anything. 

My thoughts so far are that I prepare two wills and date them the same day. One will would give almost everything to one son, while the other will would give almost everything to the other son. I'd also tell one son about the will but then act really loopy and confused around the other so he would think I'm not in a right state of mind. 

My sons already don't like one another and I know they would fight each other to the death to get my money. What else can I do to make as expensive and difficult a challenge as possible? I'm in Illinois. "

104,I (25M) made 1.4 Million in stocks with my parents (51F and 49M) and now they don't want to share as promised. What do I do?,"Was referred here from r/relationship_advice

&#x200B;

Since a young age, I was highly interested in finances, making money and being successful in general. I would read books about those topics and watch a ton of videos on YouTube. After graduating from high school, I decided to join a private university in Germany and major in international business and marketing. Whilst my parents are doing financially fine because of our family business, they are not rich by any means. Nevertheless, they paid for my education in full and didn't hesitate to do so and support me, something I am genuinely grateful for.

Because the university is private and costly, a big part of the students were children of wealthy people in the city and had expensive cars and clothes (New Mercedes, Gucci, etc.). That made me kind of unhappy, that I wasn't a part of them, but also highly motivated me to do something about my personal financial situation even as a student. At the end of my first semester, I decided to start investing, as I already knew quite a bit about the topic. My plan was to expand my knowledge In a period of six months, and then invest my money that I had saved up by working in our family business.

Six months later, after many books, talks with professors and a lot of research, I still felt a bit uneasy but also capable and decided to pull the trigger and invest. I invested 7k (all my savings) in Tesla stock, this was around the beginning of Covid when the stocks had already plummeted. It was very existing and a special moment for me, but the best part was that shortly after investing that 7k, I started making money from it. The account was growing superfast, and I was on cloud nine.

That's when I decided to talk to my parents and ask them for a loan, so I could invest more money. I prepared a presentation and made everything super professional, as if I was applying for a CEO position and after our talk, they decided to lend me 10k. I accepted the money and put it in my account. Soon after, the money was rising again and they were pleased. Over the next months, my parents gave me 80k in separate installments for me to invest.

After the portfolio grew quite a bit, and the results were solid, we talked one more time, and they offered to give me 115k more (all of their savings). I invested the money.

Here is where the problems start: One of my mentors/ professors from my uni whom I am very close to knew what I was doing and was super proud of me. He would advise me on the topic and guide me through the processes, as he was an investor as well, and a wealthy guy. Early on, he advised me to be careful, as money can change people and the typical stuff you hear from rich guys...to simplify, he wanted me to have guidelines with my parents. Who does what and who gets how much after? Because they are my parents, I never did that. After they gave me the last installment of 115k and this huge responsibility, I started to feel that maybe I should talk to them. We scheduled an appointment, but my dad couldn't come, so my mom and I talked about my concerns. I told her that because I do all the work and the research (which is daily until now) and they provided the financials, we should split 50% for my parents and 50% for me. That's what my mentor advised me and honestly that's what, I felt, was fair too, since it is a lot of work on the daily and very, very stressful. My mom got very uncomfortable, but agreed to it. I told her that I don't want to fight with them in the future, as this was a blessing to the family and me too.

Since then, my account grew to 1.4mil before the Ukraine Russian war and is about 650k right now, slowly recovering.

Last night, things changed. I was at my parent's house, and we were discussing some family stuff and having a good time. My mom decided to drive me home, as my car was at the mechanic. During the drive, she was silent and not very talkative, which she usually is. I asked her if something was wrong, and she answered that all is fine. Literally 5 seconds later she asked me what my plans were with the money, when I decide to sell one day (plan to sell for around 4/5 mil). The moment I started talking about my plans (buying a home, nice car, new investments) she started laughing and telling me how there is no way I will be able to afford this stuff with my part of the money. When I asked her how much she thought I would get, her answer was 100k. I was shocked, but I assumed she was joking, and then she went on this rant of explaining to me how me, my sis and my brother would all get 100k each (my siblings had nothing to do with this and my sis also explicitly refused to be a part of the investing because it is so risky). My hearth dropped, and I felt played because of all this hard work and expectations for \*just\* this? After all, I am planing to sell at least at 4mil. We got into a fight and I asked her to stop the car and leave me in the middle of nowhere. From there I walked home a few kilometers in the dark and couldn't breathe all the way through. I was mad, sad, hysterical for a moment even...

Besides the fact that this is an accomplishment not many are proud of, and I achieved at such a young age, it has always been my dream to make a lot of money. Now all of that hard work and emotions over years for them to f me over? My mom did agree to splitting the money 50/50 early on, even though my dad was not a part of that conversation. She even guaranteed it. Moreover, there is no way I could ever look them in the eyes if they do that to me. We haven't talked since yesterday and I think a contestation will follow soon, but I don't know what to do...

Do I get a lawyer?? I don't want to sue my parents, but we also do not have a contract. Do I talk to them as an adult and try to understand them and find a resolution? Just swallow it? What do I do?

I can't talk to my mentor, as I feel like I will absolutely disappoint him with my decision to go against his experienced opinion.

Most important for me is my family of course, I don't want to fight with the over money or even lose them but definitely felt stabbed in the hearth yesterday.

Your suggestions are highly appreciated.

TL;DR Made over a million in stocks during covid with my parents, now they don't want to share as promised."
105,"Urgent help needed over incident today at a grocery store, involving Concealment/Shoplifting","Location: Walmart
State: Commonwealth of Virginia 
Charge: Larceny: Shoplifting <200 - Concealed Merchandise
Law section:18.2-103
Accused crime: Intent to shoplift

Story: 

Today at Wal-Mart, my S.O and myself were detained by 3 police officers including the Sheriff of our city. The reason being was Concealment. However, we were each under the belief that Shoplifting couldn't occur until you leave the store with unpaid items in your possession. 

We were within Walmart and had each concealed minor value items, my S.O putting her items in her purse while shopping with a cart and filling that up as well with good items, etc. 

Along our way we realized we were being watched very closely by a plainclothes loss prevention employee, who followed us so closely we thought we were going to get pickpocketed. We asked her multiple times who she was and what she was doing, and she just picked up the phone, ignoring us both. 

We overhead her on the call describing what each of us were wearing and what we were currently doing within the premise. We panicked, ditched all the concealed items,of which the plainclothes employee saw us do so. 

We then proceeded to walk out of the Walmart, only to be followed by her and one other male employee. As we were making our way to the car, a police officer rolled up directly in front of us and stopped, told us we were being detained, asked to search S.O's purse,found no valuables, asked to search myself, I denied the search and they continued on. 

Cited us each with ""probable cause"" even without viewing the security cameras. Was literally the plainclothes employee word vs our own, and I made sure to let the cops know that the employee never made it known who she was. I told the police officers that it caused us fear because she could have been describing us to a assailant to then have us robbed within the store or in the parking lot. He asked me if she ever stated who she was btw.

It was a dumb mistake, and we never had intent of taking anything outside the store. We were taking her elderly godmother shopping and wanted to surprise her with gifts, so we concealed her presents by hiding them on our persons and in a purse. 

To make matters worse, my S.O is currently at the end of her probation status and if she catches a charge now, it's pretty much game over for her freedom right now. We feel remorseful and know that we shouldn't have, but never intended to steal and thought that in our panic to evade the creeper of a Loss Prevention employee, that ditching the items and leaving would set us in the clear. 

Had no clue about this law, sounds like a bullshit bogus one. We will be contacting criminal attorneys tmrw(S.O has already contacted her family lawyers after the incident), but in the meantime am trying to figure out a way out, or to get the cases thrown out. Since legally, technically, no actual Shoplifting was committed. They just believe we had intent to shoplift. 

Tldr: both of us got bs misdemeanor ""Concealing merchandise"" in Walmart today. Banned from that walmart,had to sign trespassing papers. Commonwealth of VA, no items were actually ever stolen, and it was written up under ""General District Court (Traffic), if that matters at all. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated. Thank you"
106,Got caught at target in USA,"My girlfriend got caught stealing from target, she skipped scanning an item and was confronted by 2 security personnel. She was entirely compliant with everything and even let them search her purse for any other merchandise (she paid for a total of about $50 items and skipped a $10 item) which they didn’t find anything. The security folks decided to give her a break and just banned her from the store for a year, and didn’t call the police. She’s done it once or twice before with items under $10 and hasn’t been caught. She realizes she made a mistake and is probably never going back to any target ever again. She has severe anxiety and is convinced she’s going to be arrested later and charged. Are they going to investigate her further or anything?"

108,My brothers Ex-wife not changing her last name back and she has a child that isnt his,"In the divorce agreement it stated she had to change it back to her maiden name. It’s been 3 years and she still hasn’t. We found out that she has a child and the father isn’t in the picture so the child’s legal last name is ours. Well our last name isn’t a very common one or at least the way it’s spelled isn’t. My brother is just done at this point and doesn’t want to deal with it. Is there anyway that I could sue her to make her change her and the baby’s last name?

Edit: my main concern isn’t with her having the last name it’s her child and any future possible children she may have having the last name, she is the exact type of person to try and sue us over some stupid bullshit involving the child’s last name being the same as ours. She’s already tried to sue my brother over something which was later thrown out. Idk what he won’t talk about it."
109,We've all joked about it... Jump in the way of a car so you can sue... LOL.. not.,"This has actually happened to me. Except for the part where this woman wasn't even hit.

This whole case has been insane. My life as a very young adult is up in flames, my leasing agent even went as far as to call me ""a baby"". I've even lost my apartment over this, only being given three days to move out. I know we've all joked about it, file a lawsuit after an injury from a vehicular accident. Well someone is pressing me with third degree criminal charges over this exact scenario and I'm now fighting for my life. About a month ago I parked in a car port spot at my complex, not mine, only meaning to be there for two hours. By the time I came out with my friend this woman threatened to have me arrested, towed, thrown in jail, etc. all the while swearing and yelling. She stood on the opposite side of the car port from where I parked and was entering my vehicle. I told her, ""Look I've never seen anyone park here, you don't have to be so rude and I hope your day gets better b\*tch"". I reversed and left as WE watched her walk away.

Two days later I'm called into the police department to make a statement and the Detective told me she wanted an apology and for me to pay her medical bills, taking her side claiming I hit her causing a sprained ankle and swollen knees. I've actually found out since then, that she had these injuries two months ago from a workplace injury. She had gotten a lawyer, changed her mind and wants to press charges. My apartment complex received word from the police department and decided to give me a three day notice to quit. Keep in mind I haven't been officially charged or even been to court yet, this is all done on hearsay. The injuries had also escalated to a broken foot and sprains in both knees. 

So now I'm technically homeless and get this. I was mailed from the court's office a notice that my hearing date had changed but because I was evicted I don't have access to my mail, so I would have never known this and potentially had a warrant out for my arrest because of this. The only way I found out was also a joke as I've been trying to get a public pretender which is near impossible to do especially if you are employed. Remember I'm a young adult, homeless have $0.22 to my name and I'm on an LOA from work due to the extreme stress this whole thing has caused. She's also claiming to have someone whom saw me hit her.

Our justice system is broken. If anyone has any advice on the matter, please let me know, I need all the help I can get right now. I've tried to see if this has actually happened to anyone else and it honestly doesn't seem like it has."
110,Document for person to consent to sex,M24 - looking for a legal document to protect myself for my sexual partners to sign that consents to them having sex with me and that they are 18+. Does this exist in the united states?
111,"[New York, NY] Against my express consent, parents insist on leaving 100s of thousands, if not millions of dollars to my 4 year old in a trust","My parents set up a trust for my daughter against my express wishes. I don’t know what the terms are. They refused to make me the trustee. I shared with them my concerns that my daughter is only 4 years old, and I have no idea what kind of person she may be when she gets older and that I’m uncomfortable with her being given large sums of money without my permission and/or involvement. This isn’t chump change. My parents are dumping sums to the tune of 100s of thousands of dollars per year in this trust for her. In the end it will hold well over a million dollars, if not several million, and possibly some real estate, as well, although they say that will be left to me and my brother. 

They agreed to not tell her about the trust until she’s “older”, but that doesn’t bring me any comfort because A. I don’t trust they’ll keep their word. They’re narcissistic and will want to be “thanked” at some point and B. It still doesn’t answer the question of what kind of things she may spend the money on that may get her into trouble, or simply be wasteful. Frankly, I’m terrified. We’re talking about a hypothetical adult who is still a toddler here! I also don’t like that they’re going over my head and giving what should be my carefully considered and loving parenting decision over to a perfect stranger who will exercise his judgement against whatever it is my daughter might eventually ask for the money for without even knowing her. I’m her mother, not my parents, and not some random trustee. That and other family dynamics are really neither here nor there. 

I want to know if there’s any action I can bring to dissolve this trust, or clauses (what-have-you) that I can impose that can make the execution/distribution of the trust contingent upon certain things as the parent to this now-child and the adult she will grow to be. 

Edit: I understand (grudgingly) that’s there’s nothing I can do about when she’s an adult and wants to access the trust, but can I have any control over when she discovers there is a trust? My parents have already verbally agreed to let me decide when to disclose it’s existence, but as I said above, I don’t trust that they’ll do that. Is there any kind of legally binding agreement I can write up to make them keep their word? This sounds ridiculous even to me, but there must be a way to work this angle?"
112,Is this defamation?,I was arrested on probably cause for a crime in 2018 but was never charged. Now a person who heard about the arrest posted to twitter that I committed that crime. Is this defamation per se?
113,My (22) ex girlfriend (20) just filed an abuse protection order on me. I have never been violent towards her or threatened her with violence. Do I have a chance to prove it’s unnecessary or is it almost a sure thing that she’ll get it? Thanks in advance.,"Okay I really need some help. I also apologize in advance for the length. I tried to put as much information as I could. So my ex and I have been on and off since October when she cheated on me. I broke up with her when it happened but still gave her the opportunity to explain herself and say what she had to say. I was devastated because I seriously loved the heck out of this girl and never felt like that with anyone else before. So a little time passes and I forgive her and we give things another go. Except right after the first time we slept together again she found out she had herpes and confronted the guy she cheated with and he denied having it. So of course she questions me and I never had symptoms or anything but still went to the doctors and had to explain everything which was terrible but the doctor told me if I never had any symptoms before it was highly unlikely from me. But still I had guilt and felt like I had given it to her. Except the guy finally admitted to it after saying he’d go and get checked. 

She had originally met the guy at school orientation I believe because they were both orientation leaders and they spent two consecutive weeks together and she broke up with me late June of last year when she went for it. Then a week after she gets back home she breaks up with him and comes back to me. So things were great from then on until October, until she cheated. We got past it and fast forward to June of this year when she has to go back again. She started acting very distant and she sent me 3 snapchats with him in them her very first day which just made me feel terrible. I told her that if she was planning to do the same thing she did last year then just be straight up with me and tell me if she’s talking to him behind my back so I can walk away before I get too reinvested again since she had just broken up with me and gotten back just weeks before. 

I dealt with super heavy depression every time she broke up with me and it was like every time I started to find my happiness without her again she’d come back and tell me how much she loved me. So she was telling me that it was nothing and I had nothing to worry about but it was like 9pm and she said she was playing a game with the other leaders and she was “so sorry and would text me in a few” so I waited up for hours but I had work at 6 so I fell asleep. I woke up to see her with a bunch of texts a little after midnight talking about I should be trying to pull her harder and she shouldn’t even be talking to me after all the times I’ve hurt her feelings. She said I shouldn’t be able to tell her not to talk to that guy and I was being controlling for saying that even though I just told her it was either me or him pretty much. So when I woke up at like 4:50am still half asleep I got super emotional and sent her a bunch of texts talking about how she has no idea what it’s like to be hurt considering how depressed I was and wanted to end things for myself at one point which I know is not the answer but I can’t explain how I felt during those times and just wanted it to stop. 

So this is where I fucked up. About a month before I had known a certain family member had kept what I remembered to be a gun in their closet and I was at a low point and grabbed the gun and just sat there crying. I talked myself out of it and really told myself that I had to figure it out because I knew I wanted to live I just wanted the pain to stop. So I took a picture of it so I could remind myself later on in life when I was truly happy and just be thankful that I never did anything. Here’s my biggest mistake, I sent the picture to her just because she tries saying that when I tell her I struggle with that she thinks I’m just lying and trying to manipulate her which I’ve never lied about anything to her. So she didn’t take it well when she woke up and responded because she just started telling me that I was being abusive by sending that and she told her dad and he called me while I was at work and left me a voicemail saying we needed to talk. I started having terrible anxiety at work and I asked my ex/girlfriend why she told her dad and she said  I sent her a pic of a gun so she had to. Then she said she didn’t like me anymore and it was over. I just apologized and tried explaining to her that in no way, shape or form was that meant to hurt, manipulate, scare, threaten her or anything at all. It was me trying to get her to understand what I’ve been through and how badly I’ve been hurting and I still always let her back into my heart after it. She never answered my apologies and I left it at that. 

I think a week later goes by and I see that she was looking at my social media stuff so I sent her a message just telling her how sorry I was again and how much she meant to me and I know I make mistakes but I’ve always been good to her. She told me to leave her alone and she didn’t want to be in a relationship or be friends with me at all. So I asked her if it was because of the picture or something before and she said it was the picture. I just told her how sorry I was again and then I checked out her page and I saw that she had posted a picture of the kid she cheated with only two days after that night and tagged him so I messaged him and honestly did lose my temper and don’t even remember exactly what I said but I definitely told him I wanted to fuck him up and he’s a piece of shit for giving her herpes and I should have talked to him way sooner. I said like let’s meet up sooner than later or something Idek. It takes a lot for me to get angry and lose my cool like that but I was so pissed that I never even called him out months ago and then he came back and was talking to her again. 

So then I messed up again and made an instagram account named “_____WithTheHerpes” and the bio said his school name with his first name and just last initial. I also wrote “I like to sleep with guy’s girlfriends and give the gift that keeps on giving. Yes I have herpes” and I put a generic photo from the internet of a herpes outbreak. Then followed random people from the school including him. So I got a text from her saying “take down that fake profile of _____. If not then I’m going to take this to the police.” I said why so you can be all over Instagram together posting pics and you don’t want people to know the truth? So she blocked me and her dad texted me telling me I was not welcomed anymore at all and they had already sent screenshots of the gun and the Instagram profile to the police and a restraining order was coming my way asap. I responded when the page was down and said please don’t do that because I don’t want anything on my record especially because I graduate this fall and will be applying for jobs. I said I’d never contact his daughter again and I was sorry for everything. The next day I get a call from the police while I was at work to come into the station or they would come to my job or house. I said I would come as soon as I got out of work and I got served an abuse prevention order. I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. 

The court date is one week and I’m scared to talk to my parents or anyone about it for that matter. I have never ever ever threatened or laid a finger on her. Never have I ever thought about and I never would no matter what. Even when she told me she had herpes I was nothing but supporting and told her that it didn’t change who she was and even if I couldn’t be with her again romantically I’d always be there for her with anything. So I’m terrified of what’s to come and don’t know how to prepare for court or if I should get a lawyer or if I should could just prove to the judge that i am no threat to her whatsoever. I have no issue bringing in full pictures of text conversations with context of everything. I in no way threatened her and literally explained right when I sent the picture that I was depressed and wanted to end it for myself. Do I honestly need a lawyer for this? The officers said that things like this happen all the time and I really don’t think that there’s anything that she could say that would make the judge think I’m a threat to her. 


tldr; my ex who cheated on me, got herpes and put me through emotional hell with on and off breakups, started to repeat her past tendencies and I told her how badly it’s hurt me and made me depressed and wanting to end my life. I sent her a picture of the gun I had in my hands at one point which actually turned out to be a very real looking BB gun but explained that it had nothing to do with her directly and just some suicidal thoughts I had. I literally told her if she planned on talking to the same guy that did this to us then I just be straightforward and tell me before I let my guard down and fall back into depression. She tells me she doesn’t want anything to do with me and I just apologized and left it at that for a week. Then I messaged her apologizing again and telling her how much I missed her but she said she didn’t want to be friends or anything anymore. So I messaged that guy and went off on him saying how I was gonna fuck him him up and I should’ve a long time ago. And he’s a piece of shit for everything he’s done. Then I made a fake page called “____WithTheHerpes” but never used his photo or full name. And said “I like to sleep with guy’s girlfriends and give the gift that keeps going. Yes I have herpes” then her dad texted me telling me they sent screenshots of everything to the police and a restraining order is coming. Which they really did file and the hearing is in a week. Do I have any chance of proving to the judge that it’s unnecessary for an abuse protection order and I don’t pose a threat to her or anyone else? I just want this all to be over at this point. I should have moved on a while ago."
114,Am I going to get arrested for unlawful imprisonment? [AR],"I currently am employed as a receptionist at a pregnancy clinic.

Basically, when a woman comes to our clinic, the nurses give her a free pregnancy test and discuss her options. The goal is to advocate for adoption or raising the baby and to provide free resources for the women who agree to one of the two options.

One woman became extremely agitated after beginning her appointment. She started screaming ""IM GOING TO GET AN ABORTION"" so loud that I could hear it at the front desk. The nurse left the woman alone in the room to calm down. The door was locked and the woman tried to open it in her rampage. When it wouldn't open, she called 911. 

The police came in and had us open the door. I asked them to escort the woman out which they did. One of the cops came back in and told me that what ""we"" (I was NOT the one who locked the door) committed unlawful imprisonment and should hear from the police in the next few days.

I want to emphasize that the nurses and I followed company policy to a T through this entire situation. Did we commit a crime, or if a crime was committed, is it the fault of the business? Are any of us liable or is it the business owner? Again, we were following company policy. Thank you."
115,[NV] Ex-lover is mad that I didn't disclose I was transsexual. She is now pressing charges against me and spreading lies about me. Is there something I can do to fight this?,"I'm a post op trans man who transitioned about 4 years ago. Recently I met up with a girl we'll call jen. Jen and me hit it off and decided one night to have sex. During the act Jen all of the sudden got very concerned and stopped before either of us finished. When I asked why she began to harass me about not revealing i'm a ""tranny"" (her words.) While yes, I didn't reveal to her that I was trans, I really didn't think it mattered. I've already transitioned so most people don't care. Well, apparently she did because she left immediately and I haven't seen her since.

SO, to make a long story short she is now pressing charges on me for sexual assault. Her claim is I lied, manipulated, and pressured her into sex and that because she didn't know all the ""facts"" she could not have connected.Along with this, she is now telling all of out mutual friends that I lie to people about who I am to get sex. This is negatively affecting me as I have received some awful messages from people and am not welcome to a lot of places i used to go

Is there anything I can do? I'm meeting with a lawyer tomorrow but I want to know what my options are here going in. Can I sue her for slander and maybe counter sue for false charges? thanks in advance.

116,I am thinking about using service to create job references so I can get a better paying job. What would happen if I get caught?,"I have autism. I have several real degrees, mostly from legitimate online colleges like the University of Phoenix and smaller state schools near where I live.

I have an MBA, a few masters degrees and a BS in a STEM subject.

I’m stuck at minimum wage factory jobs with no hope of advancing.

To get good paying jobs I need experience but I can’t get that experience because all jobs even entry level positions what experience.

I was thinking of using services that would create that experience: things like CareerExcuse, or the reference shop/store

Would these services work? What are the legal implications for using such services? I know it’s morally wrong, but I’m sick of being stuck at minimum wage jobs with no way out, I just wanted to make sure that I couldn’t go to jail for using such services.

Bare in mind that I have legitimate degrees so I’m not asking about buying a fake degree to do a job I don’t know how to do, I’m asking about buying fake experience so I can get a job I already learned how to do in college.

What are the odds of getting caught? Would these job reference services work, or are they scams?

If it did work out and got the job and did good at it, what is the likelihood I’d get discovered and/or fired over it.

After I use the service how long would I need to worry about my ruse being discovered. Bare in mind all the education on my resume will be real, it’s just the previous job experience will be created by a service that created job experience and references and not by working at an actual job.

Is their any legitimate way for a person with autism and poor social skills to get a job w/o needing to buy experience because I can’t seem to find one.

I just want answered about the legal aspects of doing this not the moral or ethical aspects because I stopped caring about morals and ethics along time ago. I just want to make sure that it is not a felony or other legal offense to use these services to land a good paying job."
117,Scammed a Scammer Now He's Threatening to Alert the FBI,"There's a scammer that recently sent me $1000. I blocked him shortly after he sent me the check which I then deposited into my account. I was supposed to send him half of the money back but none of my accounts were working. Plus all of his accounts had different names, even his instagram handle and username had different names. For example, his Cashapp was Bri, Gmail was Paula, and I believe one of his Instagram names was Brandon. Anyways, he emailed me (my business email is in my bio) and is threatening legal action since I took his money. I think I have a pretty fair case if this does happen since he was the one to send me the money and he has a very dubious internet presence. My only issue is I told him I would pay him back which could be used as a contractual agreement in court. In the case of legal action to I have a good case or should I be more concerned?

&#x200B;

Also he did threaten to contact the FBI, but there is a family friend of ours who is an FBI agent. Should I ask him about this as well?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just got off the phone with my bank and informed them that the check I cashed may be fraudulent. The representative said it wasn't or else the sensors would have picked it up or he would notice since he was looking at it. Either I'm lucky or they are wrong, either way I won't be spending the money anytime soon. If/When my bank comes to take the money I can always refer them to the recorded call about the check. Thank you to everybody who has been helping so far, I'm not the brightest bulb in the building so this has been a massive learning experience. "
118,[NC] Liquour store denied me service,"Today was my 21st birthday, so to celebrate, me and some friends went to the ABC store. The cashier looked at my license (which clearly states ""Turns 21 on 08-28-2018"") and asked me what time I was born. I told her I didn't know and that it didn't matter, she said she couldn't properly verify I was 21 yet. I demanded to see a manager, and he said she was right, and told me to leave or he'd call the cops. This is absolute BS. Can I call the police on them and take them to court? It's my birthday!"
119,[WA] Can I take my insulation with me when I sell?,"I am thinking about investing a lot of money insulating my attic. Can I take it with me when I sell my house?

Here is my thought process...

It's purely a matter of business. Nothing else. I'm estimating I could spend up to $5,000 in massive insulation of the attic. All the research I have done says attic insulation is a positive yield investment and the more insulation the higher the return in heating and cooling costs.

The cost to heat a home ranges from $500 to say $2,500 per year. So the payback period on a $5k insulation investment might be between say 2 and 10 years (or longer because heating costs won't go to zero). And I might only stay in the house for about 2 years. (It's a live-in, slow flip.)

So, on one hand, I want to add insulation because it makes the house more efficient to heat and cool. But on the other hand, I might not live in it long enough to get my payback. Also, $5,000 is a chunk of money to leave on the table (by including the insulation in the sale) if I don't have to.

So, I'm thinking if I move the insulation with me to my next house (before I list the existing house and leaving in the minimum amount to meet code—Question for you: what is that amount?) then I (1) retain my $5k investment, (2) make my payback period and (3) have an extra-fully-insulated attic in my next house. Seems like a win-win-win scenario for me. 

The only business reason I can think of not to do it is if it creates a legal liability vis-a-vis the fixtures issue. But who can claim the insulation is a fixture if I remove it before I list the house? In that case, it seems like insulation is not a fixture. Because who, other than I, would ever know it was even there in the first place?

Also, I've never known attic insulation to be a factor one way or the other in the purchase or sale of a house. It's never really come up for me before. I imagine most people share a similar experience. Attic insulation is just not a factor. As long as it meets code.

Is my analysis off base? What are your thoughts?"
120,Help with friend sentenced to prison over picture,"I don't know if there is anything that can even be offered for advice at this point. It doesn't directly concern me. But a friend of mine from work. I'm just gonna post his story. And if you have any advice for this kid please share it. The only thing I can swear to is that in the year that I've known this kid, he's just a good kid. A dorky, nice guy that I really feel like is being shafted right now.

This guy I work with we can call ""J"". When he was 19 he was talking to a girl he met online. Apparently at some point they exchanged pictures. He sent a dick pic to her. Long story short, the girl either lied about her age and she was 16. Her mother found the pic on her phone and was outraged. She went to the police. During this time he lived in Florida. But he had just set up a job in South Carolina and was moving. He told the police and asked him if everything was ok and they said that it was. A year after he moved here the police came and arrested him. This kid by now was 21 (just turned days before). He sat in jail here for a month waiting to go back to Florida. Then he sat in jail in Florida for another 2 months before being given bail.

Since that time he has been back and forth between South Carolina and Florida. Bc of the nature of our jobs (healthcare) he cannot work until this is resolved (which by the time you get to the end of this, may be never). So he lost his job, and bc of the jail time he lost his car and apartment also. The court asked him to see a psychologist for evaluation, which he did. Then they asked him to see another. Every time they asked him to do something else they told him that they were going to dismiss the case, they just had to tie up loose ends. They had him take a polygraph test as well. All of these things this poor kid did. While taking a fast food job bc he couldn't work anywhere else with this going on.

Last week he went back to Florida for another court appointment where this was supposed to be getting settled. And what ended up happening, was that the judge sentenced him to 10 months, 3 of which he's already served. Plus 5 years probation. From what I was told he's not required to register as a sex offender. But that's unclear bc his aunt (that's who gave me the information) said he's not allowed to be around children. Which to me would indicate he would be registered, but she says no. Also this guy is a gaming nerd and apparently. This sentence bars him from being allowed to access the internet.

I'm 45 years old and I've never seen a kid put through this much for doing so little. He was a 19 year old guy who sent a picture to a girl that was 3 years younger than him, and he was under the impression that she was older than she ended up being. I'm not excusing his actions, although I consider them to be extremely minor. I feel like this most likely is going to really hurt his entire life. I don't know if he can ever work at our facility again which sucks. Bc the kid is the hardest working tech that we have.

I don't know why I'm posting this other than that I have on occasion seen some incredible posts from this sub. And I figured that it was worth a shot seeing if anyone had some advice. I have been so upset about this today. I'm a very small time streamer. But once I made affiliate I pledged to help needy gamers for the first two years and all proceeds made by my channel are going to help gamers with crappy situations and this kid was the first person I was able to do something for. With everything going on he was desperate for money. And among the things he had to sacrifice was the GPU from his computer. I used funds from my channel to try to help him out and at least let him get back to doing something that was fun for him. This sentence feels like a slap in my face. I know it isn't. I'm just gutted over it.

What I'm hoping is that someone can maybe offer advice as to where he can go to from here.  He had a jacksonville, florida public defender.  Can he appeal this? Is appealing this worthwhile? I don't know if something like this is a super long shot to win an appeal with and I don't think he will be able to afford much of a lawyer.


Edit: I understand the need to downvote if you have personal feelings towards the situation. But he's my friend. And I just wanna help him. He made a mistake. We work in healthcare at a mental facility for patients that were incompetent to stand trial. I've been mentoring this kid since he moved here and he had a future in healthcare. Something like this will destroy any hope of that. I'm sure you know someone like him. Good kid that just did something dumb. "
121,"[Seattle, WA] Boss is requiring I work on Christmas Day even though the firm is not open then. I said to him I want it as vacation time with family but he insisted no. I'm an employee, and contracted. WTH do I do?","I work in the IT department for a small firm (it sells fashion items) based in Seattle, have worked there since April 2008, and am a full-time employee.

I received a PDF in my email which stated:

> **You are required to work on Christmas Day, 9am-6pm, and this is mandatory.**

> **You will not be paid any extra, not overtime, but will be paid.**

> **All employees are required to bring snacks, foodstuffs into the workplace and female employees must wear a bikini and hotpants or a pink, blue or white swimsuit.**

> **This will be on company social media over the holiday period and you have no choice in participation.**

> **Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action.**

> **Boss's name**


I have retained it as evidence.

I am on a contract, which expires in July 2017 according to current paperwork and am a salaried employee, not a contractor.

The firm I work for does IT-related work.

My contract states I have 12/23, 12/24, 12/25 and the period between Christmas and NYE off. This is a copy of the wording:

> At COMPANYNAME, you have as scheduled vacation:

> 12/23/YEAR - 1/1/YEAR 

> and will be paid for this. 



It doesn't trade on Christmas Day, so why would the boss want me to work these hours?

30/60 co-workers got these emails (there's 60 employees in total) so 50% of the workforce is expected to work on Christmas Day.

The firm employs nearly all women, only 2 men work for the firm (one is in marketing, the other guy works in finance/administration).

The firm is run by one individual, the boss is the highest authority.

I have actually tried complaining to the boss, but she ignored it and said I had no choice. A follow-up email confirmed this in writing (again retained as evidence).

I'm a 43-year-old mom with a 14-year-old daughter, and am married to my husband who is 39.

I don't know whether to get an attorney, or whether I need an attorney-at-law who specialises in employment law.

This clusterfuck of a situation could screw my Christmas up, why would a boss do this to employees?

I can understand EMT workers and cops working at Christmas, but asking 50% of an IT-related company to work Christmas Day?

Can anyone help me with this situation? I really am not sure where to go from here.

I can't just quit due to my contract (worries over livelihood) but I can't work on Christmas Day either due to family obligations, my mom and MIL coming down on same day too.

My endgame in this is to try and ensure I get some satisfaction; I've worked in the job since 2008, it's a job I enjoy and the boss has never requested we work Christmas Day, until now.

Where do I stand legally, and what should my next step be (I've already kept the documentation?)?"

She eventually got a boyfriend and stopped talking to me, and I put the entire thing behind me. It's senior year now and apparently she went crazy sometime last year, got into drugs, got arrested for shoplifting for money to get drugs, and then attempted suicide.

124,I barely survived a 16 hour flight where I went into anaphylactic shock 2 hours into the flight. The crew could not have been more negligent. I am a wondering what the legal counseling could do for me.,"Full story below. It’s a fun one...


I have carried an epi pen for 8 years and have idiopathic anaphylaxis (basically I don’t know what I am deadly allergic to even after numerous, numerous allergy tests). 2 hours into a 16 hour flight from an Asian country to JFK, I broke out in hives just from sitting on an airplane. There was something on that plane that I was allergic to and my throat started to get scratchy. I have almost died in the past from anaphylaxis and have lost consciousness and almost stopped breathing. I immediately informed the flight staff of my allergic reaction, but it seemed like they were stalling to see how my allergic reaction would progress and did not act promptly. This is the kind of thing that can kill a person in an hour if things start to tank. I could not use my epi pens on the flight because that only gives ~30 minutes of protection and that is not a sustainable way to make it through the long flight. I explained this to the staff and also that I was trapped in a plane where I was allergic to something that I did not know and the situation would only get worse and that Benadryl would most likely not get me through the flight and epi pens would stop my heart if I used those injections as the 14 hour solution. I was certain that if I did not land, I would have died as there was no scenario where I saw myself surviving. The flight attendants didn’t give any “real” medical assistance. They called their “doctor” from the cockpit and the treatment that prescribed me to was “a cold compress”. A cold compress is not a solution to anaphylaxis. I demanded to speak to the doctor but was denied as you could only talk to the doctor in the cockpit and no passengers are allowed up there. Flight attendants kept coming up to me and would ask me the same set of useless questions (I was an EMT for 3 years and they were not asking pertinent medical questions, it just seemed like they were stalling). About 4-6 flight attendants did this to me in the span of a critical initial 30 minutes.

Luckily, I made the bold move of relocating myself to the back of the airplane where the flight attendants sit next to the bathroom and I seemed to not be as allergic. The combination of the relocation and the 12 Benadryl I took over 16 hours kept the allergic reaction at bay until I had to go back to my seat for landing. Upon returning to my seat, I broke out in much worse hives, my throat started to close, and I became very dizzy. This was full blown anaphylaxis. I used my epi pen after landing and made sure I was one of the first people off the plane.

If I had complied with that treatment, not made my bold relocation, and had not that much Benadryl (I usually only carry four in my wallet typically), I would have surely died. Without a doubt. It was by luck I made it.

Further, I was awake for 8 hours before the flight, stayed up for the whole 16 hour flight, only to get an epi pen shot at the end (epinephrine is a shot of adrenaline) so i stayed for 8 more hours on top of that for a total of 32 hours. I was jet lagged and very delirious from the 12 Benadryl and lack of sleep (for reference, people are prescribed to take one or two Benadryl at night to help go to sleep) and was the only one providing any lifesaving care to
myself. I also went straight from customs to the hospital and no one helped me from the long walk from the airplane to customs.

Also, I am a US citizen. I live in Massachusetts, and the flight was from somewhere in Asia (I think disclosing the country gives away the airline) to JFK.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I am interested in what legal actions I can take against the airline. Please let me know what the scope of my actions are. Thank you very much!

Addendum below:

Seems like I was very unclear about the doctor situation. I wrote this in one go on my phone, somewhat in anger with the airlines, so this did come out a little clunky.

Below are somethings that I believe I need to clear up:

1.	⁠I saw a doctor prior to the flight and was given a high dosage of steroids (100mg) via injection and also some to carry on board the plane. I was also given 20 Benadryl and was instructed to take 1-2 pills 3x a day.

2.	⁠My initial symptoms to hours into the flight were raised hives from my shoulders to my groin and a scratchy sensation in my throat. I have been hospitalized about five times for this, and only once did I ever have issues with my throat. During that same reaction where I had issues with my throat, I went into anaphylactic shock, briefly lost consciousness, and embarrassingly urinated myself in front of my fellow EMTs (I was still an EMT during that time and had to be transported by my coworkers). This being said, I was very, very afraid of going into anaphylactic shock again. I do not know what causes my allergies, but it is environmental. Whatever was in the economy section was causing a reaction and it as only making it worse. Staying in economy for the whole flight would have sent me into anaphylactic shock, like it did at the end of the flight, and would have killed me if we did not land early. Luckily, I found that the allergen was not near the bathroom/back of the plane.

3.	⁠The doctor I referred to was a medical consultation service. I was very unclear about this. They communicated to the medical advisor through the cockpit, where I was not allowed. I had written down all of the drugs I had taken that day on a piece of paper 30 minutes after the onset of my allergies so that they could read it to the medical advisor. This is the list below: 
6 Benadryl 
100 mg of prednisone 
My daily antihistamine

The flight attendants read on the bag of Benadryl that the dosage was 1-2 3x per day. The medical advisor advised that I have no more Benadryl on the flight as I had already take my daily dose and that I use a cold compress (I have this in writing). The flight attendants tried to stop my use of Benadryl after that. They even tried to take it away, but I didn’t let that happen. If they took away that medication, I believe I would have gone into anaphylactic shock on that plane as I had about 12 more hours to at that point and Benadryl lasts about 4 hours on your average sized person (I am 6’3” and 200 pounds - not average sized).

4. The flight attendants did not take me from my seat to a different location. I was left in my seat where the allergen was for about 10 minutes. I then started to frequent the bathroom to monitor my hives. It was back there near the bathroom I felt a difference in the air and realized that my allergen was not near there (seems strange but when the air can kill you, you can feel the difference in your lungs and mouth and on your skin). After I realized that, I started sitting in the flight attendant’s pull down chair that was in the back. I remained there for almost the rest of the flight. They tried to get me to leave a few times before we landed, but I told them no and that I would die. They told me I had to go back to my seat for breakfast and they made me leave that seat. I hid in the bathroom for about 30 minutes until that meal was over. They tried to get me come out of the bathroom as I had been i there for a while during those 30 minutes, but I lied and made a fake excuse to stay in without being bothered. After breakfast, I went back the flight attendants seat and was not bothered until landing. I asked if I could sit in that seat for landing, but was told no. I finally complied and went back to my seat after arguing for a couple minutes. I was in my economy seat for about 30 minutes and then we landed. I realized I was breaking out again and that my throat was itchy. I kept drinking water to see if it was just a dry throat (Benadryl dries your throat and I had 12 by that point) but I realized the sensation was related to the allergy. After landing, and while we were being taxied, I began to have the sensation of my throat closing and I began to feel faint. I immediately got up (no one else was standing at the time because the pilot had not said people could get up from their seats yet) and approached a flight attendant who was seated. I told them I am about to use my epi pen, that I need an ambulance, and that I need to be the first one off the plane. They rushed me to the front once the pilot deemed it was safe to stand and I used my epi pen once I got off the plane. After that I was unassisted on a long walk customs from the gate and went to the hospital.

I wish they did not try to make me stop taking antihistamines so early in the flight, I wish I had better medical consultation, and I wish I could have stayed in the  flight attendants seat for longer and did not have to seek refuge in a bathroom.

This all being said, is there anything legal counseling could do? I at least want a refund of the entire flight (it was about 1000 dollars)."

128,Can a hotel legally allow homeless people to clean your room?,"This is in Wyoming. 

&#x200B;

So I'm staying at an extended stay motel for work. Been here a few weeks, the owners seemed ok and I trusted them to come clean my room because they're the owners. Anyway I have tens of thousands of dollars in equipment laying around, cash, personal identity documents, etc...

So theres this guy staying in the room next to mine, who seems like hes basically one step away from homelessness. The other day my friend came over in his BMW and the guy kept asking him for money, cigarette, drugs, basically just trying to leech off him. Annoying but whatever.

Then today as I get back from work he approaches me as I enter my room and says that ""the hotel let me to clean your room"" and he asked me to spot him some money and weed. He wouldn't leave me alone when I said no and kept insisting. So I gave him 10 bucks to get him to leave me alone.

He obviously knows I have money since he saw all my stuff including my paystubs for thousands of dollars which were laying around on the table.

I have already paid for the rest of month at this hotel, so if I leave now I will be out that money. Unless I'm entitled to a refund?

Do I have any leverage over the hotel here?

I feel like my privacy has been violated and I can't even fall asleep because of my anxiety over this. I feel like this guy could easily call some homies over and rob my room while I'm away.

I can't believe the hotel would just let some random guy into my room unsupervised where he could easily steal my identity or my stuff.

Is there any possible way for me to negotiate a suspended sentence or something with the prosecution?

After while there is a flashlight and knock on the window and I was surprised and saw it was a cop. I started to open the door  but he pushed it closed hard and started shouting at me to stay in the car and just roll down the window.

I rolled down the window and he asked what I was doing there and I said I’m not doing anything. He asked where was coming from and I lied and said a friend's house. 

He wanted to know how long I was sitting there and I said an hour but then he put his hand on the car and said it was warm. He asked where the keys were and I showed them they were in the cup holder.

Then he said he could smell alcohol and told me to step out and I did the tests like following the pen and stand on one leg and he said I failed and has me blow and it was .11 and I got arrested for DUI.

I want to know if this was legal for him to do because I don't think he ever saw me driving and he shouldn't have closed the door when I tried to get out honestly I could have just walked home from there if he let me."
133,Doctor gave us the wrong information about Depo Provera (birth control) shot. Now we might be pregnant! Can we sue?,"Last Tuesday, one week ago, my girlfriend and I went down to our local women's health center to inquire about getting her on birth control. We explained that she does not have income or insurance and that currently she is living with me at my parent's house. The attendant told us to fill out some paperwork, and that the doctor would see us shortly. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were called into the doctor's office. 

A nurse privately discussed with my girlfriend what birth control options were available to her while I waited outside. Afterward, I was brought inside to meet with the doctor and my girlfriend. My girlfriend had chosen the Depo Provera shot because she felt that it was the most convenient and reliable method of birth control available to her. 

Here's where things began to get real fucked up. 

The doctor sat down with the both of us inside the clinic and told us about the side effects of the Depo Provera shot. She told us how it would prevent ovulation and how we would have to come in every 12 weeks to renew it. She also told us that the shot would take ONE WEEK to take effect. This figure, one week, was repeated to us by both the nurse and the doctor NUMEROUS times. 

Skip forward a week after having received the injection, and both my girlfriend and I decide to have unprotected sex. It feels incredible and is a whole lot more convenient than using condoms. We proceed to have unprotected sex two more times before I head online because my girlfriend is complaining about a soreness in her leg. What I find severely disturbs me. 

The Depo Provera shot apparently takes upward of two weeks to enter a woman's system and be an effective method of birth control. I call the women's center where we received the injection, and they confirm this figure to our great distress. 

Now we're both sitting down on reddit, after taking a Plan B pill this morning (about 36 hours since we began having unprotected sex) and an ovulation test which turned out to be positive. 

What can we do if my girlfriend ends up becoming pregnant after all is said and done? Do we have any rights as patients and can we sue the doctor and the nurse who attended to us for medical malpractice? The way we see it, we were LIED to about how soon the Depo Provera would become effective. 

Honestly, right now I'm just terrified that I might be a dad, and neither me or my girlfriend is ready to raise a child right now. We don't have the conditions for it financially or emotionally. Please help!

NOTE: We are located in Florida."
134,[Update to] [MI/USA] My girlfriend is being blackmailed on Facebook by someone who she sent nude pictures to when she was underaged. This isn't the first time this person has tried to blackmail her.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7s5utr/miusa_my_girlfriend_is_being_blackmailed_on/](Backstory.)


After I made this post this morning the Facebook account named ""Zach"" started pressing her to talk to him more and more, finally he said ""I'm going to work and when I get out we are gunna talk."" I'd had enough of feeling helpless so I told her I was going to do something about it.



I went and borrowed my friends computer and brought it to my house and spent all day making a website with no prior experience. I bought a domain name and paid for a hosting site, and began building a fake blog for my girlfriend. I planned on using the hosts analytics to get this guys IP address but it wasn't working. I did a little research and ended up teaching myself very basic HTML, I managed to hide a IP tracer in the background, as soon as someone opened the page I got a notification sent to my email with their IP address and other basic info.



My trap was set and we waited for him to respond to her. This is the conversation, 



https://imgur.com/a/dvAkS



At this point I had her switch over to Kik because I was worried about Facebook messenger fucking with the IP address tracking of the link. Once on Kik he messaged her with an account that had her name and a profile picture of her. 



https://imgur.com/a/swN6o



In between the first and second picture she sent him the link to her blog which contained her ""nudes."" Immediately I received the notification he loaded the page and I began reverse searching his IP address to get his location. I took a screenshot of it and sent him a message on FB. 


https://imgur.com/a/7Gp3c



He wouldn't read my message and instead asked her why I messaged him, he said ""ok we can do this the hard way"" and then began to say he was going to post everything. He sent her a screenshot of him messaging the ""real Jake"" and telling him to ""control his hoe because she's acting up. Then he said he posted everything on a Tumblr page. 



At this point I had her delete her Kik and her Facebook but I left mine up with his and my conversation still open. He eventually read my messages but never responded to me. I'm positive the IP address is correct and he wasn't using a VPN because the address it returned is what I thought it would.


 I really need to know where to go from here and if I did anything wrong, my girlfriend is scared as fuck right now and I'm not sure what to do now. I have an IP address that has been location searched to a town in Alberta Canada, and a lot of incriminating screenshots. Also sorry about the formating, I'm on my phone.

135,Response to the fighting,"Never used Reddit before but here we go.

So, I am a 9th grader in a Virginia school. We always have issues with fights and such but it has never been this serious.

We have had four or five physical fights in the past three days. Nothing crazy, a couple punches and it was broken up. 

Everyone thought that the fighters would just be suspended and an officer would talk to them. No. The principal gave an announcement that if there was one more fight, we would go into ""lockdown"". 

He explained that ""lockdown"" is where all four grades in the school will have separate lunches, our lunch time will be cut to thirty minutes (usually in hour), and we would not be allowed to be anywhere other than the Commons in the morning. This is school wide. 

I already knew about the war crime against collective punishment. I read up on the Geneva Convention and from what i understand, the students are not protected people until this lockdown occurs. But once it does, the school is commiting a war crime. (If I am wrong please do correct me!)

If I am right about them commiting a war crime, how would I go about informing them/ accusing them/ etc.?

And if I am wrong about the war crime, I still believe that it is wrong to punish all of us for those fights. 

Edit: I completely forgot about what was actually making me angry about this. Every student has to have a remediation course during the thirty minutes taken away. "
136,“SAVE WATER DRINK MY PISS”,"Please read question is towards the end of post. I am currently working on a project to bring awareness to the current drought here in California. I plan on doing so by printing T shirts with the slogan “SAVE WATER DRINK MY PISS” & going around local beaches and public areas to hand these T Shirts out for free. My question to this subreddit is, in doing so would it be possible for me to be accused of sexual harassment for doing this? Obviously this is a provocative slogan which is why I’ve decided to use it to bring attention to the matter through a sort of shock value approach. I have no doubt some people without context will take offense to this and I just want to be aware of any legal issues I could potentially run into while doing so. I appreciate your time and answers!

137,Is it illegal to have sex with someone without telling them you have an STD?,"My friend and this girl have been dating for a couple months now.  He has an STD that his doctor knows about.  He didn't tell the girl and now she's starting to show symptoms, but he convinced her it was just a rash and that she didn't need to go to the doctor.  He's the first guy she's ever been with so she definitely got it from him.  Is he criminally liable?  Could she sue him if she finds out she has it?  This is in Massachusetts.

138,Cops searched my house NO warrant can I fight this and win?,"Location: New Mexico.  I moved here a year ago and I have an ongoing issue with my neighbors because they are bunch of Karens if you know what I mean.

They have called the police on me like four times for noise and claiming I parked in their space.

Two weeks ago five cops are at my door and say the neighbors complained about noice (again) and also they reported I had a lot of visitors so they think I’m selling drugs from the house which was b.s.

The cops asked if they could search the house and I said no because I just wanted to sleep.

Then the lead cop said I had two options we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Either I agree to the search right there or he locks me out of the house and gets a search warrant because he said he had probable cause to search for drugs already.   

He said he had applied for like 200 search warrants and never been denied, and when he got a search warrant if he found anything I would be in deep shit but if I cooperated and let him search now he’d go easy on me and wouldn’t arrest me today. 

So I let him search, and he found illegal items; it wasn’t drugs but I don’t want to say what it was. Just a lot of stuff I re-sell on Ebay that isn’t exactly legal. Then he arrested me right there.

I posted bail and have a court date next month and I want to know was the search legal? I guess I gave consent but I feel like the cop heavily pressured me to consent and made me feel like he would search whether I agreed or not. So in my mind the search should be illegal because I had no choice he said he would search if I agreed or not.  Isn't that illegal?"
139,Can use the safe haven law to give up my baby without the fathers consent (FL),"Long story short, I am late in my pregnancy, too late for an abortion but I no longer want this child. The father (unmarried) knows I’m pregnant and actually wants this child. However I am a fairly high income earner (he’s not) and I don’t want to be on child support for the next two decades, and honestly we’re not on good terms so the thought of even coparenting is infuriating. Can I legally give up this baby right after birth without the father’s consent? In Florida I have 7 days to give up the baby to a safe haven and it could be done completely anonymous so both I and the father cannot be identified."
140,"[Boston, MA] Chinese friend living in the city on visa wants to talk to CNN about reality of Chinese government - how to do so without repercussions of Chinese government?","My friend Suzie, 38 (not her real name), is a Chinese woman who's been here since 2014, on a H1B visa. IIRC, it's for being a network administrator. She's also a queer woman, which in China, is VERY YMMV, a femme queer woman, but nonetheless in China it's not as socially acceptable, as say, the U.S or UK to be a lesbian.

Suzie loves Boston and the city's life and wouldn't have it any other way.

As it is, she's looking to do an expose to and big interview with CNN or any mainstream news network, despite this legal requirement for Chinese citizens (source: The Sun, UK newspaper):

>  In 2017 China’s National Intelligence Law, which was conceived two years ­earlier, came into force.

> That law legally requires every Chinese citizen, every Chinese organisation and every Chinese company to assist national intelligence, if ever they are called upon. 

> To put that into perspective, technically more than a billion people have a legal duty to become spies for China if their government tells them to.

She wants to expose the true story on some things in China, like how government agents sexually harassed her and demanded to know her sexual history, underwear etc. and her values on things, she said it happened in April 2013.

As it is, how can she go on CNN or some news network nationally without the repercussions of Chinese government coming for her and causing an international incident?"

144,(US) Employer won't honor my wage after I changed the contract and announced it to them.,"Edit: location is Massachusetts, USA.

Hello, I recently had a contract signed by an employer, dictating ""...$180.00 an hour, for forty hours payable by (company), for life, regardless of termination.""

As you can imagine, this is the wage I want. They toyed me around for a few weeks and they sent me a contract via email, I changed it and went in person and announced *my* changes to *my* contract. In my state that process plus a signature defines agreement to the contract. There was another contract signed, however that was physically signed in completion first. The acting body for the company signed my contract last. Both contracts state that ""... these terms and agreements will supersede any previous oral or written contracts."" I recorded the entire interaction from my shirt pocket, as directed to me to do in precaution by an employment lawyer I had help draft the contract. The employer is refusing to honor my contract stating their contract supersedes mine.

I believe I have undeniable proof that my contract supersedes the previous. My contract also designates that ""all subject matter(s) of the document is hereby deemed fair and agreed upon by both parties.""


Do I have a solid case, or did the lawyer who helped draft the contract screw me over? 

*I haven't perused legal action yet, I am looking to see exactly how to go about this process and if I should go about hiring the employment lawyer who helped with the contract."
145,"Discrimination due to wearing glasses while sitting Proctored Online Exam, Republic of Ireland / US company"," 

Background:

For my job, it is necessary for me to complete various certifications, which you can achieve by passing an online proctored exam. Like many other tech companies, this goes through \[ExamCompany, I just made that up for privacy purposes\], which is a US company. Before covid you could do this at various on site test centers, since covid it's all online proctoring. The company I work for myself is registered here in Republic of Ireland, although the company as a whole is also a US company. I am in the Republic of Ireland.

What happened:

I logged into to my proctored exam and followed all the rules and guidelines by the customer service employees. Removed my headphones, cleaned my desk etc.

Then after I had already waited for over 45 minutes to start my exam, another customer service agent called me, let's call him Mike for now. ' Mike' then asked ' your glasses is it medical?' . I was like ' uhm excuse me?' . Then Mike again said ' your glasses, could you take them off please?' . At that moment I assumed that Mike wanted to see my face without glasses for ID verification. So I took them off, then after a moment I put them on again. Then Mike again said ' your glasses can you keep them off please?' . So I got annoyed and said ' well it's a bit difficult to make an exam while being unable to see don't you think?' . Mike then disconnected and it took another half hour before I got another agent on the line. In the end, my exam was canceled due to all the technical issues, after waiting for over 1,5 hours. They did give me a voucher code to reschedule my exam free of charge, but in my opinion that's not enough.

What are my rights in this scenario?

1. Which jurisdiction is applicable here? ExamCompany (made-up name) is American, but I am in the RoI and the company that told me to take this exam is also in the RoI. Do I need to file a discrimination claim in the RoI or in the USA?
2. I already filled out the complaint form (which I could only find by nagging another customer service agent endlessly). What else can I do? Should I contact a local lawyer here in the RoI? Does the lawyer need to have expertise in US law as ExamCompany (made up name) is, to my knowledge, american?
3. Is it possible for me to claim damages due to been having so unfairly treated by the agent requesting me to remove the glasses? I could not find anything about glasses in the exam proctoring regulations.
4. Any other idea as to what rights I have in this situation? I already informed my employer about the incident and she was very empathizing. I do understand that only ExamCompany (made up name) is at fault here, and not my own employer. All my own employer did was request me to take the exam and pay for a voucher code, but they are not responsible for the exam proctoring."

I put a down payment on a rifle 4 days ago. I have a family emergency and asked the owner to refund the 943 dollars back to me so that I could afford the travel. I was told there was a 15% restocking fee. 

when I said "" restocking what? I never took the rifle from your store nor have I completed the transaction."", i was met with verbal abuse and a power trip telling me he doesn't have to do shit for me, the receipt I have says no refunds (just those two words) and fuck you, pay the remainder and  pick up the gun or dont"". yelled more and hung up on me. 


I haven't completed the transaction yet I still owe 200 on the rifle.  The rifle never left their store.


To get a ""refund"" I feel the money owed is paid in full and the item was taken from the store brought back to the store and asked for the money back. The rifle has never been in my possession.

149,Venue far more tickets than they should have to a New Years Eve event and basically cheated me out of $75. Is there any way to force them to give a refund?,"Okay, so a couple friends and I were deciding where to go for New Years Eve. We found that a local mall-type place was hosting an event  that offered live DJs, open bar from 9:00-2:00, small appetizers, etc. This place had a great location, good view and it seemed perfect, especially since we found a deal where it was discounted to $75 per person instead of the initial $125.

Well, we went there at about 10:00 and we should have known it was too good to be true the minute we got there. The entrance was absolute madness.. insane lines just to get in, get your ticket checked and put your wristband on. I'm talking lines about as bad as the security lines at a busy airport. They were selling tickets for $5 a piece to check your coat, but eventually had to stop that because they LITERALLY RAN OUT OF ROOM to store coats.. everyone who went in afterwards had to just hold on to them.

The venue itself had two bars set up and both were just absolutely mobbed. I would estimate hundreds of people waiting in a crowd around each bar. I spoke to some people afterwards and they said it took about 45 min - 1 hour to get one drink. Like, are you kidding me? I'd rather just pay normal price at that point because an hour of my time is worth far more than that.

I will say one good thing, the appetizers they had were decent. Small sliders, meatballs, etc. We ate some food and then decided to leave after about half an hour and went to a different place near our apartment which was much better and only had a $20 cover. Nice crowd, cheap drinks. Should have just gone there in the first place.

Basically, I think it is 100% obvious that they sold too many tickets. They knew, or damn well should have known, the place could only reasonably accommodate a certain number of people, but they sold far more tickets than that anyway. I think it is fraudulent to advertise an event as having an open bar if it requires you to stand in line for an hour to get a single drink. I feel like I paid $75 for some OK sliders.

Is there any point in pursuing a class action lawsuit against the organizers? Location is New Jersey btw.  

EDIT: Just realized there's a typo in the title and I can't edit that. Should say venue SOLD far more tickets. Oh well."

153,(New Orleans) Can a minor give permission for the police to search her mom's house?,"My family is having a bit of drama and I don't know anything about the law so I came here to see if I get answers to my question.

My niece is 15. She lives with her mom, her mom's sister (my SIL's) and her cousin (my nephew, age 18). She was prescribed painkillers. My nephew was taking them. My niece called the police on him. The police came and she was home alone and she let them in and gave them permission to come in and look around. They found her empty prescription bottle in the garbage can in his room and so they went looking for him. He was arrested with some of the pills in his car, all in single baggies and they found incriminating messages on his phone.

All of this has caused a great deal of drama in my family. My niece is staying with her dad now and my nephew is now facing felony charges. Was it legal for my underage niece to allow the police to come in and search her mom and aunt's house without them home. If the police had not come in they would not have had probable cause to stop and search my nephew. My niece also didn't tell her doctor to have the prescription replaced or report it to the pharmacy. Did this have to happen first? I am just questioning if the police search was legal and if it will affect my nephew's case?"

I'm on a laser treatment for a pigments disorder areas on my back and thigh. The treatment's been going on for nearly a year and my thigh's pigment area's coming to a full heal. However, at the clinic today the nurse who done the laser treatment to me made a mistake and raise the heat to 1350 decimals instead of 350 on the thigh area and it cause a big burn. It will swell and I'll feel lot of pain later I'm sure. The doctor went in to exam me later and said it's only as bad as a sun burn and will prescript some burn medicines to me.

I'm still at the clinic right now trying to get a report for today but front desk said they can't give it until doctor reviewed and published and come back to next visit. I didn't like this at all and I'm going to file a complaint against them, perhaps sue if the burn is severe. I wonder if anyone's gone through the complaint process before and what kind of documents I must have?

So far I asked for - Nurse's name & ID, doctor's name who examined me after the burn, clinic name, clinic's ID, a report of what happened today sign and acknowledge by the clinic, the laser treatment machine model.

156,Wrongfully Accused of Shoplifting. Recorded Interaction. Civil Recompense Possible?,"Hi, today I was wrongfully accused of shoplifting and told to exit a store (it was a CVS/Walgreens). What are my options?

I surreptitiously recorded the final 15 minutes of the interaction with my cell phone held to my chest (I googled it on my phone beforehand, it's in a single-party consent state and obviously the store had signs everywhere advising patrons and employees they were being surveilled.)

It seems likely I'm not the only customer this store management has engaged in similar behavior towards, and rather than letting the humiliation slide, I'd like to pursue any form of punishment I can upon the store and its management.

It seems there isn't much I can do as far as filing any sort of civil rights complaint, etc., the federal website makes clear they ""don't pursue single instances"" and short of sitting outside that store for the rest of my life hoping I'm there when it happens to someone else, so I can get their info to file a complaint, I don't see any productive options on that end.

From Googling online, it seems I should request the store retain it's surveillance video before they destroy it? How do I do so without paying a lawyer to send such a request?

What other options do I have?

Note: I'm happy to post my video online for anyone's review if that might be helpful. I'm hesitant to now, as I'm worried wilfully posting a (humiliating) video might hurt my chances to later claim some sort of damages from said humiliation?

The video isn't particularly exciting, I can sum up it up thusly:

* I start the video (after becoming uncomfortable from this woman who had been following me around, literally less than 2 feet from me the entire time, while I was Googling the contents of Atkins snacks and comparing them). If memory serves, I'm not sure I said anything to her prior to that, other than when entering the store and asking if they offered 'low-carb' foods

* 3ish minutes after starting the surreptitious recording, I begin to ask her a question (specifically I ask her what exactly ""net carbs""means vs the carbs on the nutritional panel). 

* Her responses are bizarre and aggressive. (I'm not kidding. They were along the lines of, ""Are you trying to be condescending to me?"" ""Why are you condescending to me"" I find that bizarre, making me feel like maybe she wasn't following me around for shoplifting and is genuinely possibly crazy. At that point I ask her if anyone else can help me.)

* Over the span of 7 minutes I find another employee, ask them the net carbs question, and discuss it with them. While this is happening, she's started talking on the phone with (presumably) her manager.

* I hear something along the lines of ""he has a white backpack and he's black."" I didn't register that she had said it at the time, because truthfully, I was more concerned with the net carbs question (if you've ever tried a no carb diet you'll understand).

* The final 5 minutes are her, phone in hand, coming up to me declaring ""You need to leave the store now."" Me saying ""Why?"". At that point, I was a bit surprised to be kicked out as I assumed any crazy theories of hers might abate once I finished my purchase. But I did insist on her giving me a reason, even when she began to declare ""I'm calling the police right now."" As I hadn't done anything wrong, I wasn't particularly worried about the police coming. But I am under the impression, however, that (admittedly from myself or friends being a bit too drunk in bars during undergrad) that any private business can throw you out/refuse you service for any reason. However, I did still insist on asking why repeatedly. I wanted her to state a reason (in the event it was, as I suspected, based on me being a 20ish African American male in a store primarily frequented by affluent suburban whites).

* Finally she does give an answer, which is slightly elucidating, ""You come in here all the time and steal. You and your white backpack full of our things. Don't ever come back here. I know someone saw you steal once. 2 weeks ago. You're always here.""

* Now, I'm rarely even in this State in question, as I'm only there when I'm looking after my parent's home when they've gone out of state or if I'm visiting for some reason (sometimes just to do laundry--which is expensive in the city). I don't doubt I've been in this store before, but never any time of particular note, as I couldn't tell you the last time I was in the store. Either way, at this point I leave, having received my answer.

In the best case scenario, this employee was going only by description and confused me with another African American male with a white backpack who was a known shoplifter (although, in that case I'm not sure why they wouldn't just immediately call the police?). Or maybe I had been inside that store beforehand and they assumed I had shoplifted then?

In the worst case scenario, that employee harasses any African American who enters this store (it's not an expensive store, but it's in a very affluent area and provides things, like prescriptions or groceries, only someone living locally would be interested in shopping for), and anyone they've harassed has been so embarrassed/not a local so they've just never pushed back and this nasty person has never faced consequences.

**Either way, I find this treatment ludicrous, and I'm furious at the idea that there doesn't seem to be an easy way for me to exact punishment. Is there no means of punishing a discriminatory business in this country unless they've posted a sign up that says ""Whites Only""?!?!**

157,i bought almond ice cream for myself and my allergic roommate ate some,he has history of eating my ice cream so i bought almond because i know he can’t eat it. but he did eat it and now i’m worried he might try to charge me for something
158,Police waited outside of my work to pull me over for having no license plates,"I live in nebraska, US, for context. 

I have been driving my car without plates or insurance because money has been very tight and it’s the only way for my boyfriend and I to get to our jobs. 

Yesterday as I was closing, I noticed a cop car parked across the street just sitting there in a position to where he could easily see where my car was parked. I didn’t know for sure if they were for me, but I had the suspicion. About ten minutes later I was done and the cop was gone. My plan was to just quickly go home (I live directly five blocks down the street) and get to work on getting insurance because I had just got paid and could actually afford it with this check since my boyfriend got his tax returns and we would be alright. 

I got into my car and as soon as I pulled out, the cop pulled out from behind a car a block back at the exact same time and followed me a block before pulling me over. He said they noticed I had been driving for more than 60 days without plates and asked how long I had the car. I said three months. 

I’m being charged with expired tags and no proof of insurance. I have court on the 11th for the fine and to plead guilty/not guilty. 

What should I do? I’m not upset that I was caught, but about the fact that the cop had sat out there for so long and then moved so I thought he had left. Is that illegal? It just doesn’t feel right. My boyfriend wants to fight it on the terms that it’s harassment, but I just don’t know what’s the best way to approach this so that i don’t come out with insane debt that I can’t afford right now. Any advice would really be appreciated

Tldr: cop sat outside my work and then hid down the block until I left so he could immediately pull me over. My boyfriend and I think we should fight it, but I’m not sure. I need advice please."
159,Harassed by Home Owners Association can I turn off their water,"I love in California and the home owners association for the neighborhood we live in are constantly sending us notices about various things we need to do with our house for example we recently got a fine because we had 2 signs in the yard and your only allowed one however 1 was an ADT sign informing people that there are cameras on the property (which is legally required in Ca) and the other sign was a graduation sign for my sister. They have sent 2 other notices in the last month all for different things, and my parents don’t want to go to file harassment because it’s not worth the effort. Everyone has their water shutoff valves behind their garage, so could I legally shut off their water (I only plan to do this for 2 days before turning it back on)"
160,Can the police change their mind and give you a speeding ticket later?,"This is in NJ. 

Long story short, I got pulled over for speeding. To give me a ""break"", the officer gave me three bullshit tickets, one of them being for my plate being obstructed from the frame that came from the car dealership. 

I spoke to the manager at the dealership, he said he'd pay for it but recommended I pay it myself because he'd have to report the fact that he paid the ticket to the police department. And that if they found out, they'd give me the real speeding ticket that I deserve because they have radars. 

So, will the police department be able to hunt me down, take me to court and prove that I was speeding? And if they can, will the judge accept this practice and make me accountable? The fact they're giving bullshit tickets then when I call them out they give me a speeding ticket. Has that ever happened before?


Should I insist the dealership pay for all three bs tickets? Do I have a case to take the dealership to court because it was their fault I got these tickets? The dealership didn't prevent me from removing the frame. But they're actively being accomplices in malpractice of the law, they're aware of what the police department is doing. They're knowingly putting these shitty frames that will end up getting you tickets. 


Edit: What this all comes down to: Are the cops likely to hunt my ass down for having the dealership pay the tickets? 

I can tell you the dealership manager was pissed when I bluffed and said I spoke to my lawyer and he highly recommended I take his offer of paying. 


Edit 2: The three tickets in total are 162 dollars. I think I'm just going to pay them for now. But after that, I'm going to come back to the dealer and ask to be reimbursed without providing the ticket numbers (aka asking not to be snitched on) if they ever want my business again. "
161,Can I use any legal tender to pay child support?,"My divorce decree says I just have to pay $350 a month. Doesn't say how or when. For the last 5 years I've been paying by check but one or two bounced and she is refusing to accept them now. She is asking that I pay via ACH or electronic transfer or check through my bank. She refusing to take cash from me.  

Since the decree doesn't stipulate, I'd like to pay her in change as a statement. Like when I drop my kid off just hand her a bucket of change for exactly $350. Does she legally have to accept that if the decree doesn't say how I have to pay her?

What happens if she just refuses to take it?    


I've done this with creditors before and they have always taken it.

162,Got a call from my apartment manager about my dog. She may have to be removed from the property. I feel this is not fair. What are my options?,"[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8uywmz/one_of_the_kids_my_dog_usually_plays_with_wasnt/)

I’m in WA State. 

Got a call from my apartment manager today. No surprise. Sure enough, there was a complaint over the weekend that my dog “attacked” someone (NOT true.)

So I gave her my side of the story. I told her my dog did not “attack” anyone. My dog did not bite, lunge, growl or bark at the girl. I was outside the entire time and witnessed this. Her father was not.

The apartment manager is gathering statements from other residents who supposedly “witnessed the attack.” I have major concerns about this. There is a big community of a certain ethnic group who live at the apartment complex (the family accusing us is part of this community.) They all know each other and regularly go to each other’s apartments, etc. I am concerned that I will not get fair representation in the matter as the apartment manager said she will only be interviewing residents who “witnessed the attack” (whom the accusers are all friends with.)

I asked the apartment manager if she’d be willing to talk to my friends, family, other residents, as well as apartment staff who have been at my apartment when the kids have interacted with my dog. She said she will only be taking statements from people who “witnessed the attack” (again, no one but me, my pup, and the little girl were in the courtyard during this incident.)

If the “witnesses” say my pup was being aggressive, she will have to be removed from the property. This is giving me terrible anxiety. She is my emotional support animal. I can not afford to move or break my lease. What are my options? 

Edit: My dog is an 18 lb. French Bulldog "
163,[WA] Taken to jail for violating a restraining order that was not in my name.,"(Had to repost due to error in title. Apologies.)

In 2012 I spent a few days in jail because of a restraining order. In the restraining order, my name is incorrectly stated and my birthday is incorrect. The officer said ""Close Enough"" and took me to jail. I've read the statute of limitations on cases like this is ~2 years. As a result of and in addition to this incident, I also have a domestic violence charge to my name that currently (as of 2017) affects my ability to get a job.

Does the statute of limitations apply to a situation that has consequences as a result of a false imprisonment? It is past the ~2 years for the initial false imprisonment, but I still feel the effects of the situation. Can I pursue a legal matter?"
164,My 20 yr. old son who I haven't ever spoken with is trying to blackmail me into paying backpay for child support. Can I sue him? [Canada],"I am in Nova Scotia Canada.

To get specific I made a mistake when I was young and left his mother because I was not in any position to raise a child. She never pursued child support probably because she didn't want anything to do with me and knew if I was giving her money then I would want to see my son. We were never married. I was 19.

Anyway 20 years later I get a letter from my son who I have never spoken to and he is telling me I owe him thousands of dollars in backpay. I guess he wants me to pay for his college. Well I have two young daughters now and I am happily married and I couldn't pay him even if I wanted to which I don't.

He is threatening to involve lawyers etc and raising a big stink. He claims that because his mom raised him by herself for all this time and I never contributed anything it is ""right"" for me to chip in now. I do not believe he has a leg to stand on but I am just making sure. I do not want to hire a lawyer unless I am at risk in which case I will do it.

Thank you for your help."

166,Fertility Clinic Lost Semen Sample,"  This just happened, so I am a little pissed….

Wife and I had a baby 2 years ago using a fertility clinic. Trying to have number 2 for the last several months (we are almost 40 so we are not at our reproductive prime and every wasted month is precious). Went today to deposit a semen sample so my wife could have an IUI today. 

Wife goes to clinic and after a 90 minute wait is informed that they made a mistake and the sample went for an analysis instead of being prepared for an IUI, so it is essentially destroyed. Timing is everything with an IUI, so I could go give another sample but I am too pissed to step foot in that building.

I am beyond livid – I feel like I should let everyone of their patients know that this type of this could happen to them. What are my options?"
167,Just off the lot (~200mi) 2022 car totaled by underinsured driver (they are deemed at fault). Their insurance is starting to cause problems.,"Location: Phoenix, Az
Date: Sunday Jan. 16th 2022

My dad just bought my mom a new car for her Birthday Dec. 8th. It was custom ordered so they had to wait for it to be built (Ordered late Nov, Dec. 8th build date on her Birthday, delivery expected ~late Dec. - mid Jan.) My parents went to pick up the car and drove it home on Jan. 9th. This is the first ever new car my mom(52) has owned, and it was something she was really excited about.

They decided to celebrate they were going to take out their brand new car on a day trip to enjoy and get used to it. Before they were even out of the city they hit a large slowdown due to construction after cresting a hill, so they slowed down and eventually stopped. Moments later they were impacted hard from behind (while they had been stopped for 30s -1min) There are police already on the scene and the accident is dealt with, the other vehicle was towed and my parents car was still operational so they drove to their home and called me to take them to the ER. They are fine, just shaken up and had to take a few days off work for muscle pain/fatigue 

according to the other drivers insurance company, the driver reported they were going between 40 and 50 miles an hour at the time of the collision. It was probably faster than that because everyone talks down how fast they were going to try to avoid more punishment. This seems extremely negligent and alone should pose grounds for further damages or compensation.

A few days past, their insurance is taking the full responsibility and decided to total out the car due to a bent frame, but the at fault driver only has 15k liability (Az State minimum) my parents do have underinsured motorist coverage, but did not purchase gap insurance as they planned to pay the car in full at time of sale (that was messed up by the agent doing the paperwork and didn't include a deposit they placed when getting their build slot, so they had to have it on a loan until that paperwork was straightened out) 

My parents had to take several days off work, they had to share a car for 3 days after that until the rental (that their insurance will be paying for) came, my father was forced to work from home during that time, my mother is extremely distraught as this was the nicest and newest car she had ever had and only had it for a handful of days.

The issue lies here,
Their insurance company is going to pay the $15,000, and offered a maximum of $5,000 total for medical expenses, inconvenience', as well as pain and suffering between the two of them. Which we feel is disrespectfully low considering my mother is still as of posting this and having anxiety/emotional distress, as well as tension headaches due to this accident. Even just talking to her about it last night getting more of this information caused her to burst into tears again. 

My parents insurance will be paying out the difference in the price of a USED 2022 Toyota Corolla with 200 miles (actual amount is tbd) the car was $27,000 new. 
The difference in value aside, If my parents decided to purchase a brand new car again to replace exactly what they lost (Same spec must be ordered factory), It wouldn't arrive until April. Their insurance company is only willing to pay for the rental until my parents accept the $15,000 + $5,000. Basically once they are able to pay for the car their insurance will not continue to provide transportation until the new car arrives. 
Overall this seems extremely disrespectful to my parents as the initial pain and suffering amount was under $3,000, And they said the most they could do was $5,000 as well as not covering the rental car.

 What are our options here? Do we take them to court? My parents have never been in a situation like this, neither have I,
and we're at a loss for what to do. 

As of right now we are waiting for them to come pick up the car, we have not accepted the $5k, And we are still waiting on the official police report.

Edit: Why the heck are all my replies being downvoted? Kinda rude guys. I'm trying to see what I can do / advice I can offer for my parents having been in this really stressful situation. :/"
168,"My ex- told me she was raped by a classmate, then I was threatened and arrested for exaggerated charges after trying to turn him in, then she says in an email a month later that she was repeatedly pressured by our university to file a police report and was sexually assaulted. [CA]","In late March, the woman (A) I still loved told me a man (B) in all of my classes raped her after a party... Then we get into a really intense argument while I was driving about tuning him in, she is crying and saying that she simply can't do it. But I was experiencing a manic episode (clinically bipolar) triggered by amphetamines and was too wrapped up in the hysteria to empathize with her position. There was no compromise in my mind, if I had to see him in class I was definitely going to be arrested for felony assault/battery and I was on probation.. I kept persisting and trying to convince her that we have to go to the police right now for the rape kit, but she was screaming her lungs out at me. A block away from the police station, she started mauling my face and I am forced to pull over immediately. She stopped clawing me when we pull over and she hops out, I'm screaming out of anger and banging on the window. Then sure enough, a cop car across the street saw it all unfold, flashes their sirens and interview the both of us. I tell them what happened (aside from her assaulting me) and they talk to her for 10 minutes, then I'm let go and told to leave her alone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I started completely whacking out after that; I called everyone I knew at the party to see if there had been an suspicious behavior/actions from B. I didn't explicitly say that she assaulted, but it was very evident from my syntax and sense of urgency. 

&#x200B;

The next day (Monday), I went to the Assistant Dean of Students (C) trying to figure out what the wisest decision would be.. I tell her everything I knew aside from the names involved and she tells me that it is up to A to file the complaint if I am not willing to disclose their identities.

&#x200B;

That afternoon I get a phone call from her ex-boyfriend of two years (D) telling me that A does not want to go the police because I'm on probation, but will do what she has to do if I keep pursuing B. I basically told him to fuck off because the threat made no sense. Then he calls my dad; D continues to reference my criminal history throughout conversation, validates the rape allegations, and says she is ""not stable, but definitely not suicidal."" 

&#x200B;

That night I contact the student government rep of my major and tell him everything I knew, and the dominoes began to fall. He schedules an interview with A and notifies the administration; I had done everything I could do and I completely detach myself from the circumstance with hopes that I will never have to see B again in my life.

&#x200B;

The next day : C tells me that I am intermittently suspended for:

&#x200B;

1. It was reported that on March 25,, 2018 you forced A into your car, physically grabbed her arms and neck, and forcibly pushed her out of a moving car.

2. It has been reported that you have publicly accused another student of sexual assault.

&#x200B;

I get photos that night from D of the letter she wrote to the school and he asked me how the revenge had gone.

&#x200B;

Then I am arrested that Thursday for Felony Kidnapping, Domestic Violence, and Criminal threats; the case was dropped by the DA, but the CA picked it up as a misdemeanor because of my previous violent charge (or so I think).

&#x200B;

I then receive an email from A quoted in the email I sent to C, which should explain the gaps in my story/logic.

&#x200B;

""Dear C,

&#x200B;

I have a direct quotation  from the Complainant's own writing that unequivocally accuses yourself  and the campus police of violating the Title IX Policy and Procedure. 

&#x200B;

Here are the three components of the Title IX Policy and Procedure for the Complainant's Intake Interview that pertain to filing a police report:   


**"" 5. Inform the Complainant of the right to file a criminal complaint with local law enforcement or with the Office for Civil Rights;**  
 **6. Offer to assist the Complainant with filing a criminal complaint;**  
 **7. Assure the Complainant that such filing will not significantly delay the College investigation; ""**  


This is what the complainant has stated verbatim, **""the LAST thing I want to do was go to the police because I knew you were on  probation but the school kept pressuring me to file a police report and then the campus security as well""**   
Less than a month after the sequence of events transpired on April 17th, she made the definite accusation against yourself in the attached email and there would be no room for interpretation in a court of law. If  there is any ambiguity in her writing, please inform me.  
I notified you the afternoon of March 26th at the CSE that my  ex-girlfriend, of whom you found out was A the following day,  told me she was raped and hated me for my pursuit of B. We  spoke for roughly forty-five minutes and I explained to you everything I  knew outside of the names of the students involved.  
Both definitive statements made from myself to you on March 26th are  verified in the following paragraph from the same email on April 17th.

  
**""I was sexually assaulted by B yes. I was in denial. and then when you  were chasing me down yelling at me saying i cheated on you i kept  realizing how much i really didn't like it and then i said i was raped. I  don't know if i was raped maybe i didn't try hard enough idk but i was  definitely sexually assaulted. the fact that you think would fucking  make that up to ruin your life is disgusting. I had to go to fucking  planned parenthood and get checked for STDs bc i was fucking assaulted  how humiliating is that and then you went and messaged EVERYBODY. how  fucking embarrassing. I never wanted to take the issue to the school  because i don't feel threatened by him he's a complete fucking imbecile.  But the fact that you took what happened to me and used it to try and  get revenge is just disgusting.""**

  
You were fully aware and informed of the possibility that A could have been **""raped""** by B and emotionally compromised by my revenge towards him; yet you and the Campus Police proceeded to **""pressure""**  a traumatized, sexual assault victim into filing a police report. If  A's language is indicative of any other conclusion, please  inform me.   
Regardless of your obvious deviation from the Title IX Procedure and clear-cut negligence as Assistant Dean of Students, what was stated in my previous email still stands:

  
**""The first confounding article of evidence that needs acknowledgement are the threats made through D, A's ex-boyfriend, the afternoon of March 26th, 2018. In the phone call I received at roughly 5:00 pm, there were two vital aspects of the conversation. First, he confirmed that the rape did indeed happen; B had violated A and stated verbatim that she was “not stable, but definitely not suicidal.” A testimony in itself that should raise reasonable doubt to the truthfulness and permissibility of any statements or allegations provided by A. A has clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders, was reliant on 150 mg of Escitalopram (nearly ten-fold the recommended FDA dosage), and consumed excessive marijuana and alcohol near the end of our relationship. Coupled with the fact that she had told me verbatim“I was raped” the night before, the psychological state D described seemed entirely accurate. But the derivative of A’s motive appeared when D brought up the fact that I am on misdemeanor probation and executed a veiled threat in regards to my revenge towards B. He told me verbatim that A “doesn’t want to report me because of my prior, but will have to do what she has to do to protect herself \[if I keep pursuing B\].” The behavior D exhibited was erratic, questionable and indicative of A’s compromised neuro-chemical stability. Here are three isolated incidents that corroborate with my allegations. The first is addressed in a previous email with the police report that discounts all four of the University’s allegations towards myself. Officer E stated, “Based on my observations and statements obtained I did not feel that the incident rose to the level of a crime, and it appeared more to be a ‘415 boyfriend/girlfriend.’” Along with an abundance of other inconsistencies between Officer E's and A’s account; from him not witnessing what A had stated just happened to her before exiting the vehicle, to “not appearing distressed or traumatized” after I had allegedly assaulted and threatened her. Her formal allegations submitted days later towards myself simply do not make empirical sense, police trained to be hyper-vigilant of domestic violence experienced an alternative timeline to A’s and did not believe I committed a crime. Second, following the phone call from D, I contacted the Film Student Government Representative, F at around 11pm and told him everything I knew regarding the sexual assault allegations. He reached out to A and scheduled a meeting for the following morning. The timing of A’s letter is remarkably syncopated with my deviation from D’s demands, and the motive becomes exceptionally clear. Especially when I receive texts with photographs on March 28th of A’s letter to F from D, asking me how my revenge had gone. This daunting correlation further transcends into causation from the fact that my father received a phone call from D as well later that evening on March 26th. D validated the “rape” allegations, also stated that “she was not stable, but not suicidal,” and mentioned my vulnerable criminal history in correspondence to my pursuit of B; which my father also interpreted as a veiled threat. Beginning with a crime that never occurred in the eyes of officers of the law and their testimony that refutes all four of the allegations against me, then evolving into As indirect threats through D that are validated by my father’s testimony, and finally the execution of her mandate in correspondence to my conversation with F; there are a myriad of ethically devoid actions made towards myself that need to be addressed.""**  


>If  there is any inclination of my allegations not bearing the truth,  please inform me. I will provide you with phone records, testimonies,  and any other evidence I can attain.

169,(New York) Life insurance policy on ex-husband who pays child support. He does not consent.,"The children are 5 and 4 and he's their legal father and pays child support. I want to take a life insurance policy on him to make sure that if something were to happen to him, the money will be there to support the kids. Of course I'm happy to pay for the policy myself.

I talked to him about it and he said he does not consent, out of spite. We divorced two years ago. 

Given that me and the children have an insurable interest in his life, can this be done without his consent, or perhaps through a court order requiring him to consent?"

- **not** following COVID protocols in his office.  

- anti-vaxxer.  I don't know if his child has been vaccinated. 


I unsuccessfully did an internet search, and couldn't figure out if his actions are illegal as a chiropractor. 


Is there a California licensing board or association to report his behavior to, or a regulatory body?  In a different subreddit, someone suggested reporting his anti-COVID actions to the county health department, which I'll do.

171,I was assaulted over a parking spot and the police sided with the accused.,"IIT: Assaulting someone < Ripping a guys plate off for evidence.

Also sarcasm is completely lost on at least 85 people that read this post. 

Edit #1when. I said I was getting a drink, I was at a convenience store grabbing a bottle of brisk iced tea and for anyone that still doesn't know that is a non-alcoholic beverage. Someone actually said the reason the cops didn't side with me was because I was drunk. At no point do I say in this post I was drunk. Also to the people saying all the cops have is no evidence of the assault and only evidence that I had his plate, there were two eyewitnesses that I told the police about, I gave the contact information of one and the other one was the owner of a bar within the same plaza, as far as I currently know the police did not look into my witnesses whatsoever as I talked to one of them and she said she never received a phone call. once again it took them 6 hours to get here, the bar was probably closed not that they were going to check that witness anyway. and they didn't contact the witness that was in my passenger seat. She had other errands to do that day so she was not there when the police finally showed up. Now I think because the court dates have already been handed out to me I don't think there's anything else I can do with the local police. But given the fact that he did not get a court date for the assault my witnesses can't even give their statement. 

Edit #2 This is the legal advice subreddit, but everyone here seems to think we're in r/Captainhindsight. Almost every comment is about how ""I"" should have done things differently. That's not what I'm here for, And that's not what this place is about. So to all the people who actually said nothing productive, and just laid into me about what I ""should have done"" y'all can sit and spin. And to the very few people that actually know what this subreddit is for, and gave advice. Thank you. Its taken into consideration. 

Edit #3 apparently people still think I was  intoxicated because they couldn't understand certain euphemisms I used durring this post. The word punch-drunk does not ** mean I was drinking alcohol

The actual definition is this: 

punch-drunk

/ˈpənCHˌdrəNGk/

adjective

stupefied by or as if by a series of heavy blows to the head.

So that basically means after sustaining blows to the Head my cognitive function was not working properly I was in duress adrenaline and I just got smacked in the head so any actions that I did during the 30 seconds from him opening his mouth to him walking back into his car and me taking the plate. I cannot be blamed for any action that happened after I sustained injuries to the Head. That absolutely will not fly in court. Secondly if everyone thinks that I ripped the plate off vindictively as he hopped back into his car, driving away from a violent crime he just committed I tried to stop his car but the only thing I could grab onto was his plate which incidentally came off as he started to drive away from the violent crime he just committed. To which I immediately called the police to explain the situation. I had no intention of fighting this man at all. But I am allowed to stand by my car as far as I'm concerned that's not illegal and someone walking up to me and punching me in the head several times, I am apparently in the complete wrong for simply standing by the door of my car in a parking lot and then after I was assaulted I cannot be blamed for any actions because I wasn't thinking straight. I'd like to see a few people take a couple knocks to their head, And then try to say the alphabet backwards. I can't believe I really had to even make this edit but people are really of the opinion that I deserved to be assaulted by someone twice my size because I simply didn't hop into my car  I shouldn't have to go into my car for cowering for safety while at a local convenience store grabbing a soda. This isn't fucking Compton. There's relatively no gang violence here and it's not like there's a local rapist running around. In this society I should feel safe from harm to my body and possessions regardless any words said. I committed no hate crime I essentially said ""yeah fuck you too."" We both said equal verbal abuse to one another and this man within 5 seconds went from 0 to 100 and  immediately started with the assault. I don't believe in any way that I am in the wrong and if any of you think otherwise you're probably just a psychopathic is the guy that assaulted me. Thank you. 


I live in Brampton Ontario Canada. i went to a convenience store by my house on my way home to get a drink. on my way out son Douch bag said something along the lines of ""there fucking lines on the ground for a fucking reason. its winter here and the road and faded paint are in pretty shit condition. So I replied back with ""yea fuck you too"" the guy the hops out of his car, and so did I, now in most instances like this all people do is just talk shit till one guy figures its not worth it, and leave, this is the exception, this man came up to my face, grabbed my shirt and just started feeding me fists, he then hopped back in his car and started to drive away. i tried to read his plate but i was punch drunk, in duress, and Adrenalin pumping, so as he drove away i grabbed onto his licence plate, and it ripped off as he drove away, i then immediately called the police, now this happened at 4:30 pm the cops showed up at my house at 10:30pm a whole 6 hours later. and there only concern WAS HIS PLATE! That's the first thing they asked me for, not are you alright, do you need medical assistance, nothing. wheres the plate? i handed it to them as I was only holding it as evidence about the occurrence. I earlier found out where he lived by driving around the neighbourhood looking for a blue honda with no plate. yellow paged the address, and found a last name to the house, facebook the last name and found the culprit. also found his insta gram where he trains as a mma/boxer, I'm just an average dude, so when the cops come i show my torn shirt, the fact i had the plate number and everything, had him dead to rights. THEY CHARGED ME WITH THEFT AND VANDALIZEM BECAUSE I TOOK HIS PLATE. i all ready did their fucking job of finding the guy, and there is no cameras where the indecent happened, and once again, dazed, and rocked, i did the next best thing before he drove off, the cops even victim shamed me saying that i could have taken a photo, right...... and the cherry on top. the future wife beater got a ""stern talking to"" by the police.... i have no faith in the justice system anymore. this was fucking unbelievable. not that they were working the case durring this time anyway for 6 hours but i sure as shit saved them a bunch of fucking time going to the plaza and looking at grainy images that may or may not exist on the cameras at the plaza. and I get charged...... is there any body i can contact to right this clear wrong, apparently in ontario, the police get to pick who gets charged not the victim. they actually said to me, just because he assaulted you doesn't give you the right to vandalise his property. MOTHER FUCKER IF I DIDN'T DO THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND HIM TO BEGAN WITH.

TL;DR: I got assaulted, ripped the guys plate off as he started to drive away as evidence that it was him, and i got charged with theft and vandalizem and the assaulter got no charge what so ever."

I wasn't around them when he said that, but I can't believe he would have given someone else mercy when not me.

176,Immediate Help needed! My wife is threatening not to allow me to have my kid because I'll be late.,"My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. We have a six year old. She has primary custody and I have visitation. I am suppose to pick him up on Fridays at 4 but today I had to go in two hours late and work for someone ( I work in retail). I told her a few hours ago when she texted me to make sure I was coming today that I wouldn't be there until 6:30. The custody order in the decree say 4 and doesn't say anything about lateness. I get him 3 weekends a month for a total of six days a month. 

My wife says she has plans tonight for a work event in another town and she only made them because she knew it was my weekend. She said she needs to leave by 4:45 to make it and will be taking him with her if I don't show by 4:45. 

It is impossible for me to leave work at 4:45. I can not leave until 6:15 and it would take me 15 minutes to get to her house so 6:30 is my only reasonable time. 

We are suppose to make reasonable accommodations to the custody schedule when we have emergencies. I consider this a work emergency. 

What are my rights here? 

She is saying if I am not there by 4:45 she is taking my son with her and I can a) either drive out to that town and hour and a half away and pick him up b) I can see him on saturday when she drives in probably around 10am 

My argument is that I am sometimes late. She knows my schedule isn't like that and 4pm isn't always feasible.  And that she is taking a kid at age 6 to a work art show. She claims it isn't that kind of adult art show and that she has to go because her intellectual disability provider workplace is hosting the show. She said it isn't kid friendly but not really kid adverse either. There will be drinking there but she said she obviously won't be drinking. They will staying at a hotel there. He will be out past 10.

My parents are out of town and can't go get him for me. 

Decree doesn't allow for makeup days so I just lost a day.

177,Help with FBI Case,"I went to US in August 2016 as a Student (F1 Visa) from Asia. After 4 months, I transferred to a school in Texas. In Feb 2017, I met a women who needed some help to extract lost data from her computer, so she said (Remember, I’m not supposed to work legally as I’m on F1 Visa). I (22 years old then) met her around 6 PM, apparently it wasn’t her computer the data was in, it was a website. I told her that can’t be done as we don’t have any access to that website. She told she had to show the data to someone tomorrow morning, and she would pay me $5000 if I can replicate the website and put data on the website, just to show to someone (she was about to lend money from the guy and he had to see data to give her money). So, I got greedy and did the website that was only accessible in that area of Texas and submitted to her the next morning. I took the payment in check, as I couldn’t work, I made her write check on my friend’s name who had Employment Authorisation Documents.

Next thing I know, I was making fake documents for her like electricity bills, phone bills and that kind of stuffs. She used to pay $200 for each bundle and each bundle used to have one electricity bill, phone bill, bank statement, life insurance, house lease document. I did around 10 bundles for her. Then I stopped working for her because we got into a fight as she didn’t pay me for all the work I did for her. Total money I took from her was around $10,000 MAXIMUM.

After 19 months of me replicating that website, I came home one morning (I used to work night shifts in a gas station, still illegal), and found FBI in my house. They were there because I had hacked a government website, or they thought. They were talking about the website I replicated. It was a government website, I didn’t know the time I did that. And, they asked me so many questions, I answered everything honestly and truthfully. They also knew about the documents I faked. They were there with search and seizure warrant so they didn’t take me with them. They thought I hacked their website or created a phishing website to steal money from government and peoples. I told them that wasn’t what the website was for, it was for one girl who wanted to lend money from some guy showing some data and all the data in the website were fake - randomly generated, just to show to the money-giving guy. They definitely thought the case was way bigger than it actually is.

The crimes I did was, replicating website, creating fake documents, working in a gas station. And I thought, in the best case scenario, they’d drop all the case and send me back home as I was working illegally; and worst case scenario, they’d put me in jail, make me pay money and then send me home. So, coming back home was my option. I dropped all my classes and came back home. Please tell me what my options are. I want to complete my studies in the US and, of course, I wouldn’t do any illegal stuffs ever again.

Now, I think the best option for me to do is, go back to US, file asylum, and fight the case and hope for best result. I don’t even know how FBI works. Please Help me find a way to go back to US and live peacefully.

EDIT: When I left the country, I contacted the agent, asked him if I can go back. He said, its okay for me to go because I didn't have any case on me then, and there was nothing stopping me. The case is still processing, I can go there with a new i20 and I already have the visa.

EDIT: The thing is, they had already hacked into all my accounts, they saw everything, all my codes, all the documents I did, etc. They already had everything but they came with search and seizure, took my laptops and phones is all. "
178,"Dog Bite: HVAC ignored k9 warning signs, took money to repair pants","I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog. Big, scary looking, but playful. 

He's gotten his ""one free bite"" out of the way after biting the UPS driver, who also ignored signs and UPS policy, by not leaving packages in the assigned area, which is one the other side of our electric fence. When my dog got close, he hit the dog with a box. Got bit. The dog never bit anyone prior, and we'd had a house with over 100+ construction workers in and our for approximately 6 months, even when we were not home. That went away.

&#x200B;

HVAC tech showed up last week, ignored the big K9 and Dogs Behind Invisible Fence signs, did not call from our driveway, got out of his vehicle, saw the dog, ran, and got nipped on the left calf bad enough to break the skin a little bit. The dog has his shots. 

Animal Control just showed up, issued a citation, told us to put the dog in in house quarantine, and settle this in court. Now this kid who got bit, said he was okay after the bite as he sat in our house, drank our water, and took the $100 offered to pay to replace his jeans. Then we called his employer who sent another tech out. That tech called from the driveway, met the dog, had no problems. And that tech went so far as saying that the kid knew better and should have called from the driveway, himself placing the blame on his counterpart. 

Now when we get to court, I'll be pleading not guilty so that I can question the kid. I did get him on audio saying that he was okay. And I wonder does him accepting the money constitute any fault on him, or relieve any liability on us. The dog is friendly, just huge. And if someone runs, it's his nature to chase and play. My concern is that this is the second time. And the bits have been triggered by an individual. 

Also, both officers from Animal Control did go out of their way to mention the conversation that they had when they pulled up to our house. And they said that because of the neighborhood that we live in, this kid was definitely going to try and sue us. And if the video camera the officer was wearing was indeed switched on, it would have caught those comments. Would that work in our favor? 

Finally, Scout managed to get out of the house, come blazing around the corner, scary looking, only to lick the officers, not bite them. And they can testify to that. But again, does it help. 

He's a very friendly, albeit big dog. Being sued because of his size and our neighborhood is a bit maddening. 

&#x200B;

The UPS driver had a shark, ambulance chaser attorney that tried to sue us for half a million for a nip that barely broke the skin, and the med bills were less than $1200. 

&#x200B;

Does following the law, having signs posted and our dogs fenced mean nothing anymore? Or anything at all? When does the responsibility get placed on people making bad decisions?"

181,"installed software on several PCs to make me a bit of cash, can I get in trouble? [NY]","I would consider myself to be rather skilled when it comes to programming, so I thought it would be a good way to make money. I wrote a couple of scripts to show adverts when people browsed with internet explorer. When they clicked on these ads I'd be paid.

**Note:** this doesn't harm their PCs in any way.

I couldn't think of the best way to get a lot of people to use this software so I began looking at the offices of several medium sized companies. A friend of mine mentioned his office never lock their maintenance door because it is used too often. **He was in no way complicit or new what I was going to do**.

I made sure to drive past the office quite regularly, and decided that Sunday morning would be the best time. So about 2 months ago on a Sunday morning I went inside. **I DID NOT BREAK IN, THEIR DOOR WAS UNLOCKED, I SIMPLY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN**.

I booted up a PC with a live OS from my USB drive and copied the file to the local hard drive, and arranged for a company wide email to be sent out at 10am on Monday with the title ""Office Party"" and had the software in an attachment called ""Party ideas"". When someone opened this file it would bring up a new txt file with a hashmap drawing of a party hat, and underneath it says ""Who's up for a party?"" It would also install the software I wrote in the background. I thought some people might suspect a .exe file attachment was a virus, but if word got around that i brought up a silly picture more people might open it.

Anyway, this brought in a lot more money than I thought it would, there are roughly 500 - 600 employees based at that office, with another smaller office of 200ish people. So the email I sent either went to more than the whole office or people have been spreading it around. Not that I mind of course.

I spoke to my friend again this past Saturday and he said that they've had company wide email about the attachment and that how it's a virus and is being investigated. The poor girl whose PC the emails came from is distraught apparently, and is being accused of going on NSFW websites.

I don't *think* it can be traced back to me, and even if it can I don't think i've actually done anything illegal! Their office was free for me to walk into, there was no keep out signs, and it wasn't even locked! Secondly I've not done any damage to their PCs, it purely shows ads and can be removed by using ""add / remove programs"". It is NOT malicious, it does not copy itself, or try to hide AT ALL.

Do I need a lawyer?

Can I eve get in trouble if I'm caught?

Thanks,

**EDIT:**  Again, I did not break in. I simply walked in. There was no force involved in my entry at all.

**EDIT 2:** Yes you're all very funny. But no-one has provided a valid reason why I could get into trouble for this? It's not like i stole anything, unless you count the air I breathed when I was in the office for fucks sake! Ads aren't evil, it's Google's whole business model!"

We’re pretty convinced that the guy is going to refuse, but we’re hoping he will say yes, and one of the ideas for getting a yes out of the guy is to intimidate him with a false document.

The paper is an order to hand over the dogs, and it comes from a department that doesn’t exist, signed by a person who doesn’t exist. It doesn’t threaten them with imprisonment, and my thought process is that if the department doesn’t really exist, then there’s nothing wrong. Is this legal?"

I know this one didnt get super popular but I did get a resolution and wanted to share.  After a few more phone calls trying to get to the bottom of this latest incident I decided to social engineer a bit and got what i wanted out of the latest incident.

I had set the name of my paypal proxy to something that sounded like a law firm using semi-common last names (eg: Allen, Wells, and Queen LTD) and charged invoiced $500 via debit card.  Once it posted i went into my local branch who I have an okay relationship with to make a withdrawal.  The branch manager has always been on my side with this and saw my transaction and very shyly asked if it was a legitimate transaction because it was outside my spending norm, and i informed her that was my down payment on the retainer to sue FU Bank as I had stated many times in the recent past, that was last wednesday.

Then yesterday I got a call from someone way higher up in the company than i would have expected, this individual is high up enough that their profile and picture is on the banks website.  This person listened to my story from start to end not just on the open issue but my whole experience with the bank.

The resolution we came to included fixing my dispute issue to the original resolution I wanted ($205/479 refunded, originally they gave me 479/479) plus the 2 fees waived as a result of the dispute coming back through.  They also increased my credit line on my credit card with them because they legitimately harmed my credit last summer and ive been very responsible with the card since i opened it.

I will most likely take my business elsewhere, im looking into different checking/savings solutions, but ive been advised by a few people to keep the credit card with them until my credit is more established.

To those in similar situations, One of the posters in the original thread was correct, I should have ended the banking relationship long ago.  The time, effort, and CRAP I endured for this just wasnt worth it."
189,[CA] Have been using my deceased mother's welfare assistance,"Okay to keep this short, my mother died recently (end of February, suicide) and her death has really taken a toll on me, emotionally and financially. I'm the primary survivor who was taking care of all the funeral arrangements. We also received donations but it was cutting it close for the cremation and viewing. She was on welfare (food stamps, cash aid) and I used her card (food stamps) last month to buy groceries. Currently the welfare office doesn't know she is deceased as I am still waiting for the death certificate, to also claim the social security money for her death (only 250 but God knows I need it after everything). I'm wondering, if they notice someone was using her card after her death, will they pursue a case? What would be the chances of them catching me? And if they did, what would I be charged for? (FYI the welfare office doesn't know my current address) 

I've had some experience with the welfare office and opening a case, someone stole my card from me and used my food stamps (renter I was living with) and I asked them to open a case, they said they would but never did. This was last year in July. I'm assuming if I manually reported a card stolen and they never opened a case, the chances of them opening a case for this might be low. Especially because the amount of people on welfare in California is massive and the welfare office is always a shit storm, busy as hell. 

I'm just in a bad spot with my mom gone, and I know some folk will say I shouldn't have used it at all to avoid this situation but if you've ever had to pay for someone's death expenses you'll know how expensive it gets. I needed it. But now I'm worried. Any advice is appreciated. "
190,(NJ) I want my meds back,"I was arrested in NJ for possession of CDS even though I have a prescription for the aforementioned CDS.  I am prescribed 240 a month - I had 2 on me.

Of course, I cited the NJ law that I am entitled to have 2 days worth of meds without a prescription as long as I can identify the pharmacy and doctor, but since the cops have no regard for the law or its statues they arrested me anyway. It's funny how a normal citizen knows more than our brain dead stormtroopers.

So, the charges were dropped and I want my meds back. Do I just go back to the police station?  I'm scared if I go pick it up, they will give it to me and then arrest me all over again just to be dicks.  I don't have the original physical perscritption - only the pharmacy receipt.  It's obviously legitimate though because both Superior and Municipal called my doc and verified it.

So, what should I do?  I dont really want to contact my lawyer and get juiced more money but I want my meds back.  Even though it's only 2 pills, its the point that they are mine, they were illegally confiscated and I want them back.

193,Elderly Patient in Severe Pain Denied Meds by 3 Doctos,"*Doctors

New York

I’ll try to make this short and It’ll make more sense why I’m even asking at the end.

My dad is 64 and has been on methodone for 30 years after becoming addicted to prescription opiates due to chronic pain from Hep C.

He hasn’t once come up with an opiate hot urine in the 30 years of being on the program and I state this because although methadone is typically used to treat addicts (which he was) it was due to trying to alleviate chronic pain.

Anyway, he recently hurt his back. He’s having unbearable sciatic nerve pain which is keeping him awake for days at a time. He has been to a local urgent care, the ER and his primary which all refuse to prescribe pain medication due to him being on methadone. 

He is allowed 2 weeks of take home bottles of methadone on his treatment program, because he was in so much pain he drank twice his daily dose and essentially ran out a week early. He was heavy into withdrawl 2 days ago and called his methadone clinic who couldn’t take him til today. 

The clinic has suspended his take homes obviously for violating the the policy and taking more than prescribed. So, he’ll be forced to go there every morning now, while in severe pain. The doctor there stated they can’t give him anymore methadone until Monday (because that’s when he was due for a refill) and the same doctor also stated it may potentially be illegal to have been denied pain meds solely based on the fact that he was on methadone and obviously and undeniable in pain. X-rays have shown 3 fractured discs which are believed by not sure to be from past injuries and clearly he has some type of pinched sciatic nerve based on the pain. 

My question is, is what his methadone doctor stated in fact true? Can he legally be denied any type of pain medication for being a patient of methadone as well? Also, like wtf? Our healthcare system is so fucked. Any advice would be appreciated!

Side Note: Thanks alot Doc, had to go buy some illegal oxys off the street just to get my dad out of fucking pain.

EDIT: I came here for legal advice, not to be harassed with unhelpful and derogatory comments. I doubt any of you people are even lawyers or involved with the law given how vague and ambiguous your ""advice"" was."
195,Mild child abuse?,"A friend of mine was caught doing something that her parents disapproved of (it wasn’t anything illegal). As punishment, her parents decided to refuse her food or water starting from 3:00 PM to around 9 or 10 PM that day. I know this may seem mild but the friend was continuously telling me she was very hungry and had to sneak away a cup of water when she got too thirsty. She says this is the first time they’ve done this and that they apologized afterwards. I just need to know if this is something I should report or not. Thank you for taking the time to read this; I hope it doesn’t sound like a dumb question.

EDIT: Thank you all for reassuring me this definitely *does* sound like a dumb question.

Also, I suppose this bit wasn’t made clear enough but a major concern of mine was that I did not know when she had last eaten or had water beforehand; the punishment simply started at 3:00. It was evident by her stealing of water that she had not had water quite a while before 3:00.

Also, I have learned that she only had a banana that morning which may have been cause for the hunger complaints.

Nevertheless, it seems this is something that does not call for a report to CPS. Thank you for your answers."
196,UPDATE: My Son's School is Enforcing a Discriminatory Dress Code,"Previously, when I explained the school's discriminatory dress code - ""Boys hair cannot be longer than their shirt collar,"" the reddit community was a huge help. Thanks to everyone for their feedback and input. This is in the Southern District of Texas (USA) at an anonymous school in an anonymous school district. There are 500 of 1276 school districts (40%) that continue to enforce a discriminatory dress code despite not providing a justification.

We reviewed the school policy and legal cases, prepared an argument, and submitted a grievance with the administration. We cited the school policy which prohibits discrimination and even pointed to the section of the school policy which forbids harassment of students based on gender stereotypes or students not conforming to gender stereotypes as well as Title IX. Apparently that portion of the student policy and Federal legislation is not as important as ""asserting authority"" and ""identifying students that don't belong in the community.""

At the recommendation of our fellow redditors, we talked with an ACLU attorney and a local family law attorney who both said, the school has made it impossible to stop the hair policy and the costs to fight in court would be extraordinarily prohibitive. The policy specifically states, anyone not in compliance with the dress code will be placed on In School Suspension (ISS) during the grievance process and will remain in ISS until their hair is in compliance. At our grievance meeting the principal emphasized that the school response to the grievance would take the full 10 business days, during which time the student will remain in ISS. We requested an exemption and the principal informed us that he was the one who approved exemptions, that there were only religious or cultural exemptions, and that we would not qualify for an exemption under any circumstances.  Our son has had to drop one course already because he could not attend mandatory peer group meetings, missing those mandatory meetings last week meant that he could not achieve a passing grade in the course.

We ask for your support as we will be reaching out to the school board next. If you have any background information that supports our arguments against discriminatory school dress codes, you can help with a case citation and a short summary. Try not to duplicate cases that have already been cited, although a reply if the analysis is off or if their are additional points to ponder would be very helpful. If the case is no longer precedential, that information would also be helpful. Additionally, any research or articles that review the effects of either hair cut  or ISS policies. I am looking for information and citations I can cut and paste into an appeal.

The haircut is not trivial for us, our son has been growing his hair for 5 years. His hair is literally midway down his back (24 inches). He cannot cut it now and grow it back next summer, this portion of his identity will be permanently removed and cannot be replaced.  Growing it back again after high school will likely not achieve the same look and style.

Thank you Reddit community for your support - see you in the comments."
197,19 year old charged with DUI (Idaho),"I was arrested last night for a misdemeanor DUI and misdemeanor open container. I am a first time offender aside from speeding tickets. I blew a 0.160. I was not rude or an ass in any way. I was respectful throughout the whole ordeal and made sure I made the officers job as easy as possible. I am worried that I will lose my license and in turn lose my job and also not be able to attend college because of this. Is it worth getting a lawyer? Will getting a lawyer help me with hopefully getting the DUI charge expunged or dropped? 
Edit: I am going to an attorney tomorrow morning to consult with them"
198,Can i (17f) get fired in Texas for disclosing my sexuality/talking about my partner with kids that I work with.,"So i live in the suburbs near houston and I would say my community is fairly split between conservative and liberal.  However, I still live in texas and we all know Texas isn't the most gay-friendly state.  I work at a gym teaching young kids (5-15ish) gymnastics.  As a coach i often develop close relationships w my kids (not in a weird way i just love them and care for them), and they will constantly ask me questions about my personal life.  They've asked me if I have a boyfriend, who I'm going to prom with, and who has the other half of a ""friendship"" keychain I have, and I'm always honest with them and tell them I have a girlfriend.  I won't give them details (they've asked if we've kissed before, if I'd marry a girl, etc.) but I won't lie.  I've almost never brought it up myself (there's a group of 11-15 year olds who I told without being prompted, but they were having a conversation about lesbians so I chimed in) and only tell them about my girlfriend if they ask.  I'm worried someone might tell their parents and bring it up to my management.  Is it legal for me to talk to kids about it?  Is it legal for my managers to tell me not to talk about it?  I don't want to get fired or face but I also don't want to work somewhere where I'm discriminated against, even if it's for my own protection.  All of my coworkers that know are totally cool with it (or at least I think they are and I don't really care if they don't) and I've never tried to hide it or lie, but I don't think I've explicitly told my manager or the owner of the gym.  Thanks in advance!"

200,[NJ] Fired for calling the cops,"I work in a closing retail store, today was our last day and members of management and some of the other associates, including underage girls, talked often about drinking once we had closed our doors. I voiced my opinion multiple times about it being a bad idea as they obviously have to drive home afterwards. During the course of the day I did indeed found alcohol which I moved in an effort to keep them from drinking and driving. Once we did close however it seems one associate still have alcohol on their person and they were all intending to do shots before leaving. I again iterated how this was a bad idea before leaving. I wound up calling the cops to come check it out and I am being fired as a result. I should mention that there is still 2 weeks of cleaning and removing stuff from the store. Should I speak to an employment lawyer?"
201,Father charged me with credit card theft with card HE gave me.,"Long story short, my Father's a multi-millionaire, sperm donor, piece of sh!t. I graduated high school and began University. My Father always promised as long as I maintained good grades and stayed out of trouble, my college and expenses would be taken care of. Fast forward into my sophomore year, my Mother divorced him. In retaliation to my mother, not only did my Father drop his financial obligation (that he promised) he accused me of credit card theft on a card he provided me. The card I was issued had a infinite limit on it. My Father cut off all financial help and left me entirely destitute. In vengeance and great regret, I paid my vehicle (which was in his name) off  and my college tuition on the credit card for that semester which totaled $30,000. 

It's been 12 years of hell and oppression. Im a 32 year old, single female that have made pretty decent decisions with my life and have no other convictions of ANY sort. NOT even traffic violations. I've battled guilt and humiliation from being a felon on paper. 

I was placed on deferred adjudication with 3 years probation. I was released a year and a half early for good behavior. I filed an order for non-disclosure it was granted in 2016. Its been 10 years since the arrest date.

Can anybody chime in on what my record may look like now? Does it show that it was deferred or is it entirely sealed. Much Love and thanks"
202,[MA] BANNED FROM SMASH BROS,"I was BANNED from my local super smash bros melee scene. They use the local community college to host this and TOLD ME BY EMAIL IF I CAME THERE THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME IN. This was out of nowhere so I immediately called the TO, who told me why. He said it was because I was frequently toxic and angry. He said that I yell at players and make them uncomfortable and scared, and that a girl quit because of me. While I DO sometimes get frustrated and vocalize it, so do many other people I am simply being discriminated against my voice is naturally deeper than most. also the truth is a girl never quit that is a complete lie, she was just butthurt that she was worst than everyone there. I'm so fucking irate. I've been a member of this community FOR YEARS and just now I'm a nuisance? I am entitled to a certain level of RESPECT for being a veteran player. I'm looking into finding a lawyer who get me unbanned. There MUST be a law that prevents people from arbitrarily banning others from certain locations without written documents proving it (the TO just SAID I was banned he did not provide any evidence.) The TO isn't rich or anything so I don't think I would have to ask a lot from him, I think he'd break under just pressure of lawsuit. "
203,Is it legal to lure Amish children into a van and let them play video games?,"If all you do with the kids when you have them in the van is let them play video games and you allow them to leave whenever they want, is that legal?

204,How can I manuver my way into getting my dad's apartment before my mother? (NYC),"Hi everybody. Throwaway account for privacy reasons. I'm going to make this short and brief. 

My mother has been a constant toxic presence in my life. She has had things handed to her for most of her life and doesn't understand the value of money. It's because of this - combined with a plethora of other reasons - that I don't want her in my life anymore. 

My father's name is on the lease and is the only one on the lease. He claims that it was impossible to add my mother's name in the past which is why it's only him. 

He left my mother after putting up with her bullshit for over 20 years and does not plan on paying the rent for her to stay. He will however pitch in so I can stay - and we both want the apartment to become mine.

I've tried to speak with her reasonably and told her that it's only logical for me to get the apartment since I have a stable job and she doesn't. She also has other options like moving in with my brother who needs a caregiver for his children, or moving back to Dominican Republic and live in house my father had built. She then told me that according to a government representative she spoke to earlier on the phone, she has a right to stay in the apartment even if she doesn't pay the rent because she's been here for decades and since she can't pay the rent due to ""circumstances"" the government will cover her. 
 
I looked up options for me and ""succession rights"" popped up but I have no idea where to start. I want to cover my tracks and make sure that I do this as fast as possible so I can legally kick her out and move on with my life. 

If this post is too short I will be more than happy to edit it and dive into all the little details. I honestly have no experience or knowledge of the law besides the bare minimum so I don't even know what information you guys might need in this situation. 

Thanks.

Sorry for format and any grammatical errors - I'm on mobile. 

Edit #1: I forgot to mention that my mother forgot her documents (permanent resident card and other important documents) in a bank and took over a month to get them back which resulted in them getting destroyed. Is it possible that she can get deported if I decide to take her to court?

Edit #2: I cannot afford the rent by myself - I plan on having a roommate come live with me. As a result I can't have my mother living here anymore. So it's not just that I don't want to live with her anymore even though I don't - it's also that I can't. "
205,Two women at work dislike one of the owners so they want to unionize to push their personal agendas. Should I talk to the owners? How can I protect my job?,"I live in Europe (Spain). Small company (18 employees) on IT. I’ve been here for 5 years, have a good salary, and I really enjoy my job. I’m also about to buy a house here, so things are going great.

Two women joined us less than two years ago and came from big companies. They came to work with us so they could stay close to their homes and “settle”. They are both kind of slow and, sorry to say it, bad at their job. One of them is even aware of it and purposely decided to avoid learning. Both of them had a bad time with one of the two partners (owners), so they both fought to get re-assign to work far from him.

In my country, after a certain number of employees, we can unionize; we actually choose a union rep internally and formalize the new state of affairs within the company. Because of their troubles fitting in, these two want to proceed with the union and use the new state of affairs to ask from the partners a bunch of crap that’s just gonna cause trouble.

The real reasn is that they want to take power away from them so that the new “order” can benefit their way of working instead of trying to fit the company culture. 

They both work 5 min away from the office, but they want “flexible hours” so they can come in at 8 and get out at 17 (instead of 9-18); they want the option to work remotely one day a week; they want to review tons of comapny rules that are clear just for the sake of it, etc.

And to top it off, one of them said that “the idea is to tell the owners that they can no longer manage the company the way they once did”. They basically want to take control away from the partners, protecting themselves from getting fired and chsnging somethin that works but doesn’t suit their vision.

Now, hear me out. The workplace is great and the partners are always flexible and accomodating to reasonable requests. These two wanna use us (employees) as a shield to get back at one of the partners for “not treating them as well as a they deserve”, to the point of accusing one of being mysogynistic (50% of employees are women, only these two accuse him of that).

All of this is gonna cause trouble, and I won’t back them up in any way. In fact, I talked to the poster-girl the other day and played it dumb in order to find out what she wanted to do. She opened up, and I proceeded to tear down (diplomatically) all her stupid requests and explained why those would cause more harm than good, given, btw, that one of them was working from home while she lived at 5 fucking minutes from there...

Entitlement was everywhere. They just don’t get that they can’t do this without tearing down the good thing that we have at the moment, and the fact the two most useless team members are promoting this is a huge red flag. Why do I have to shit on the partners’ trust so that whinny coworker and useless employee can feel “respected as people” and screw off at home one day a week?

As expected, they vented like crazy behind my back afterwards. I want this job, I don’t want two of essentially newcommers to ruin this, so what should I do? Should oppose them openly? Should I warn the partners so they can divide them or take some sort of action? Again, I don’t want that these two cause enough mayhem a that my job is somehow compromised.

One of them, btw, admitted that “she wouldn’t really starve if she wasn’t working”, meaning she can affort to act like this.

Finally, the situation with the partners is as follows: owner A (really socialist, gave these two women tons of chances to fit in) told me in the past not to talk about employees issues with owner B, as he would overreact. Owner B (hardass, down to business kind of guy, less of a people’s person, wants people to work and do a good job) is the guy these two women have issues with.

My options are:

**a)** talk to partner A and risk inaction. He would let this be, in my opinion, long enough for it to become a problem.

**b)** talk to partner B, put things into motion and risk pisisng off the other guy by “defying” him and his decision.

**c)** set up a meeting with both and tell them I have serious information regarding the company and the future of it, and that I will share it with them both if that’s what they want.

The problem is not the union, and the woman in charge already requested the owners for office space to meet, so it’s in the open. The problem is that she admitted in private that she’s doing it to take power away from them and change things to fit their vision, and the owners don’t know this.

First union meeting is in about two weeks. How would you protect yourself against this? How would you stop these women from using a perfectly valid tool (the union) to ruin something good (our job)?"
206,"Charged with a felony, will it stick?","  I was pulled over out of town for “speeding” by a K-9 unit. (I wasn’t speeding, our car reads speed limit signs), but in addition to that, the officer said our 30-day plate numbers weren’t legible. (They were, plate is in perfect condition). As soon as they pulled us, they come to the car, and made us step out of the car in freezing weather, and stand behind our car in the parking lot.

  About 15 minutes pass, I call my mom and let her know what’s going on, after 5 more minutes, officers get out and tell me to place my hands behind my back, and that I’m under arrest for a Communicating Threats charge (no warrant) from my home town. I was and still am genuinely confused, as I don’t know who took these papers on me. I have the name of the person, but I don’t know them.

  Anyways, 3 more police cars pull up, they pat me down, take my phone (which is still on call with my mother). They come back to me in the back of the police car, and tell me “I’m a K-9 Unit, and I am going to do a routine K-9 search on the vehicle, if he hits, we are searching it, okay?” & I don’t respond. Long story short, they search the car, find a “substance” where I was sitting, and another where my bf was sitting. They open the hood, trunk, all doors, and tear it apart, and find nothing else.

  At this point, my mother is still listening in, officers do not realize. They speak to my boyfriend, and once she hears them speaking very suspiciously, she starts recording the call from her end. The officers are speaking about who will testify to what, and at one point, the main officer says “I’ll testify to (xxx), we will say we pulled them because of this, and I’ll say I was driving, because I REALLY was driving”. It’s very suspicious, and it’s all on recording. They intentionally left their body cameras off, and on the recording, the main officer says “okay, turn your body cam on now”. 

  At this point, they come to me, still in the car, tell me they’re charging me with Felony Possession, read me my rights, then ask me what the substance is, and try to get me to incriminate myself through empathy, saying “we need to know what it is, so we don’t hurt ourselves”. I tell them, being the empath that I am, “I don’t know what it is, but don’t touch it. I take full responsibility for anything in the vehicle” he asks me the same question again, I respectfully decline to answer anymore questions without my attorney present. Officer says “well that answers that” laughs, and slams the door in my face.

  In the recording, just after this, he claims I admitted it was “dope” by telling them not to touch it. They take me to the magistrate, and leave me in the car for close to an hour, then the magistrate comes out, reads me my bond, and charges, then I’m taken to jail and booked. Any advice on this? Body cams intentionally left off during search, officers conspiring with the body cams off, pulling us over without any real reason.

EDIT: I’d also like to add, me and my boyfriend are in our 20’s, don’t look like criminals, weren’t driving a suspicious looking vehicle."
207,Is it worth it to do a private polygraph in the hopes of avoiding arrest?,"Colorado

Personally, I think polygraphs are bullshit, but I am being pressured to do one with a detective. The detective claims that if I pass, he won’t charge me with an alleged crime.

212,Repo guy harassing my 12 year old at our front door?,"To start we are located in WI.
My 12 year old son takes band class at his school. He is in percussion and required a bell kit to keep at home for practice. Through a local music store they rent them out (rent to own basically) and we had been making payments (automatic) every month. We knew we only had a few payments left to make before it was paid off in full. We received zero monthly statements from the company, and we never really thought anything about the payments stopping because we thought it had been paid off. Again- nothing ever came in the mail. I never answer my cell phone to numbers I don’t recognize because of scam/telemarketing etc. so if they called I wouldn’t have answered. (Leave  a message if you know me. I had not received any emails from the music store, and if did they went to spam and I never saw them. 
Which brings us to about 15min ago. I had just gotten out of the shower and the doorbell rings. My son is home because there is a school snow day because of the weather. He answers the door and a man is asking for me. My son says I’m not available and the man took a sarcastic tone like”Oh really, are you sure about that?”
Again- I had just stepped out of the shower so I can hear the whole exchange. This man then asks “are you xxx?” I was shocked a stranger knew my kid’s name. My son said yes, and the man told him that I had not been paying the company for the bell kit, and went into details that I couldn’t hear- but it was obviously something a 12 year old would not know about financially etc. My son told him he thought it was paid off and the man starts writing down my son’s “statement” (his words) and said that he was going to have to go back to the store to see if that was true or not. He then said “xxxx, this is the part of my job I hate, but we are now considering this as theft and I will be reporting your mother to the Sheriff’s office.” My 12 year old just stood there shellshocked, and the man said he was taking his statement to the store and if it didn’t check out the sheriff was going to be contacted. To add insult to injury- my son knows this man as he is the school’s band substitute teacher and sees him frequently. 
I called my husband at work and told him what had just happened- and he immediately called the music store and paid the bill in full. I am thinking the card used for autopay had expired, and all they needed was a new card number. Shouldn’t they have contacted us by mail? And is it even legal to confront a 12 yr old and tell him basically his mom was going to be charged for theft and to expect a Sheriff’s officer to come to the house? My  son is traumatized, I am livid and my husband chewed out the store about not contacting by mail. (He did not mention the part about the information being passed to a child.)
Do I drop it for the sake that my son has to interact frequently with this man or is there action I should take?
In my mind if they tried to get ahold of me by phone and left no messages, and emails I didn’t get- anything that would have had the law on their side would have to be letter by mail, which was never done. To confront a 12 yr old at our house is unacceptable to me and I want to know if he was in the legal right to do so. 

Edit: Thanks for the answers! I would never dispute or not make a payment for something I clearly owe money for. I wouldn’t care if it was 5 cents- it is my responsibility and clearly through an oversight we dropped the ball. I have never had a late payment on anything as I always use auto payment straight from our account. I just would have thought a letter in the mail would have brought it to our attention instead of a home visit...which is fine if that is how they choose to proceed- I was miffed that my son was involved and that’s why I was a bit taken aback. Now I know that it is within their right- I’ll just go back to being mortified that this happened at all, and make sure all debit cards that we have for auto pay are up to date. I appreciate the responses!"
213,Am I legally obligated to pay for a credit card that I was forced to open against my will?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 21 y/o college student with no credit, last time I checked-- or possibly bad credit, now, after having been delinquent on my old apt's electric bill now for a few months (I heard utilities don't count towards credit?) and this situation with a credit card. I am mostly asking about the credit card because I'm embarrassed and no one knows the truth and I don't know what to do-- I relapsed after a few years off of street drugs last year and in November my dealer took me, intoxicated, to Home Depot where he forced me to go inside and use all my real information to apply for an on-the-spot credit card. LUCKILY I was only approved for $500 since I am a 21 y/o with no credit (wahoo!) He proceeded to use the temporary card (the paper receipt) and my signature to max out all $500 on it so he could put it towards a fridge or whatever while he gave me drugs to keep me occupied and get high in the bathroom so I stayed under the influence, roaming around the store after consenting to I guess and showing them my ID for the transaction. All I remember was that we were in that store for hours.. This is both embarrassing and shameful on my part and no one knows that it happened. Now the Home Depot wants min. payment of $25 a month and I was going to call them to explain how I was forced to do this (he had a gun) but I'm not willing to take it to the police (I can't even track down the dealer) and just don't want any trouble. I'm thinking at this point it may just be easier to pay for the $500 balance, with this first payment having been received late, and since I truly did walk into the store and open the card with my ID, my social, my everything, I legally gotta pay and it's just a consequence of my usage. On the other hand, someone theoretically could have walked into the store with my documents and info that looked like me? Can anyone advise? Thanks very much and I apologize if this is in the wrong sub! EDIT: This happened in Philly, PA but I'm from Boston with a Mass ID and address."

215,"[MA] Landlord has my last month rent (no security) and sends me message: ""there is a problem, you smoked in the apartment, only way to fix it is changing carpets and repainting walls. How do you intend to solve the problem?""","I had a 9 months lease with my landlord and moved out early, after agreeing with him that I would have honored my rental obligations until a new tenant was found. He does have my last month rent, no security deposit, and I do have written proof of it on my contract. I did pay the rent of what turned out to be the last month because I did not know when a new tenant would show up. 


The realty company found a new tenant from April 1st, and I have already vacated the apartment. Today my landlord sent me a text message saying that there is a problem, I smoked in the apartment (the lease says not to) and the only way to fix it is changing carpets and repainting the walls. He asks me how do I intend to deal with the problem. I am yet to reply deciding what my best course of action is. I assume he entered the apartment without giving me any notice, and technically I paid the rent until the end of the month. I washed the apartment quite thoroughly (all surfaces disinfected, floors cleaned, carpets vacuumed twice).


And yes, I did smoke (tobacco) in the apartment in the last months. But (a) I'm a light smoker, maybe smoked 10 cigarettes in the last month in there; (b) have not been smoking in the apartment at all for at least a week. (so there is no objective damage like stains on the walls or similar). I did cook in there on a daily basis and even burned a few steaks in case it counts, lol. 


My current plan of action is to give him a call, not admitting to smoking in the apartment (but just outside the door - maybe that is what he smells? Lease does not prohibit me from stepping outside the house to smoke, that is actually what my landlord suggested when I moved in) but offering to shampoo the carpets and wash the walls if he deems it appropriate. 


He has no proof (that I can think of) of my smoking, plus it is my understanding that he cannot use my last month as security, and must return it to me within 30 days of my move.

I think he wants to keep my money, and generally speaking, I'd prefer to solve the thing amicably rather than going to court. What do you advise? Thanks!



Edit: This is how it rolled out. 


I talked to my landlord, offered alternatives (with links to sources) to repainting the whole house, and he accepted to give it a try. I deep washed the carpets and washed the walls, by hand, with a solution of ammonia, white vinegar, washing soda and warm water. 


He looked at the place a few days after I was done, said all was well, and gave me back my money. 


Total cost: 60$ for Dr. Rug and related washing soaps; ~40$ of ammonia, vinegar and bleach resistant cloth for the walls and ~12 hours of my time.

216,"""Nightmare house guest"" or ""Sexually Abused Female Victim Trapped In A House""","HELP! I am a 30 year old, in California homeless sexually abused female with no money and no family. I have been abused my entire life on and off by many different men, including my own father. 

In the beginning of January someone who I considered a friend allowed me to stay at his house. Almost immediately, he began to rub my breasts and buttocks. I told him not to touch me but he continued. I tried to keep it to myself thinking that he was only being affectionate and maybe I shouldn't be such a prude. Around the beginning of February, whenever he moved close to me, I would quickly find something to do, usually cleaning common spaces such as the kitchen and dining area, which I kept spotless for the most part. He became visably upset that I'd walk away from him and began to isolate me inside the house. The house is very far away from public transit and I have no car. He made sure to conveniently forget to take me grocery shopping or into the city for appointments. I was trapped in the house for 3 weeks straight, terrified that he would come into the room and try to rape me or worse. He triggered a horrible PTSD panic attack within me by leaving his used sex toys out in the bathroom. After this, I didn't leave the bedroom unless it was an emergency. As a defense mechanism, whenever I feel as though I am in danger I always make a barricade around myself and my sleeping area out of my belongings. It's my own secret trap meant to literally trip up potential assailants because they wouldn't know the terrain but I would so I would be able to escape easily while my abuser got stuck.

I was convinced by an ex-mutual friend to speak to him again about my boundaries. When I did he purposely triggered my PTSD and called the police to have me 5150'd... during my time under doctor supervision (3 days) I was informed that I was suffering from a light mood disorder but my real problem was my sexually abusive living situation... After I got out, I was informed that he was either thinking of or already in the process of filing a restraining order and police report on me. For what reasons, I had no idea at the time because I had never done anything other than be kind and shut my mouth about his sexual abuse... But then I saw this post on imgur... http://imgur.com/a/pXOtw

Most of the things in the captions are false. The weed bag was planted and I NEVER harmed any of the animals... He hurt the animals himself in order to blame me!!! This is HORRIBLE! Not only is he trying to hurt me now he's hurting innocent creatures!!!

I already filed a police report as soon as I got out of the psychiatric ward/crisis center/whatever as well as a restraining order... but I believe he might have pressed false charges on me while I was under 5150 and had three days of my life stolen.

What can I do in this situation??? He's going out of his way to create false evidence and physically hurt others in order to bring me down... I don't know what to do and I don't have the money... PLEASE help!!!

EDIT: I already moved out. I need serious help sorting through the legal bullshit. Also this is what the 5150 release paperwork said that I suffer from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia

217,I think my grandma killed my dad,"Not a troll post 

So when I was 10 my dad died, I'm now 19 and I am thinking of taking legal action to find out the truth. 3 days after my 10 birthday my mom got a call saying my dad died. My sister 11 at the time, her and my mom went over to my grandmother's house the day after it happened ( my dad died at her house). My sister 11 went in alone she said she saw pills all over the house and our grandma was grabbed my sister and tried telling her our mom was the reason our dad died/ committed suicide. The day before our dad's funeral my other sister we will call her k, so k and our grandma went to the funeral home to see the body and everything. Our grandma took k by the hand and made her touch our dad's body even tho she didn't want to, and the day of the funeral me and my sister went allowed to the funeral because our mom was with us and I feel like I was wronged I was only 10 and my dad dies and telling us we can't go because you don't want our mom there really messed me up. So a few years pass and I ask my sister what happened. So k told me that our dad hung himself with our grandma's belt in the living room by the door while our grandma was in the shower not even 15 feet away, that detail always stuck by me. Shortly after dad died our grandmother sold all of our dad's stuff in a yard sale and we don't have any keep sakes from him. We cut off all contact from her and moved around a lot, when I turned 18 I learned that I got money from my dad's death and I couldn't get it because my grandma wouldn't give it to up in the mail or anything and I'm wanting legal advice on what I should do. I want the truth on my dad's death."

219,Employer Trying to Charge for Classes After Putting in Two Weeks,"Hi All,

Michigan:

I recently put in my two weeks notice at my job and got an email from HR saying I was going to be charged for a six sigma course I had taken in 2018 because I had not completed 12 months of consecutive employment after completing the training.

The clause in the contract they are referring to is this:

**If you voluntarily terminate employment with *company name* after completion of the course and prior to completing 12 consecutive months of active employment, you will refund the entire amount of the training expenses provided to you**

To me this does not specify that the 12 months had to be after the training was completed and I meet this requirement as I have worked for the company for over 2 years.

What should my next moves be?

**UPDATE:** I found a section in the employee handbook that says **""The educational assistance program applies to individuals who have been employed with *company name* for a continuous 2,000 hours of service (approximately 1 year.)**

It says nothing about employment requirements after the course is completed. Does this not further reinforce my position?

**UPDATE 2: I was able to negotiate with them to reduce the amount to 25% of the original amount, thank you to everyone who didnt down vote me into oblivion.**"
220,Coworker who was having visa issues was promoted for a project I mostly implemented. My promotion was delayed.,"So I have a coworker who partnered with me on a major project and did about 25% of the work (He came into the project late).  We are in the same role and rank but I have been with the company for a bit longer.  I also led said project.

I recently learned he was having visa issues and could no longer stay in the US so they made a higher level job for him in our Canada office.  I was also told that my promotion process which was scheduled for this year was being delayed until next year.  When management announced his promotion they mentioned this project.  I am a US citizen and don't need a visa.

I brought this up to my manager and he said it's concerning but unrelated as they had to do something to keep him employed. But it doesn't mean that *I* deserve a promotion.  He said that I was a better performer but this decision wasn't performance related it was just a lucky draw because of his situation.  He also said that visas are really hard to deal with and that it's harder being an immigrant so I don't have the same problems as he does.  I got a bit emotional and teary eyed over this so I just asked to talk about it next week and he offered to see if the promotion could be moved up to this year.

Is this legal at all?   It's frustrating doing all this work and then seeing someone else get a promotion.  I agree with the attempt to keep him but it came at my expense.

222,"On Mental Health Probation in Lawrence, Kansas. My judge just told me i cannot take kratom or ANY vitamins or supplements (even vitamin c) and they are coming to my house to confiscate them. This was not in the probation contract i signed","First off, I already told my psychiatrist, my therapist, and my primary care doc that I was taking kratom and they were totally fine with it. 

Kratom has helped me get off methadone, I have bulging disks in my lower back and sometimes I can't even get up or move around without kratom. I was even told to stop taking VITAMINS. she said i am not allowed to take ANY HERBAL SUPPLEMTNS. This was not in my original contract for probation,
and in fact, goes directly against a group therapy I go too (court ordered) where they gave me a huge bottle of fish oil and am supposed to take it regularly. well now, just on a whim, i cant. 

i have not been failing UAs, ive done everything i was asked to do except i missed like 2 meetings or came late, no excuse but I have severe insomnia and sometimes cant stay awake during the day because I cant sleep at night. They said my next step will be some sort of impatient treatment. which is bullshit. theres so much i have to do including get ready for a job and other things.

they are on their way now to CONFISCATE my kratom. I told them I will do so much worse if they make me stop. they didnt care. They are literally doing this on a whim, claiming that since ive been taking kratom ive been way out of sorts and cant function. ive been taking it for three years. you know my im out of sorts? because i have PTSD, anxiety they wont give me anything useful for, insomnia and my meds dont help, i have nightmares everynight and im fatigued alot. kratom is one of the only things that keeps me STABLE through all that. they are making a huge, possible even illegal mistake. so can i eat a fucking salad? thats a plant too. can i not eat chili with any herbs or spices in it? so no more melatonin, or fish oil that the same judge sent me to where the group told me to take it. 

this goes against literally everything that mental health treatment has told me so far. I cant even take VITAMIN C?!?

and they think this is going to help me? kratom is like the only thing that gets my by each day.

this CANNOT be legal? how can I fight this? my lawyer isnt really doing anything to help. should i contact the ACLU?"

I sent her photos of my self and she said I crossed the line. But read it a sort of joking way. Sent other pics and there was no reply for days. 

I went to her floor and she was not there. So I tried calling and texting multiple times with no answer. I finally get a message from her saying she is going to HR and will be speaking to a lawyer.

Is this a thing? We are arguing it wasn't child endangerment because his daughter was buckled in and sitting in the backseat. I haven't heard how his meeting with his lawyer went, but it seems ridiculous they would even attempt to charge him with this.

228,"My roommate changed internet password and refuses to give it up, need help asap","Hey all

I have unfortunately gotten my self into a situation with a roommate who is honestly both the dumbest person I’ve ever met and also the pettiest. 

I signed an agreement on may 9th because I was in a situation with my ex girlfriend where I had to move out asap and this is the only place I could find kn short notice that was within budget as well as cat friendly. 

I signed an agreement to pay half utilities and half internet as well has half rent which was 1300 supposedly. 

Fast forward to July 8th there is a late payment notice on the door. I had paid my half of the rent early as she had asked, and asked her if everything was ok. She said she was figuring it out, and I offered to pay the remainder of what she didn’t have so the rent would be paid which was $200. 

I was supposed to leave july 21st to NY so I asked her if she had enough to cover her half of the rent for august. Apparently that was crossing a line. I then asked to see the bills for the past 3 months as she never requested a payment, and also a copy of the lease

Turns out the lease isn’t in her name. It’s her ex boyfriends. I know. Silly me. I also find out that rent is only $1260 so I’ve been paying $20 more every month. So she owes me $260 which I told her to deduct the cost of the power and internet which from the bills j received was roughly $358 total. So $184 each? Idk whatever

Basically I’ve found a new place that’s available September 1st. My agreement is supposed to go til October 31st but one of the stipulations is paying the rent on time which she did not do. She also lied about the cost of the apartment. 

So, having to had stayed another month unfortunately, we’ve agreed I’ll be out of here by 9/9. And then this bitch decides to change the password on the internet, even though I’ve gone out of my way to avoid her petty bullshit. 

So I took the router and locked it in my room and told her that She can either pay me back the money I’m owed or give me the password. She’s threatening to call the police and I said that’s fine. 

Am I legally allowed to do this? I’ve technically paid my half of power and internet and this has now put me in position where 8 of my guppies have died since the smart plug it was attached to was on the wifi, and when she cut the internet the heater went out. 

What do???"
229,"(Dallas, TX) Caught flipping tips at work, fled the state, all of my belongings are...","DALLAS, TX

So. I did a dumb thing and started fluffing tips at work (""accidentally"" entering an extra 0 on a $1.00 tip etc...) - I was caught apparently. My managers put me on the schedule for a weird ass time, and I got a few text messages from coworkers warning me they planned to call for my arrest me when I came in.

So... I panicked and fled out of state to stay with a friend. I am currently home & jobless though for now I have food and shelter. I'm applying for jobs as well.

My questions are:

1) What am I looking at if I returned to Dallas and faced the music? How much money / jail time etc... ? What factors play into this? Assume my old employer actually went through with pressing charges I guess. I'd really rather just deal with this honestly, though depending on the consequences that may not be my best option yeah?

2) Is not facing the music a realistic option? Like how does having a warrant out for you across state borders play out? Is there a way for me to find out if I actually have one out for me? 

3) Say I returned to Dallas, briefly, to retrieve my things - what is the likelihood of me being caught and arrested if I were to fly in? If I drove in?

4) ...any references on some way to hire a retrieval service to get my shit for me? Assuming I couldn't go myself.

I regret my decision, obviously. It's not like I was stealing for the thrill or for fun, I was stealing cause grocery money. I was and am effectively homeless, have been for quite some time.

230,To Pepper Spray a Pit Bull or Not to Pepper Spray a Pit Bull,"Several months ago my 18 lb dog was attacked by an 80 lb pit bull.  The pit bull picked him up in his mouth, but luckily did not bite down.  Since then I started carrying pepper spray.  Yesterday I was walking my dog and noticed a guy about 200 feet away telling is dog to ""stay here with me.""  I was walking on a sidewalk that would take me within about 20 feet of where they were standing.  I picked up my dog and continued walking.  As I approached the pit bull began to pull the man towards me.  I pulled out my pepper spray and yelled ""DO NOT LET THAT DOG GET CLOSE TO ME.""  Sadly, the dog did not understand a word I said, and continued pulling the man closer to me.  When they were within about 4 feet I gave them one last warning, ""GET THAT DOG AWAY FROM ME OR I'M GOING TO SPRAY HIM!!!!""  Finally the dog stopped pulling.  We were able to escape without spraying the dog.  

I told a friend of mine about this today.  He said if I had sprayed the pit pull I might get charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.  I replied that I didn't think dogs had those kinds of rights, and that I was not going to allow my dog to die.  

I live in Massachusetts.  If I feel I am in immediate danger of being attacked by a dog, could I get in trouble if I spray the dog with pepper spray?  Thanks in advance for your help!"

232,Apartment Security Guard Selling my Friend's Info to People,"Edit: Google bot asking for location... \[USA\]

2nd edit: What if she can prove that multiple security guards are giving her whereabouts away? Would that be enough to file a lawsuit against the security firm?

Long story short, I have confirmed that the apartment lobby security my friend lives in is reporting to non police whenever she leaves or enters her apartment for financial gain. The solution isn't as easy as telling the building manager about the issue... she doesn't really want to go the legal path. I told her she can move, but she feels like she is letting the haters win by doing that.

She just wants to live without the feeling of being watched and betrayed by the security. I know people will ask ""what evidence""? It's best to not say on here as it took months to gather, and she has proven this to me to be correct.

I know some who read this will feel skeptical and assume she is paranoid. I was skeptical in the beginning as well, but there are a few ways to prove this and in fact, she was correct.

She wants advice on how to best resolve this without taking legal action, however if she were to take legal action, what advice would I give her? Any advice would be greatly appreciated legal or non legal."
233,"My lawyer is suing me, need advice","Does anyone know an experienced lawyer who could give me some advice? (Location Virginia/Washington DC)

Basically, I hired this lawyer to help me settle a dispute with my former business partners who owed me a large amount of money (landlord was also involved). 

It really was a mess, however my lawyer definitely had unconscious bias and didn’t do the minimum in advocating for me. Ultimately it costs me thousands of dollars as the landlord walked away with a $50,000 lump sum from my ex-partners while I walked away with $50,000 divided monthly over 4 years. 

My ex-partners have a lot of money mind you and they could have easily cut me a check while they were busy cutting the landlord a check but my lawyer was negotiating this $50,000 / 4 years settlement when he should have started the negotiations at a lump sum settlement. Gross negligence/incompetence and unconscious bias in my book.  

So now after already having paid my lawyer $8,000 and having ignored his continued requests for monthly payments during covid, he’s now asking for a further $17,000 and has filed a complaint with the circuit court against me. 

I was never once given a statement of services. Just signed an engagement letter (to charge hourly) and gave him a retainer. Not once did he sent me a statement of services until I received the lawsuit I didn’t even know how much I owed him. 

Is this his last ditch attempt to scare me into giving him something? Should I threaten him with a counter-malpractice suit or is that fruitless? I’m not sure what to do I’m financially in a bind as I’m still paying back the original loan for the business that I took out and have to now deal with this lawyer. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Danke."
234,"Vermont: Realty agent/company refusing to provide bank information, now being threatened with a 14 day notice to pay or be evicted.","Vermont. I rented a home at the beginning of July through a realty company. My lease states verbatim ""Rent may be paid by check, cashier's check, bank draft, or money order"".

Despite politely hounding the realty company via email, phone calls, and in person at their office, they failed to get me the bank info by the end of July/first of August. So I paid via money order because I didn't want issues and it wasn't too much skin off my back.

However, now that the end of the month is rolling around they have still failed to provide me with their bank information and yesterday I received a phone call from my realtor basically stating that after conversations among their staff and with the person who's house they are renting to me, they have decided against being paid via bank draft and will only be accepting checks or money orders in the future.

I politely but firmly insisted that I be given bank information since my lease specifically states that draft payments are allowed, and I prefer the convenience of automatic withdrawals.

My realtor refused, saying that their decision is final and if I want to drag it out in court I'll end up losing money regardless. They ended the conversation by saying that if they do not receive my money order or check by the first of the month, they will initiate legal action and I will be given a 14 day notice to pay my rent or I will be evicted.

Additionally, I will be charged 50 dollars per day that the rent is late (this is in the lease). 

Frankly, the tone of the conversation was incredibly unprofessional and I would like to know if they have some sort of leg to stand on that I haven't been able to catch (I Googled extensively!).

Despite their shitty attitude, I would like to continue living here despite their shitty behavior, because relocating will be stressful and expensive and I work an average 60 hour week with one day off. I would also like to avoid court if possible, but I understand that it may be inevitable.

Please let me know if I need to add any details. Thanks!

Edited to add: I forgot to point out that my realtor emailed me a new lease with the part about bank drafts omitted and simply stated ""Sign and return. Your old lease is rendered null and void at this point"". I have not signed it, nor have I responded to the email."
235,"On the topic of ""solicitation""","I came to you today to seek some advice regarding a certain activity i partake in during my off time from work and whenever i have vacation time; but first some context. I (23M) like con going and what not. I'm not a particularly out there person, so when i started to actively partake in these events, as a way to chop it up with people, i pass out snacks for free to any and all con-goer if they so choose to take one. To date, I have done this 3 times,  at 2 cons in Texas and 1 time in my home state of California. 

I was kinda able to slip under the radar in Texas, seeing as the security and management at those events were rather lenient ( I even offered them snacks and they were happy to take some). Upon trying to pull this in California I saw that it was more of a complicated matter; But i did ask permission from the event organizers the morning of the events ( which was something i hadn't previously done) and all thought I wasn't granted permission to be inside of the event even with my admission already bought and paid for in advance. They were kind enough to let me stand near the entrance to pass out the snacks. 

Long story short, i wanted to ask if there was any legal way i could gain permission to partake in these events while doing what I do, without having to get confronted by event management or security that what I'm doing is solicitation. Or is it just a matter of getting in contact with the organizers and seeing if I can have a special permission to do it on the property.

From what I can see, I don't think I do ""solicitation"" due to:

1. I don't actively engage with the passerby, I let them engage with me if they so choose to
2. I don't block there path, I just walk non-stop until someone decides to stop me
3. I offer something, but for nothing in return, I don't ask for them to do anything for me, their is no ""catch""

I'm just planning to go through with this at a bigger event this year, and I don't want to  get into trouble. Any advice helps, Much thanks!"
236,[Michigan] TIL the most stubborn thing you can do in a psych-ward is to refuse treatment and complain that your family stole your money/trust fund.,"I was recently admitted to a psych-ward due to aggression problems and what they claim is bipolar tenancies. The aggression I agree with but the bipolar, I don't see it. Yeah, I have triggers. I just hate when people/family use them against me. 'Cause They know, that I know, so on and so on. And, it drives me crazy. (hehe)

I was awoken mid-November by a court-ordered psych evaluation. I was arrested and all. Then transported to a local evaluation center in handcuffs. I refused treatment. I wouldn't sign a thing or consent to anything. I just wanted to be released. I spent 8 hours just staring at the floor.

Yeah, I trashed my room. I was pissed, I was mad that I had recently sold my car. When I signed the paperwork, the title, it reminded me of when I signed away a trust; MET - Michigan Education Trust. I threw away my life that day. Just signing that legal document brought all those emotions back. What was I thinking? I gave away everything. Giving away the trust made it illegal for me to attend any higher education institutions.

I quit my job a few years ago and I only had enough savings to pay off one of my credit cards. So, I cashed the trust away. It was the dumbest decision of my life. I used a small potion of the money to payoff the credit cards and the remainder, I had a mutual agreement with my mother to use it on a later date. But, asking for money from my parents felt like I was stealing from them. I could've just asked my parents for help but I didn't want their answer of ""Get a Job.""  I threw away my life over a credit score.

I did have the odd jobs of mowing the lawn at my late grandmother's house. I was paid decently for the work. But my parent's sold the house last year and I've yet to be read the will of my late grandmother. My uncle, the executer of the will, just refuses to read it or bequest anything to me. I have nothing.



Anyways, I'm currently having a hearing at probate court in the near future. Its for review of guardianship and power of attorney since I refused to consent to anything when I was in the ward. I just want to know should I be prepared for? 

	* Will there be question to answer? 
	* Can I bring written witnesses of my character? 
	* What do I have to do show that I'm an independent adult even though I'm living with my parents and basically dependent off them for shelter and food."
237,Is it illegal to insufflate vitamin c in powder form in public?,"Probably a stupid question and a stupid thing to do, but I want to know if snorting vitamin c in public is illegal? I have crushed up some tablets in a small bag and have got my credit card and $100 note prepared but am just researching now to make sure I'm not breaking any laws by doing this. does anybody know?

238,"When kicking out a roommate, is it legal to change the locks and move their belongings into a storage unit? - FL","Roommate hasn't been paying her share of the bills for about 5 months now. She said she was going to pay me back with a student loan but of course that never happened. She left this weekend but not before only trying to pay just part of the bills again. I sent her a message saying that because she obviously has no plans on paying any of the past bills she owes nor future ones I am changing the locks and moving her stuff into a storage unit so I can get a new roommate. She wrote me back saying not to touch her stuff and that she will be back for it.

I want this to go as smoothly as possible since I rent an apartment and don't want any drama in my complex. I won't be charging her for the unit, I just don't want her back here. She could also be lying and just trying to get back inside so she can stop me from kicking her out.

Is it illegal to change the locks and move her stuff into a storage unit? I just don't want to do anything criminal in case she gets the cops involved. I have no problem with her suing me as she owes me so much money I doubt she would even try. And in that case, it would probably end badly for her. I don't think she can even be considered a tenant when she hasn't paid what she owes for so long?

Anyways, thanks for any tips and advice!

Edit: She is a co-tenant but she doesn't have a copy of the lease. Whenever we get in an argument and I tell her I won't pay my part either so we'll just get evicted and sued, she always says I'll be the only one getting sued because she's not on the lease. I don't know why she thinks that when her name and signature are very clearly on the lease. Just some more info because I'm brainstorming how she would prove to the cops she lives here if all her stuff is gone and she doesn't have a lease.

2nd edit: So since everyone is so protective over this person that hasn't paid her bills for **5 months** (if you don't know you're going to be evicted for not paying after 5 months you've got to be borderline mental), if she doesn't just take her belongings and leave she will completely lose access to everything else she hasn't paid for like electricity and internet. There are laws stopping a landlord from cutting off utility access to a non-paying tenant but as everyone has so kindly pointed out, I'm not her landlord. If someone is using your electricity without paying for it, isn't that theft?"
239,My 18 y.o. son inherited a large amount of money from his grandparents. How can I legally prevent him from spending all of it?,"Hello everybody!

&#x200B;

I know it isn't a frequent question here, but maybe you could suggest some loopholes for me. I know that you need some details. But unfortunately, I cannot share a lot here. So, I'll try to explain the whole situation here briefly.

&#x200B;

My wife's parents died years ago, leaving our son with a lot of money. Normally, he would be able to access it when he turns 18 y.o. I thought that he would use that money wisely, like pay tuition fees, deposit for his first property, or at least travel for a year or two. Unfortunately, I have to admit that my parents-in-law didn't expect that their favorite grandson would just start wasting their money.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I'm trying to change his mind and explain to him that he can easily waste that money. I even found some info on [https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/](https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/) on what he can invest it to. But, it's not as easy as I'd expected.

&#x200B;

I'm afraid that he will lose everything just in one year. He recently got access to the bank account and spent 25K on some skins for games. I have no clue what the hell this thing even is and why it's so important for the younger generation. But who in their right mind would spend 25K on games? When I was 18, I could only dream of having a grand in my bank account.

&#x200B;

His grandparents' will state that he can get access to the inheritance when he turns 18, and there are no restrictions with regard to how he uses it. Maybe they believed that he would grow up as shy and modest as he used to be when he was a kid, which was the last time they saw him.

&#x200B;

I'm not good at the ins and outs of our legal system, hence why I am hoping to get some advice here. I ca n see how the money burns a hole in his pocket. I'm afraid that by the time he graduates, he will have all these pointless skins for the games and some expensive toys but have no place to live.

&#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for your attention. If you know what I can do in this situation, please let me know."
240,My friend is selling videos of her and her boyfriend having sex and wants to know if NDAs will help her legally stay safe or putting text in the video that it may not be shared. They are both 20 Y.O.,"They have only been sending videos to one guy and then deleting them afterward. 

&#x200B;

She wants to know if there is any way to protect herself from other people seeing the videos. For example, if she edited the video to say ""This video belongs to (Her name) and all Copywrite terms state that only (Name of person she is sending the video to) may view this video. If this video is shared with anyone else besides (whoever buys it) major fees/legal trouble will occur."" Will this make it so the guy cannot send the video to anyone? Also- if she makes him sign an NDA would that help? The boyfriend is consenting BTW"

This member is now show symptoms (coughing, feeling tired).  My mother was aware of this and informed me and nevertheless still travelled (flew) from NY to SC to visit my sister and her two babies as well as my 87 year old grandmother who has emphysema and my father who both live next door. Also the are the babies parents. Btw I know for a fact my. Grandmother and the babies are unvaccinated and I think the rest may not be either! I really don’t know what the right thing to do here is ! I wish my mom would take this more seriously especially considering she is a nurse!! I fear for my nephew niece grandmother and the rest of my family! The other member of my household I definitely think has covid ! I know for a fact he came in contact with someone who is covid positive! I myself am going to get tested and inform my job but the test might not detect it  so early after exposure! Idk what to do! Should I do something!? Like call the police department where my sister lives or the SC dept of health or something! No one in my family would listen to me anyway and it’s too late for that now! What if something happens to the kids or my grandmother! Would she have been allowed to fly if there was something wrong?"
242,"(Cananda, ON) Just moved into our apartment at the start of the month and found out our neighbours are CRAZY.","Hello everyone and Iapologize in advance if this question is frequentley asked but I couldn't find one specifically geared to me. Here goes, going to keep this as short as possible.

We (M/25, F/31, F/2yo) moved into our basment apartment August 1st. I was between jobs and I was very lucky to get this apartment for my family and I as we were down to just enough money to get it. We move in and everything seems fine until about the third day in. We get call from our Landlord about ""Perfumed Cigarettes"". I figure the upstairs tenants (three apartments in a house. Basement, main floor and attic) are talking about pot so we stop smoking on the landing outside then and there. The complaints don't stop.


 Now they are saying their house is filled with both smoke and overpowering perfumes/cologne. So we take down our automatic air freshener and seal all of the vents in order to avoid any smell at all from going up. The complaints don't stop.



Now it's our electronic cigarettes that are bothering them. Apparently so much vapour has seeped its way into their apartment that they've felt the need to get doctors notes to give to the landlord. I'm not stopping. It's not illegal and I'm feeling very intruded upon because my landlord has asked me to smoke it outside because he doesn't know enough about them.



A week ago today I recieved an N5 form for the complaints above. mainly for smoke going into their apartment though. They're claiming it's drugs. Unspecified which drugs but drugs nonetheless. We've shown our landlord everything that we've been doing to tryand avoid any problems with them but he just shrugs and say ""What do you want me to do? They complain so I have to continue with legal action. Unless you quit what your doing within 3 days.""



WE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING. This is insane. I'm afraid. My grandmother has been here with my stepson since monday and the complaints have continued all throughout the week. He seems to think I just smoke pot with my grandmother who basically acts as a judge on both my behaviour and how we're doing as a household. (I'm trying to get custody of my 9yo stepson).



He still doesn't care. My understanding is that their comlaints will eventually lead me to court where I have to defend myself against these groundless claims. Problem is that I have a criminal record and these other tenant don't and they've been here FOREVER.



I'm scared. I don't have enough money to move. I've said again and again to come to my house when the omplaint happens so I can show you nothing is happening but he says he can't. I've told him to send the cops but they dont come yet they fill out a complaint report which looks awful on me.



Do they have to prove their claims or is the constant comlpaints and records of them going to be enough? How can I protect myself? I've spoken with them a total of 2 times. Both times I could plainly see that they were mentally unstable. One of them threatened my wife over a slight misunderstanding so I just have to assume that they can't be reasoned with. They say my e-cigerette is harming them along with pot yet they smoke cigerettes like chimneys. What can I do? Is there an upside to this? Will they lose their tenancy if shown to have made baseless claims? I've heard that during court over a dispute that I am not required to pay rent during that time, That can't be true can it?



Help! Thanks in advance.   

Edit: I will try to speak with them. It's against my judgement but that seems to be the consensus. Any thoughts on what I should try to say? I'm afraid I'll just make things worse. None of you are here so you don't know the exact situation and what these people are like. I know people probably come on here all the time trying to see if there's a way to squeeze out of trouble even if they're in the wrong and try to paint themselves in a better light but the things I've stated here are verbatim. Exactly the way they happened and it's difficult to state it here without sounding exactly what I've mentioned previous. 


 Fuck man I feel like everyone's against me. I just lost my job because some big corporation decided to cancel all their contracts and hire on minimum wage employees. I went from paying a mortgage on my first home to the situation in in now and now... Fuck it. Fuck those loons. I'll see them in court or in front of a board or what the fuck ever. I try to be nice to everyone as a rule and I will be nice to them. They'll fuck up. I know they will. I'll make sure I capatalize on it when they do."
243,We brought our cat in to get neutered at a clinic and were returned a dead cat and a huge bill. Is there anything we can do?,"We are located in California.

We brought our 6 month cat in today to get neutered. He was a healthy cat, and he passed away during the procedure due to complications with anesthesia. 

Now, as I'm writing this we are devastated for loosing a beloved member of our family, but this is crazy. I understand it's a very freak accident and occurs very rarely, but two things I can't help but feel we were misguided about:

1.	We were never informed that this was a risk that happens to about 1/1000 cats. Yes, they give you a liability paper that no one ever reads to protect them from getting sued if you ever have to deal with a misfortune such as ours. Rare, yes, but if you have a 1/1000 chance of your pet dying, you should at least be notified verbally of the chances, don’t you think? 

2.	We don’t know if this was negligence on the staff, lack of attention to detail, misdoes or what. he didn’t have any preexisting conditions that we knew about, but he had a very audible breathing noise if you took two seconds to listen, this should have made him a pretty high contender for someone to at least be a little concerned. We weren’t notified of any of this however.) Regardless, speculation will get us nowhere, but the worst part of it all....

They still stuck us with the bill. 

We understand that a medical procedure takes time, money, and material, but we just aren’t satisfied being handed a dead cat and a ridiculous bill. Is there anything we can do?"
244,Opioid crisis victim,"Hello. I  am hearing all sorts of talk about ""big pharma"" being held responsible for the opioid crisis and the damage done to individuals and their families. Long story short... I was injured while in the US Navy.  I was immediately put on percocet and valium. In less than 90 days, I was being prescribed 30mg Roxicodone 3x daily. When I first ran out, I thought Inhad the flu.  When I went to my squadron doctor, he explained that I had not the flu but needed to keep taking my roxicodone. This was the moment I realized I had an addiction. I asked for time off to get over the withdrawal and was reprimanded and told to take my meds and get back to work.  I couldn't believe I had taken on an addiction without knowing. I  was super healthy ""Joe Navy"" and admittedly naive. 
Soon I was out of the Navy with an honorable discharge due to medical issues with my injury.  In less than a year the addiction I unwittingly picked up while enlisted was off the hook.  I had my general practice doctor giving me 3 different opiates, specialist giving me more. The VA was also giving me an absolutely perverted amount of drugs. Soon I was eating 5-7 100mcg fentanyl patches daily while wearing 3 on my ribs.  When I ran out early, my doctors would tweak the prescription and get me a refill early without question.  When I asked about getting help, I was told my injury required lifelong opiate therapy. It took me 2 years of digging to find a doctor willing to give me suboxone, which saved my life just before I died from opiate toxicity. I began this ride a naive fool and was taken advantage of for profit and denied helpnquitting.  I can't help but feel like others, being law firms, are going to profit off all of it.  How do I get into a class action or go about filing my own lawsuit. This isn't just about big pharma, but the doctors overprescribing. It's also about the VA giving out opiates to hush veterans who are in medical need. These meds destroyed me in every way.  I never shared. I never partied or sold. I never bought street drugs when I ran out. My addiction was a life of shame, embarrassment,  and trying not to get sick. What can I do to make a stand?"
245,[USA] How is RateMyProfessor not slander? Is it possible to get my reviews taken down?,"As a disclaimer, I'm not actually planning to get my reviews taken down.

I'm a professor (tenure-track, so my position is reasonably secure unless I kill someone) at a decent flagship university, and I guess this question is mostly theoretical, unless there are some easy steps I can take, in which case I will take them.

I am a good lecturer; my internal evaluations (administered by the university, usually 60-70% of my students in my 200-student class answer these) I end up scoring somewhere between 4.7-4.9/5.0. I am popular, students like me and open up to me, and I do a good job (students enrolled in other sections often come to my lectures so that my lecture hall is usually overflowing and students have to sit on the floor/stairs).

The problem with being in a job that deals with many people is that there are always someone who is disgruntled. It's generally the students who are doing poorly in classes (being a state school, there are huge variations between students; some students, having been the best in their tiny high school classes in rural areas, realize that they are below average, and they tend to struggle with coming to terms with this fact.)

For whatever reason, I tend to get the brunt of their wrath more than my colleagues (possibly because I'm young, friendly, and female, so students tend to expect me to be nicer. Along the same lines of thought, I also get a ridiculous amounts of requests from recommendation letters, even from C students, compared to my colleagues.)

This means that the few who feel particularly upset will turn to RateMyProfessor and write scathing and sometimes false reviews about me. I know that RateMyProfessor generally tries to moderate comments, but some students write things that are blatantly FALSE. One review says something along the lines of how I was a hardass during the semester, then changed my tactics around the time the internal evaluation rolled around. In reality, I wasn't even aware of the internal evaluation period, and I stayed consistent during the semester.

Another review made up quotes that I supposedly said in class that sounds very rude, but I would never say anything like this. The reviewer claims to have gotten a D in the class, but I actually gave no D's in my class (due to weird institution rule, D is a fail, and I give everyone either A-C or F). Some reviews are sexist or racist, as well.

So most of my reviews on RateMyProfessors are negative, and I am scoring somewhere in the mid-3 range (out of 5), which is almost 20-25% difference from my internal evaluations. 

Of course, no university administration takes RateMyProfessors seriously precisely because of this issue, but I know that my parents have felt very hurt from seeing these reviews, and close friends have told me that they were shocked by these ""quotes"" that they saw on RateMyProfessors.

So somehow these are somewhat damaging to my personal life, which I cannot quantify (they have no impact whatsoever to my professional life, though). I feel that these reviews are borderline slander, and while I could prove some proof that what they say is false, I would have to dig very deep and spend a lot of my time. Also, the onus shouldn't be on me; it should be on the person making these accusations.

So, is there anything I can do? I am mostly just curious about the legality of this website, because they are so targeted against individuals. I imagine they work the same way as reviewing businesses, although they are not so closely tied to the reputation of a single individual (who never really signed up for this!) and places like Yelp or Tripadvisor sometimes gives the businesses opportunities to respond (maybe I can do that too, but doing that will probably actually damage my professional reputation...)"
246,(CA) Can I sue my husbands doctor?,"(CA) My husband has been taking pain medication for years because he has a back injury.  He's been told that it is unadvisable to have it operated on because he will most likely roll out in a wheelchair permanently.  He's been told he will spend the rest of his life on painkillers.  His doctor has been cutting him back on his pain killers over the past two years to the point he is not functional.  He just sits in pain, bitching and moaning all day.  He's become a useless knot on a log.  He can't do anything, he is in a constant shitty mood, we havnt had sex since she cut him back... Unless something changes I'm going to have to leave.  I can't take it anymore, and it's not his fault, it these damn CA doctors!  Do I have some grounds to sue his doctors for alienation of affection and making my life hell?  My husband is too scared to try to fight it because he's scared he'll get cut off completely."
247,What is the Legality of Covering a Car in Saint Patrick's Day Stickers?,"I have an estranged family member that I used to live with for about four years. I eventually moved out due to constant verbal abuse. Recently, my mother gave me a few 50 counts of St Pattys Day stickers complete with leprechauns, four leaf clovers, pots of gold, etc. Now I'm not saying I have enough to cover an entire car, but maybe just one of the doors, obviously not on the glass of anything. She isn't Irish and has (to my knowledge) no strong opinion on the holiday. Would such an unruly crime be protected from being considered harrassment? Thank you for your time."
248,"Crazy roommate (21M) is making my (21F) life hell, can he legally kick me out if my name is on the lease? + a few other qs (NS, Canada)","Got back in touch with an old ex from high school a while ago and we started talking. I was in a really bad living situation at the time and I wanted out and he was still living with his parents so we decided to rent a place (2 bedroom/2 bath) together. I was gonna pay $500 of the rent and he'd cover the rest in exchange for getting the bigger bedroom with the ensuite. He lived far away at the time so I was the one who met the landlord and signed the lease and stuff and he just gave me the money for it, his name isn't on the lease at all. Anyway he came into some money, bought me a new laptop for school, and suddenly he offered to pay all the rent and I agreed, and he even wanted to pay 6 months rent up front (he thought we could get a discount offering this, and we did, actually). He'd interaced the deposit a few weeks earlier and I'd met with the landlord and signed the lease then so that's why my name is on it. It's a 12 month lease if that matters. In late September he gets a bank draft for almost $10k and gives it to the landlord and starts staying in the apartment. Then in October we both move in.

This is where everything starts to go so wrong. I was working and in school at the time but I was struggling with both and the new place was a long drive from work so I quit. But halfway through October I started wondering if the courses I was taking were even useful and after discussing it with my roommate we agreed that I'd be better off working and getting experience and going back to school in the future since I couldn't be a cop any time in the next 5 years anyway since I did illegal substances. So I dropped out and I wasn't working but we paid 6 months rent up front and my roommate was the one who buys groceries and stuff. Unfortunately I have bills, internet, car, insurance, phone, and didn't have any way of paying so I had to ask my roommate to help and he did. It sounds helpful but this did much more harm than good. I struggle with depression and anxiety and the only thing that has ever motivated me to work and leave the house has been when I need money urgently and with him just giving me money it became very hard to start applying for jobs so I spent most of the day just laying in bed and not feeling like doing anything.

In November I started dating one of my roommate's online friends he introduced me to through World of Warcraft. he lived in California. I really wanted to go see him but I had no way of paying for the plane ticket so I asked my roommate for help and he kept refusing, saying it was too expensive, too short notice, etc stupid excuses. My boyfriend was moving back in with his parents soon so I needed the ticket that weekend. I was so desperate and drunk I told my roommate I'd sleep with him and take his virginity if he bought the ticket but he refused. I told him I'd get a job and pay him back and he finally accepted if I paid him back AND slept with him so he bought the ticket and sent me the info. When I sobered up in the morning I realized what I agreed to and I told him I was never going to fuck him and that I was just drunk. He was upset and said I needed to pay back double the cost of the ticket (like $2000 or something) or he was going to cancel it so I agreed to once I had the money. I believe this is soliciting prostitution or extortion and I have text messages from this time, could I bring them to the police?

He didn't cancel the ticket and I went to visit my long distance boyfriend but my roommate started acting really really shitty after this. Just ignoring me, spending all his time in his room, when I brought company over he didn't even say hi. He started drinking which was alarming and around the end of November he got extremely drunk kept messaging me about how much he loved me and shit and I got scared and called the cops. I wanted them to take him to the hospital but they said he wasn't in any danger. When I told them I felt threatened they said they couldn't do anything since he technically lived here too and since we were exes I think they were taking me much less seriously or maybe it was my record, but they did nothing, they just left him here and told me I should move out. I don't have a fucking lock on my bedroom door and I went to sleep that night terrified he was going to break in and do something. In the end nothing happened but I've never felt less safe in my own home. In the morning I ran into him when I getting some water and we got into a fight and I told him how much I hated him and living here and he told me I could leave whenever. Then he went back to his room and started ignoring me again.

Around this time I wanted to visit my boyfriend again so I had to ask my roommate for money again. He just texted me asking how much and when I told him he sent the money then went back to ignoring me. I went for a week this time and he didn't message me at all. When I got back I almost expected to find him having committed suicide, but he was ok. All of December was a good month and I never had to interact with him at all except when he made supper or when we needed to go get groceries. I started applying for jobs and stuff and I was looking into how hard it was to immigrate to the USA on a fiancee visa. I was finally moving forward in life. I asked for money again so I could visit my boyfriend for Christmas and he gave it to me without complaint and I visited for 10 days, but on the last day I was there my boyfriend broke up with me and I was absolutely devastated, I had lost all of my goals and now I had nothing to work for again. I was getting drunk every night.

I decided to go on a trip to get over it and drove to Toronto with my roommate. We stayed for a few days and had a good time mostly but he got really annoyed when I asked for separate hotel rooms. I just didn't feel comfortable staying in the same room with him. He agreed eventually and the rest of the trip was fine. The drive back was very awkward and we had a couple of arguments and I finally got it across to him that I am never going to date him no matter what and the rest of the way he just ignored me. Now when we got back he was even more withdrawn than usual and started talking about how he was going to move out and stop giving me money and that these past few months were such a huge, miserable waste of time. This entire time he hasn't been working or in school and he hasn't been doing anything with his life. I wonder why it was such a huge waste of time lmao. I got pissed about this and told him that and he just went back to ignoring me again.

Now none of the jobs I've applied for have called back, I'm so broke I have no money in any of my accounts, I won't be able to pay any of my bills this month. Rent is paid for until March which is the only good thing about all this, but I need to know if he can kick me out or not? Like I said my name is on the lease, it's a 12 month contract, his name doesn't show up anywhere but verbally of course I agreed to let him stay and he paid all the money. Also if he moves out instead, is it possible for him to be on the hook for the other 6 months of the 12 month contract (since only 6 months have been paid for so far)? He verbally agreed to live here and pay the rent and it will be a breach of terms if he just bails won't it? And is it worth talking to the cops about the prostitution/extortion thing? Everything is such a mess right now and I really need help, thanks for reading"

The money was going to her ""Business"" account on PayPal and she was upset because I didn't do the 'friend' option.

After the 11k lost her PP was closed. She starts to pressure me to send her money through Wester Union (WU). I have lost 9k at WU now.

Everything about this ""relationship"" has been shallow and fake as possibly can be.

The first day we met she plays a joke on taking my debit card. The last day we met she tells me she ""forgot how my American money looks like"". Implying for me to leave some money.

We never had sex, we never even kissed, nothing between us, and I'm not bitter over that. I was honest to her but she was a world of lies to me from the start of 2019 to today.

She lied about buying so many things. I had to buy my way into her Instagram and where she told me she was, her Instagram showed her partying. I documented everything.

&#x200B;

I want to get my money back from her.

Is it possible to sue her under her business through international court?

How can I fight for my money back through WU and win?

I am willing to show all the conversations in the police report.

Prostitution is legal in Czech and even her business (webcamming).

&#x200B;

Usually when I deliver her money she gives me a week of distance.

It has caused me financial and emotional stress beyond what I can ever imagine.

I have never had a girl before and I was attractive to her. I never expected to get played like this.

I see her ""liking"" a guy's Instagram post every day. I know she's interested in him and her best friend even added the guy today.

&#x200B;

I am losing my mind and don't want my money, my future I believe I could have with this women to go to a scam and a player.

&#x200B;

I am well aware of all the negatives comments I will be getting but this story is true and really did happen.

252,Stepdad broke my sons nose in a fight,"Tonight I was reviewing my sons grades and he had some crappy ones and my husband said “let’s see how your father would deal with you if you were there living w him.” 

My son got really angry and pushed him and they started physically fighting. I ran and separated them for context my son is stronger than him he is 16 almost 190 and wrestling in high school. 

After that my son went outside and called grandpa to pick him up. I went to take care of the two siblings who were crying and then I heard my husband went outside and by my sons account he started beating on him and things escalated he kicked my son in the face and broke his nose. 

My father took him to the hospital where he got an X-ray and it was really broken. The police came and told me that Florida is prosecuting both my son to juvenile because he started and my husband with a felony. 

I am so horrified and shocked and sad. I don’t even know how to begin processing. My husband is not a violent person and my son is also a really good kid but he’s a teen and sometimes has a temper. Things just escalated quickly. 

To begin...
How will the proceedings go for my son? What should I tell the judge? What are the long term consequences for him? 

How do I start to deal w my husband? Will he get bail? Should we get a lawyer? He has never been arrested before. 

I just got home and I am trying to avoid thinking that Christmas is ruined for all of us. Including two baby siblings. Even though it feels like it. "
253,First time DUI,"First offense and I am being offered diversion. Money is not an option. I want to get a lawyer and get out of this. 

I blew at the scene (blew .17) and did the field sobriety test. Blew again at the station (blew .14). I was extremely cooperative. Reason cops showed up is I was two houses down from my place. And went over a curb. Had to call a tow truck because car was stuck in grass. Cops showed up and investigated my drunkenness. 


Would hiring a lawyer make this any better? I’d rather pay a lawyer than the state. Diversion is expensive and I really don’t care if I have a DUI on my record. I’m going to refuse diversion and just take the charge if it comes down to it. "
254,My brother was the victim of the robbery. Now one if the robbers was found innocent and is suing my brother to get back the money he won from her in a lawsuit.,"For LocationBot: this is in California

The background: My brother was the victim of a beating and robbery. The people were caught and brought to justice (I thought). They all got long jail sentences and my brother won lawsuits against all of them.

Now one of the robbers has been found innocent and exonerated by the court because it was a mistake. From the lawsuit she has paid my brother some money. But now she is suing him for the $40,000 he got from her. Like I said the court exonerated her and the state gave her money for her wrongful imprisonment. I feel bad that she went to jail when she was innocent but my brother was also an innocent victim. I don't get why she is allowed to do this and is suing my brother instead of the state.

My question is: How does my brother get this dismissed, if she is even allowed to do this?"
255,Is this a scam ?,"So recently my sister tried to buy a gun from someone online through telegram, and the day after she got a email from the supposed agency dealing with the package saying the dea confiscated the package and the she had to pay a fine to the dea within 72 hours or she would be arrested, after having to pull out 2 loans she paid her part of the fine. Well, after paying them she got another email from the agency saying if they dont pay $8000 within 72 hours then the dea will confiscate the package and arrest both the buyer and sender of the package for illegal purchase and sells of a firearm. We just want to make sure this is real before we stop paying and my sister goes to jail, before we have to pull out anymore loans."
256,Judge threw out prenup and is requiring me to pay alimony [Texas],"I am very angry with my lawyer and the judge right now and I want to know how to fix this.

My ex wife and I signed a prenup when we got married. It stipulated that if we divorced, my ex would forfeit the right to alimony, child support, and 30% of the marital property (leaving her with 20% for a 50-50 split, still plenty to live on). This is because I entered the marriage with considerably more money and made a considerably higher salary (I am in a white collar position, she is a teacher). 

I thought dividing assets for the divorce would be fairly cut and dry due to the prenup, but she got a lawyer, so I got one too. Her lawyer argued that the prenup, which we BOTH signed, was unfair and illegal. The judge threw it out after my lawyer barely argued for it. He completely dropped the ball and basically just rolled over and took it. 

The judge awarded her 50% of everything except the assets I had prior to divorce, PLUS child support, PLUS alimony. It's like the prenup, a document we BOTH signed and agreed to, was completely ignored. I don't even understand what the point was since the prenup was supposed to protect me and the money I have worked hard to earn. 

I would like to know what legal recourse I have against my lawyer and the judge, since they completely disregarded the contract that my ex and I agreed on prior to marriage. I would not have gotten married had I known that such document that were intended to protect me just meant nothing. Can I sue my ex for the extra property based on what the prenup said? Can I go after my lawyer or the judge or at least report them somewhere?"
257,LandLord fully executes lease with $0.00 mo payment then attempts eviction,"My Landlord had me and my GF resign a lease on 7/3/18. The woman in the office showed us each page and asked us to sign . We signed and management also signed the lease. Two days later the manager sent me a copy of our signed lease stating it was the new lease going forward. At the time I didn’t pay any attention to the rent amount on the lease so I filed it away. My girlfriend did see the rent amount on the lease showed $0.00 lease payment due from 11/17/17 through 3/19/19. I am running late on my September lease payment and my land lord has filed a dispossession claim with the magistrate court seeking eviction due to unpaid rent. I pulled out my lease and realized the document states $0.00 due for the entire lease period and my GF commented that she didn’t know I had paid rent for July and August because our lease stated $0.00 due for the entire lease period. My question is: Can I enter the current binding lease signed on 7/3 into evidence at my dispossession hearing and counter sue for refund of all rent I’ve paid since 11/17/17 through August 2018 and not be charged rent from Sept 2018 through March 19. 2019 . The date the lease ends. The landlord has been very quick to. Push me out of my home of nearly 4 years when they have given other tenants in the complex well over 30 days to pay without eviction filings.

You: I want to know if I can enforce the lease stating $0.00 due from 7/17/17 through 3/19/19 to get the land lord to refund all lease payment made up to sept of this year and also stay in the lease through its expiration on 3/19/19 with $0.00 rent per month."
258,Sexually assaulted my girlfriend while under the influence of LSD.,"I was going to keep this brief but there is way too much to explain. I currently live in Vancouver, BC and attend the University of British Columbia. I am 19 years old with no criminal record or any history of violence in the slightest. In fact, I have always avoided confrontation and considered myself a pacifist. I was even planning on going to an anti-rape rally the following day of this incident. Anyway enough of making myself out as this good person, what I did is absolutely disgusting and unforgivable and I no longer consider myself a good person in the slightest.

On Thursday I stupidly decided to take 5 tabs of LSD, naively thinking that I could handle it and would have a fantastic time. I spent the trip lying on the couch while listening to music in my apartment with a good friend of mine trip sitting me. A few hours in I starting sweating and shaking a lot thinking I had gone insane. I began to scream and shout very scary things to my friend (who I had completely lost all recognition of) these things included suicidal thoughts but to my knowledge were not in any way violent towards anyone other than myself. I actually had no idea that I was saying these things out loud, during the trip it felt like I was travelling to parallel universes where horrible things were happening to me and my girlfriend but I had no idea until the following day that I had said anything aloud. This terrified my friend and was completely unexpected and out of character from me so he called my girlfriend who quickly came over. I continued to have these scary parallel universe situations happen in my mind and sometimes did not even recognise my girlfriend of 4 months. This was terrifying for everyone and I unfairly put a lot of stress and responsibility on them. The parallel universe situation started to improve until I became very happy and content with the current situation which happened to be real life (it seemed too good to be real life). I was now functioning normally but was very much still tripping, we went out for dinner and had a great time together. We were all happy and peaceful and I was completely unaware that anything had actually happened. My friend left and I was alone with my girlfriend. This is where it became very bad.

I have been with my girlfriend for 4 months and have always been very careful and conscious of consent and her well being. I love her very much and have never wanted to do anything that could cause the slightest harm to her. This all changed in one night. We were cuddling on the couch and I began to touch her in a non aggressive but sexual way. She asked me to stop but I continued anyway. This went on for a while, her telling me to stop but me laughing and ignoring her. It was as if I was unaware of what was happening. It began to get much much more aggressive, I was pinning her down and holding her arms back while forcing kisses upon her against her will. She was crying and I was laughing. I eventually took my penis out and began masturbating in front of her, I shouted at her to touch it and I continued shouting at her when she refused to. She then kneed me in the balls and hit me in the face as I was touching her all over and making her touch my penis. After she hit me I lost my temper and began to hit her back, I punched her in the arm and leg and she began to cry again. I continually kicked her in the leg and possibly in the back (my memory of this is quite blurred). So she ran out of the apartment and called her friends for help. But she was scared that I was still suicidal as I had earlier said I would jump out the window or stab myself in the neck in complete seriousness. She didn't want to leave me alone but she was also afraid of me. So when my/her friends arrived they called the police (for my own safety). The police then questioned her and discovered that I had assaulted her so they came to my apartment and arrested me. I spent the night in jail while still tripping on a ridiculously large amount of LSD and was very confused as to what had actually happened.

I went to court the next day and was released on bail under the conditions that I avoid direct and indirect contact with my girlfriend and my friend. I have to go back to court on Friday. I love my girlfriend more than I could ever imagine loving anyone before, the past 4 months have genuinely been the happiest months of my entire life and I care about her deeply. What I did is so horrid and completely unforgivable and I am terrified of myself and I am scared that I don't know who I am or what I am capable of. Nothing like this has ever happened it is more out of character for me than you could ever imagine and everyone that knows me knows this. It is like I became everything that I am against. My girlfriend says it was like I wasn't there, like it was someone else as if she couldn't recognise me. She says she loves me but hates what I did and somehow says she forgives me because she knows that is not who I am. She is scared that I will get a criminal record and be labelled something that I am so against and is just not me. I am also terrified of a criminal record as I feel it will ruin my entire life, neither of us want this and she wants the charges to be dropped completely. I can't afford a lawyer so I will seek legal aid (not sure how it works). The whole situation is a mess because we love each other but can't look at each other in the same way and we don't know how to get passed this.

I am terrified of myself and please understand that I am not trying to excuse myself I know what I did is disgusting and I hate myself for it and accept the consequences. But I am so scared that the past 19 years of my life are all a lie and that I am a monster. But at the same time it doesn't feel real, I only really remember it having been told what happened and so I cant remember all the details. I can see it happening in my head but it doesn't feel real it feels like I am watching it from someone else. I have been having suicidal thoughts and I don't know how to stop them. I don't know how to live with myself knowing I am a monster and the one person that I have hurt is the one person that I love the most.

I'm sorry I gave so many details that are probably unnecessary in this subreddit. My main question for you guys is whether I am able to avoid a criminal record or not.  



TL;DR  Took more LSD than could handle, sexually assaulted and regularly assaulted girlfriend, she called police for my safety (was being suicidal). She doesn't want me to get a criminal record and I want to know if this is possible."
259,Three Letter Agency Keeps Talking About My AGAB,"So I am trans and work for the federal government. I live in Massachusetts, and I have an EEO mediation meeting next month.

260,Family/Teen Issues,"Hi all, 

First, I am posting here for potential legal suggestions, I am not looking to have a debate with anyone over gender identity philosophy or politics. I will not respond to comments debating such. Only just looking for legal suggestions. 

I have a relative, not on Reddit, posting with his permission, living in NY and working through gender identity issues with his teen (14). She's been in therapy for a while and it's gotten to the point where she's been admitted to an outpatient facility. 

The facility is adamant that she needs to be speaking to a transgender counselor/therapist and appears to be strongly pushing that line of reasoning onto her parents. Her parents want her to get help without the agenda, but it seems at every path, there it is. 

It's gotten to the point where the language they are starting to use at the facility is skirting the issue of ""medical negligence"" and potentially her being removed from them if they do not comply with allowing them to continue therapy with the people that they feel are appropriate for her. Additionally, they feel their daughter could potentially act in a way to GET HERSELF removed from them by lying or manipulating situations to that effect. 

They also have a toddler and are concerned that should something like the above happen, and she is removed from them under ""medical negligence"" conditions, there would be ramifications for their son as well. So, my questions are: 

1) Is that even a thing? If they remove her, can that translate to him as well? 

2) Is there anything that they can do proactively, from a legal standpoint, to protect themselves should the facility decide to press on removing her?"
261,Suing OBGYN for gender/age discrimination for not performing sterilization procedure US?,"BEFORE DOWNVOTING

> When refusing a customer is illegal

>There are many anti-discrimination laws at the federal, state, and local level. Chief among these is the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in public accommodations.

>Under Title VII of that federal law, **no business is allowed to turn away a customer based on their status as a member of one of these protected classes**. Based on recent court rulings, sexual orientation and gender identity are now also federally protected classes.


Hello.
Looking for advice in possible grounds for this? OBGYN has denied me and many other women this medical procedures on basis of age, lifestyle and I believe gender as it is significantly easier to get a vasectomy.

Thoughts?

What about when a person ends up pregnant?

262,"Involved in a hit and skip, ticket issued has messed up information.","After being forced to stay home for a few months to take care of my ill wife i got really down on money. This lead to a lapse on my car insurance. I live in Ohio in the middle of the snow belt and I was driving to a side job i was going to do for the day. The windshield was iced over after going a block down the road and i decided to turn into a parking lot to let the car warm up more. I couldn't see a truck in the oncoming lane and we collided (his fender into my front bumper). I'm young and panicked and took off because i didn't know how the situation would be handled with my lack of insurance at the time.

Fast forward a month or so later and the police showed up to my door. Asked a few questions and i confessed to a hit and skip. Now they needed to ID the car so they could write up the ticket. It wasn't at my property at the time. The officer asked if it was in my wife's name which it is. He asked if it was a Blue Kia and confirmed that. So he goes back to the station and searches the car and brings me a ticket. I look at the ticket and the vehicle they have listed on the ticket and it's a different blue Kia we own. We gifted this other car to her mom months ago and It's never had any damage and has valid insurance. I haven't driven it for a half a year and it's certainly not the car that was involved in said incident. Is there any way i can get these tickets thrown out possibly? I will list offenses and their respective identifications below.

I know I can't legally waive any liability around my premise but I'm wondering if I can include an indemnity clause in a contract the parent's sign asking them to compensate me for any legal fees related to me taking care of their child meaning that even if I lose a court-case they have to pay my legal fees making suing me a losing proposition.

267,Christmas parade makes me a prisoner in my neighborhood [GA],"We live in a mid-size town in south Georgia. We moved here from another southern state but apparently it’s a “southern thing” to have the Christmas parade the Saturday before Thanksgiving because that’s what Jesus and Robert E. Lee would have wanted.

We don’t have a traditional downtown area, so our town mayor/fief lord has decided in his infinite wisdom that the four lane state highway and a major feeder road should be shut down in both directions for three hours to host the parade. As you can imagine this works out super well and no one is ever inconvenienced…except for last year when some guy was late for work and just drove through the parade at high speed. Luckily, again, we’re in the south so our comically large police department rammed him with a surplus MRAP or something and there were no injuries. 

Getting to my point, my neighborhood has two entrances and both will be blocked for three hours Saturday, 9-12. I assume emergency vehicles can break the blockade and access our neighborhood if necessary so the city thinks that’s all that matters. But is there any legal argument to make here? What if I had to be at work at 12? I’m sure the city would just tell me to leave at 8:30. 

Now if I want to be even more petty, what if I worked across the river in South Carolina? What if Amazon or USPS has to skip my house for the day because of the parade? Is that not technical interfering with interstate commerce? Can I petition Clarence Thomas to come on home and put a stop to this nonsense with some sort of injunction?"
268,[CA] Expelled for failing exam retake - but the professor and school contract made it seem like the retake wouldn't happen till later. Now have $100k in debt and nontransferable credits.,"tl;dr - Was enrolled in for-profit healthcare school, $100k in debt after 4 semesters. I basically feel like I was tricked into showing up to a makeup exam unprepared, then expelled in retaliation for using my disability accommodations to trade class times - the exam wasn't held in accordance with the guidelines I signed nor the syllabus, and the response to me asking whether I should prepare for a retake was essentially ""Don't bring the stuff you've needed for every exam in every other class over the last year"". Couldn't review my exam until the retake, and was told I'd be expelled if I didn't do it right then and there (ie no rescheduling). Also in my attendance contract is an arbitration clause. I'm reaching out to personal injury (breach of contract) and disability lawyers but figured I'd throw something to Reddit for suggestions.

less tl;dr:

> Start a 4th semester class with a long-standing professor we've never met before. This professor has a few arbitrary policies that don't match what we're used to from other professors - including no trading classes with other students (eg morning vs afternoon in the beginning of the semester) to accommodate schedule conflicts. 

> I ask for the class switch anyway and was denied. I plan to deal with it since medication timing would be harder but not impossible (psych drugs that I started because of the program - something like 15% of my class had started some kind of mental health treatment. Even one professor said that was the case when he was in school. Tangentally: my blood pressure went from 120/75 to stage 2 hypertension that needed beta blockers during the course of the program - and went back to normal unmedicated two months after I was expelled.). I use my disability accommodations to essentially overrule the professor's policy after another student approaches me saying they will lose their job if they can't trade with someone (me). This was the first time I invoked disability accommodations while attending.

> Professor allows me to transfer but not the other student. Fine - but this results in me being in a group of 3 for lab - difficult because groups of 2 were the norm in labs (learn a procedure, then break off into doctor-patient pairs to practice. A group of 3 means someone has to sit out and has less hands-on time to practice). 

> Student handbook says failing an exam requires remediation, a letter from the program (which I never got), meeting with professor, and scheduling a retake. Failing the retake = expulsion. Safety violations will be notified immediately after exam ends (these historically were things drilled into our head as ""you will fail if you do this"" - like not maintaining physical contact with a unsteady patient, or not disinfecting before/after patient contact). 

>I take the class final and have pretty bad technique on one part - but neither I nor my partner thought it was bad enough to fail. 

>Days later I got an email saying my performance considered a safety violation and that we should meet - I ask if I should prepare to retake the exam and the reply email was, in its entirety: ""Don't worry, don't bring [individualized tools required for every exam]"". Because other final exams were happening, exams weren't announced to be available for review, and other students who failed met before to discuss why they failed + schedule a retake at that meeting, I put it out of my mind since I don't want to antagonize the professor asking for a more direct answer.

> Day of the meeting: I show up and was told tools would be provided and this was my retake. I was told what I failed at and why (conceptually I knew since I had done it before and was told by the professor I did it right when we first learned) Cue panic - did I miss something in the e-mails? Is this really going to be my retake that determines if I fail out of my doctorate? I hadn't taken medication, wasn't allowed to reschedule even a day later, and make a shoddy attempt at the retake before being told I could leave. I e-mail the professor saying I know it was a bad attempt and that I'd like to meet to verify I can do it before I perform it on actual patients - doing just well enough to pass vs being able to do it well on actual people matters to me. 

>A few weeks later during semester break I'm told I failed. Which sucks on several fronts, but also because now I don't have student loan money coming to cover rent.

>Appeal to the program director, denied. Told to appeal for reinstatement in 5 months, and to wait for suggestions on how to improve.

>4 months go by: Program faculty have yet to reply to several emails asking for updates, so I request and get an appeal extension. 

>10 months go by: I get an e-mail with drafted suggestions on how to build a reinstatement appeal (but not final ones).  Generic things like ""demonstrate ability to follow directions"". A bit late to do much since the appeal's due in 2 months, but I write my appeal around those suggestions with the job I had for the past year along with other stuff (9 pages of reflection and 20 pages worth of doctor's notes, therapist letter of rec, personal letters of rec, etc).

>2 months go by: I submit the appeal, denied via form letter.

Due to the nature of the program - the credits earned don't transfer to other similar programs, can't practice without a licence, so my time spent at the program is essentially a $100,000 hobby/talking point.

Other than having to postpone a first-semester exam and doing just barely passing on it first try and retaking an online quiz due to a low grade, I haven't had other difficulties academically. My overall score in the class I failed was an A-, but because ""safety violation"", the A- became a 0. 

Things seem weird with the program on the whole - like most of the class failing one final exam because a professor left mid-semester. Since I started, two program heads and a half dozen professors (there's about a dozen professors total) have left for ""family reasons"" - including the professor who failed me. 

What do?"
269,White males a protected class?,"Location: Colorado

GM of my company just blatantly exclaimed in front of me (white, male) to another coworker that ""white males are NOT a protected class.""

I don't get offended by much, but to have this happen in the workplace, in front of me with her smug tone, as if I'm supposed to just shrug and continue about my day, really pissed me off.

Was this just rude, or is this actually some kind of beach of law? Given the statement itself is both blatant racism and sexism, I can't imagine how this is OK to claim as being acceptable in the workplace. Whether or not this is legal, I'm not sure.

It was in reference to a white male that they'd previously fired and who is now suing."
270,Dead body Near Apartment,"Location: Jersey City, NJ

A few hours ago my dad encountered a dead body and we don't know how to approach this gently. I will be honest, my dad and I don't exactly trust the police so we want to do everything possible to be within the law. 

I have cameras situated in the building and around the outside so what I thought of doing is getting an external hard drive and putting all the footage from after Wednesday into it and when the police arrive we have a way where they can find the criminal.

So is this the right approach and can you type out what I am supposed to do in steps so that way this can go as cleanly as possible. As you can see, I am panicking and so is my father so it would be very appreciated.

Also, if it helps my mom and dad are the legal owners of the apartment complex."

Can I fight this ticket myself and save the cost of a lawyer? Or should I get a lawyer and show him my evidence? 

Biggest reason I may be able to beat it myself: upon looking at the schools website and looking at their school zone times, it claims it starts at 2:30PM and ends at 4PM. 

On my ticket, the time it was issued says 2:29PM not counting the fact that the officer had to look up my credentials because I didn’t have my ID or insurance. (Very stupid, I know, but I live like a 4 min drive to work and was in a hurry)

273,Gym Class Banned My Wife and I,"My wife and I did a 2 week trial at a well known workout class franchise that we really enjoyed.

She asked if she had signed some sort of consent form and he told her “I'll fucking delete it so you wouldn’t make a big deal about it.”

Naturally, she felt disrespected. I talked to him after class asking him to apologize to her for his attitude. He reacted by telling me that I was giving him attitude. My response was ""I'm asking you to apologize for filming my wife without consent, then being an asshole about it"". He didn't like my calling him an asshole and terminated both of our memberships.

The terms of agreement specifically state that consent must be obtained for photos and videos. In addition, nowhere in the terms of agreement does it state that the instructor has the right to terminate our memberships in this way.

We've contacted HQ and they were not helpful stating that ""the studio is not comfortable having you in the class"". Is there any recourse here to rejoin the class? Sure the guy is an asshole, but the workout is good and the location is incredibly convenient."
274,Here's an odd one...,"Oklahoma, USA.

My neighbor has been working this job site as salvage, his business.  While ripping up a bed that was bolted to a floor, he came across several sheets of plastic with money in it.  Almost 2 million dollars worth of 20s from the mid 80s, perfectly preserved in the sheeting.  Best we can figure the prior owner (deceased) hid this away.  By salvage laws he keeps what he finds while completing a salvage, as far as we know.  No one else knows this money exists.

How does he actually put this money in the bank?  Does he have to fill out a report?  I can't imagine walking into a bank with a couple million in cash is gonna make the teller happy.

What is his legal obligation when finding this much cash, in regards to taxes, registration, etc?"
275,Partner refuses to share STD results,"I am in a new relationship with a guy. We have not had sex. We have been together naked, pre-cum has gotten on my hip area and he has pressed against that area naked. 
I foolishly did that knowing he didn’t have his results yet and honestly didn’t think it would be a problem until further research. 
He ended up getting his test done and after receiving his results, has told me “we have something very serious to talk about.” He won’t share anything regarding the test with me. 

How high is my risk? What can I do about him withholding this information? Is my only course of action to get myself tested?

277,Can my parents make me go to fat camp? [Last Update],"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8r5xo8/can_my_parents_make_me_go_to_fat_camp_update/

Still in New York.

I was taken to camp earlier this month and i did not resist going but i was very very upfront with my parents that i wasnt going to participate whenever possible, they did not take me seriously. I went on the plane and told the conseulers the same once I got on the bus. I was very polite but honest about it. my tactic was to use peaceful ""nonviolent resistance"" until they let me go home unless it turned out to be a crazy camp which it wasnt. I read a book about the civil rights movement a few monts ago and i based what i did off that. Obviously me being at a camp isn't even close to human rights things but the technices still work.

I got to my cabin and I just stayed on bed and politely told them that I didnt plan on doing the exercises. the counselors spoke to me nicely than less nicely and tried to convince me to move but they couldn't and I'm too big to drag off a bed even if they wanted to. They were nice people and i wanted to be nice to them as well but i again was open and honest through everything. i just did not go to stuff after i went into my cabin. i politely calmly refused to go to the opening ceremony, exercises, meetings, activities even though nothing was optional. when the kids in my cabin spoke or tried to convince me to come down I also politely refused to speak to them. They then said that I wouldn't get dinner/lunch if I didnt come down and participate and I refused asuming that they need to feed me sometimes.  

I was right. they didn't give me dinner that night or breakfast because i didn't go to eat but someone brought me a lunch the next day even if it was a terrible overly healthy type of thing. i was still very hungry and very bord but i just kept imagining getting out early. that lasted for six days with me spending all of my time on the bed with them bringing me food. I brought books but they took them away so I just sat and entertained myself by imagining stuff. it was the most boring thing i've ever done. After a week or six days (not sure) the headmaster owner/leader of the camp came and spoke to me directly. Again he was very nice to me and I tried to be nice back but I was open about that i wasnt doing anything until I went home. he was trying to convince me that I wanted to lose weight, but I didnt.

The next day he called my parents and I left for the first time to speak to them in his office. They begged me to do it and we had a weird conference call meeting with them on the phone and the headmaster were they were all trying to convince me to participate and even shaming me a bit, but again I calmly refused very simply. They said they were going to wait three more days to give me ""time to think about it"", and I told them it wouldn't make a difference but they did it anyway so i sat another three and then an extra day waiting. After that we had one more conference and then I was sent that night on a plane ticket home because i peacefully refused to do everything and they saw no point keeping me there. They really tried shaming me near the end but I just told them that i couldn't feel ashamed for not doing something that they wanted me to. I felt slightly sad about having to be a pain for the conseulers or the head guy because neither did anything wrong to me but I was very very very happy that I won't have to spend me whole summer their. My parents are in a sad mood since I came back and they arent really speaking to me but at least i'm home and I won't have to spend another month there. They also got some of the money back because i wasn't there the whole time.

I appreciate all the advice i got even if i don't agree with all of it. thank you. I got most of my summer back."

I thought there was a separation of church and state in the USA, implying churches aren't allowed to take a political stance or put up signs encouraging people to vote one way or another.

I feel really bad about this since it was definitely not on purpose so i try everything to get her to understand that. I have a gf that i love, and a job that i like, why would i send that shit on purpose? And why would i send a reflection?
I lost my job.

Couple days ago i heard that this picture is something that she has saved on her phone and that she goes around saying that ive sent her multiple pictures with my penis visible/half visible, and all my co-workers have seen this alleged picture and heard these things from her. People who were once friends have stopped talking to me and i feel like my life is so ruined that i dont wanna live in the same city and maybe even in the same country anymore. Because im so ashamed, people have told me ”relax as long as you know its not on purpose then its not a problem” but it is for me. Like i dont wanna live with the rumors going around that im some type of pervert who sends nudes to co-workers.

What should i do?

Edit: i probably suck at explaining but it was a reflection on a chromed surface on a bathtub, on snapchat. NOT on purpose. 
Also i feel like i have to explain that im also mad at myself for not checking what i send, but accidents happen.

Edit: people are stuck on the fact that its my fault. I know, i shouldnt have coworkers on my snapchat and i shouldnt take pictures with my clothes off even when im not taking pics of myself.

But what if this would be a pic to my GF, accidentally sent to the wrong person? That is also something that can happen, do i still deserve the same punishment if that would be the case?"
284,My Sister's Surgery Fucked Up Her Life.,"Hey guys, I posted this story elsewhere to seek advice from those who'd undergone the Gastric Sleeve and wanted to get their opinions. But due to a recent discussion with my mum, she's considering take legal action.

I didn't have it done. My sister did.

A few days afterwards, she had two seizures both around 6am. The first was because her sugar dropped and she was dehydrated. The second time, we’re unsure. She's never had seizures before. She's never had a problem with low blood sugar. She has been in and out of the hospital and they've been running tests. She doesn't have a history diabetes or epilepsy.

She is super depressed. She doesn't move from the couch. She can't drive for 6 months because of the seizures. She's constantly running to the bathroom and her sugar keeps rising and falling. It's like living with a ghost.

Her doctor doesn't care. He thinks everything is fine. He didn't showcase concern about her being hospitalized 5 times. He didn't tell her all of the possible side effects... even rare ones like hypoglycemia .

My mum is thinking about getting a lawyer due to the doctor's negligence. Is it even worth it? Would it help? Is this something we should try?

287,[PE] My wife wants me to get rid of my dog. What are my legal options?,"Throwaway.

I'm going to keep this short. I have a pitt rescue, I had him even before I met my wife. I adopted him when he was 15 months old. He had an owner that neglected him and he was very aggresive and ill when I got him, but we managed together and now he's fine. He's a bit wild and sometimes freaks out, but he never gets out of my control. He's the sweetest boy ever. My wife doesn't like him very much, but he's never been aggressive to her except a few incidents in the beginning. She's always been hinting that if we ever have children, we have to get rid of him, but I didn't think she was being serious.

Well, two weeks ago, she broke the news to me that she was pregnant. First i was thrilled even though it caught me by surprise, but then she dropped the bomb on me. She told me that she's not going to raise a kid in a household with my dog and that i have to get rid of him. I definitelly won't do that. I love my dog and I don't think he would do anything to our kid.

What are my legal options here? Can she somehow force me to get rid of him? Can she have him taken by animal control without my consent? i don't want to lose my wife in the process, but I also don't want to lose my dog. If we put him away, it's death sentence for him. No one will adopt a pitt rescue at this age.

edit: location is obviously PA. Sorry, just a typo.

edit:  Thanks everyone for their advice. Glad to hear my wife can't legally do  anything. I'll just tell her my dog is not going anywhere and that if  she loves she must accept both of us. "
288,(CO) My autistic brother was banned from the local hobby shop. Is this legal?,"So my brother suffers from high functioning autism so he has a hard time socializing. One place he loves to go to is a local hobby shop. Me and my brother are regulars there and have spent thousands of dollars over the years. This last week however my brother was banned from the shop. A girl who also goes there claims my brother tried to kiss her and when she refused he groped her.  I tried to talk with the owner and he knows my brother is autistic but he refuses to unban him. He said that he cant allow him in because he's a threat to his female customers. I think this is crap, I talked to my brother about this and he understands he did a wrong thing but he cant understand why he was banned so he's been very depressed this past week and wants to go back to the store.

Is there anything I can do? Is this discrimination because he banned my brother due to his autisim? My parents are planning on getting a lawyer and suing the owner, will this fix the issue?

289,Downstairs neighbor might be a white supremacist,"My husband and I live in an apartment complex, and our building has eight units. It's recently come to our attention that our neighbor in the unit directly below ours is probably a white supremacist. I went downstairs the morning after the debate and there was a homemade sign on his patio window saying ""stand by"". At some point in the past 36 hours, he's also added a print out of the Confederate battle flag.

Now, what I suspect might make this a ""you just have to wait and see"" scenario is that we haven't had any real contact with him since we moved in a few months ago, but we haven't had any real issues either. But these two papers are extremely worrisome because my husband is black, and I am white. I've contacted the property manager and the landlord. Both say there's nothing breaking the lease agreement since they aren't actual flags and they're inside the apartment (rules prohibit flags attached to the outside of the building). We would like to avoid moving because the apartment is otherwise perfect and we don't have thousands of dollars laying around to pay to break the lease and then pay deposit and rent at another place.

We're in California.

Edit: Thanks. You've all been so incredibly kind and helpful by downvoting me answering questions and clarifying information. And by being super condescending because I'm worried about my family's safety. You're the greatest."
290,What happens if my GF decides to get pregnant without my consent?,"Xpost from r/relationships as this seems like a more appropriate sub. 

Hi reddit. I have a question that is, for now, thankfully, hypothetical. I’m not a lawyer nor do I have knowledge of what the law specifies but I’m looking for relationship advice, as well.

So here’s the thing. Recently, my best friend was told by his gf that she’s pregnant. He definitely didn’t want a kid and he trusted her when she said she’s on birth control. Now this made me wonder and realize that it can happen to me or to anyone else. What then?

I am currently in a serious relationship with this girl and have been for 8 months. She’s wonderful, we live together, I can see a future with her but I absolutely hate the idea of having kids or even an unwanted pregnancy that would end in abortion. My GF is taking birth control pills. Just to be clear, we started out using condoms and continued using them until we both got tested and she was already on bc for 3 months. Now after I heard about my friend, I’m super paranoid. What if one day she decides to just not take the pills and get pregnant? Would I be responsible for a child I totally don’t want and certainly did not consent to? I’m seriously considering starting to use condoms again but my GF would surely ask questions. I was also considering a vasectomy since I never ever want kids (vasectomies are perfectly doable in my state at this age, I checked). We also discussed the whole “having kids” topic, I made myself very clear and she said, “well, I think I want kids at some point”. That freaked my out for a bit but I forgot about it until what happened to my best friend.

Reddit, what would happen in the scenario I described? Can I be forced to pay for a kid I didn’t consent to conceive? Long term, vasectomy is the way to go for me regardless but until that happens, I would like to know what are the possibilities.

EDIT: I live in the US. Thanks everyone for the unanimous response. Wow, I must say, I’m no lawyer but this still sounds wrong to me even if it’s the law. If someone maliciously baby traps the other person, their life is essentially ruined for the next 18 years. Insane.

TL;DR: I’m paranoid about my GF trying to get pregnant without telling me"
291,Marijuana Illegal!?!?!?! In California,"Hey, so i just got a new next door neighbor. They seem to be nice, reasonable young couple. I have lived in this house for 20 years, and my grandmother (who is the landlord) does not mind at all.

292,"I Was Sexually Assaulted By A Medical Professional Ten Years Ago As A Minor, Is It Too Late To Do Anything About It?","Ten years ago I was 12 years old. I am now a 22 year old trans man but at this time I identified and presented as obviously female. This happened in Texas, USA, 2013. I had undergone three very intense surgeries, two of which because I nearly lost my life, and the last of which left me with a physical disability for months.

This was the first major trauma I had endured and became incredibly depressed after being released as I could no longer make or keep friends and felt incredibly embarrassed about my obvious medical problem (an illeostomy bag and wound vac were implemented.)

My mom talked to my GI and he set me up an appointment with a female child psychologist. 

My grandparents who were my legal guardians along with my mom left immediately as directed by her, and the doctor began to ask me squarely questions about sex. This included describing and asking me if I'd heard about sexual acts like oral and anal. Despite assuring her I was not sexually active and showing real disgust she continued for a long time. She then had me dress down to a gown and lay on the bench with my legs up. She proceeded to pull down my gown and feel my breasts and also stick her finger inside and around my vagina. She did not inform my guardians about what she was doing before or after. Then my appointment was over, and I left feeling violated and more depressed.

I suppressed this memory for years until recently when I had to get an invasive procedure that went much differently in terms of explanation as to what was happening, having a female nurse present, and the obvious care for my comfort.

I am unfamiliar if the statute of limitations has passed or if I even have enough to make it worth it. If I do, I want to. She is old enough to still be working with children.

Thank you in advance.

EDIT: Typo

UPDATE: Mom confirmed she was a child psychologist, and never asked or requested to get my hymen checked, and she never suspected me to be sexually abused. So it is not looking great. Tomorrow we will begin to dig up my pedi records and get in touch with the pedi doctor who recommended her, since my mom said my pedi doctor highly recommended her and had used her for other patients dealing with depression and anxiety.

EDIT FOR EXTRA INFO: Ten years ago the region I lived in was mostly rural and the hospital served a mostly rural group. When I first started going the adult and pediatrics were mixed, but at this time they were changing the hospital to become an adult hospital and building/renovating for a Children's hospital. At the time of this event more people began to move to the area and the hospital began to spread out, as they received more specialists and more people wanted to work there and live there. The pediatric stuff was on one floor for about a year and a half. I went there for my anemia, my GI, and any infusion I needed (usually blood, iron, and at one point Crohns medicine). All the doctors offices looked the same and also acted as recovery rooms, IV rooms, and infusion rooms, and were not exclusive to one doctor, due to the upsizing of what was going to become a purely ""adult"" hospital and the creation of a purely ""children's"" hospital. The room I saw this lady in looked like a normal doctors office and for the talk portion I sat in a chair and she sat at a desk, and moved me to one of the medical beds that you'd see in any clinic room, and I was used to being on cause it's how my GI doctor would examine me. 

This hospital chain is now much larger than it was when I was a kid and has smaller clinics deeper into rural areas. I spent the last three years in pediatrics at the new children's hospital and had my physicals, general visits, blood tests, and therapist visits at the clinics closer to where I actually lived."

I got very drunk and blacked out my friends left and I decided to stay back for a few more dances this was a huge mistake.

I woke up the next day with no recollection of the night.

I put the charges on my Amex and don’t know what to do. I can’t dispute the charges because the strip club has cameras and technically I did buy the dance even though I don’t remember.

295,Can I win a lawsuit against the hospital that circumcised me as an infant?,"Hi all, I need some advice on this matter. I was circumcised as an infant. As far as I know the procedure wasn't ""botched"", as in, it didn't stick me with any other medical conditions. Although I know this is a common thing in the USA I still feel like less of a man and hate that it happened.

As far as I know my parents, technically being legal guardians at the time, consented, which means that there's nothing I can do. However I do not know the specifics, I'm not sure if written consent was given or only verbal, and I am certain she was given pain medicine which could invalidate consent, correct?

I believe what happened to me as an infant has given a gigantic hit to my self esteem and is resulting in some pretty heavy depression and anxiety, however I'm not sure how to prove this in a court, I mean how would I connect it? I could get a brain scan maybe, but if something was there how could it be connected to the circumcision? I mean it is to the point where I have trouble taking care of myself and responsibilities, such as getting out of bed or feeding myself, or hygiene or errands, and all of that is not necessarily resulting from what happened to me as an infant, as I have other troubles in life, but I believe it's a huge part of it.

I know of the hospital I was born in and the woman that delivered me, although I don't know for sure that she was the one who performed the circumcision.

That got the attention of the school who claimed they called the police to investigate.

The school is claiming it to be online bullying, but as far as every student is concerned no one is negatively impacted and this is just typical teen drama.

298,"(NE) Parents Forcing Me To Take Meds, What Can I Do?","Hi everyone. I am 19 years old, which is the legal age of adulthood in my state. However, upon turning 19, my parents were able to gain guardianship of me. This has proven to be a real loss for me, because now they have kicked me out of the house, taken my money, and put me in a group home where they and a psychiatrist are forcing me to take meds.

Now I assume that the best course of action here is for me to get guardianship back, and I am looking into this. I don't have the money for a lawyer but I plan to visit the courthouse one of these days and talk to one of the free lawyers at the help desk about filing for guardianship.

However, I have a real problem with meds. I am strongly, and I mean strongly, opposed to them. In my eyes, they violate my moral beliefs. I believe that my body is a sacred and holy thing and that taking pharmaceuticals such as these is a dangerous and harmful thing to my health. My question is, how can I use this to my advantage and take control of what goes into or out of my body? Can I take them to court about it? Can I talk to a judge and have the judge declare that I legally cannot be forced to take meds? What can I do?

Please only post helpful things, I don't want to hear about how I should just suck it up and take the meds.

300,growing fields of weed for russians while i was flippin dope,"So i have been growing weed for these russians (well kinda for my bro in law) my brother in law was picked up at a grow shop and asked if he would grow their weed, my brother in law was put in charge of 98 plants (2 sets of 48) and i was put to work, feeding, watering and doing really any work that the russians or my brother in law had to do or wanted done (they were lazy as sh&%) there were a few other people when i started but i was the only one who could really STAY working there seeing as how they were so greedy about the little money that DID come in that they hardly actually paid anyone, and I myself was selling dope (very effectively) and had enough money for my necessities aswell as many luxuries. The russians saw this but did not care seeing as how i would work a minimum of 6 hours a day with an upwards of 16 hours a day -- i worked every single day never had one day off ... my brother in law, slowly and passively building up resentment for my drug use & distribution (even though i bought his food and such) is the one that is receiving the payment currently (now that all 146 plants are harvested) and has brought me 4 pounds of good cut flower and 3 pounds for my girlfriend. because i was marked as a patient (with 6 plants) and i was also marked as a grower (my gf was not) --- for the hundreds of hours i slaved (literally 75 hours a week sometimes)  accepting maybe 100$ a week, i was givin 1000$ AND WAS TOLD that more money would be givin to me sometime that next week (about 6000$ left unpaid) 
IS THERE ANYWAY i could take them to court, for not giving me enough weed or money for the hours i worked? i dont wanna call in any favors to escalate things with them but i have made it clear (person to person innuendos) thats where this will lead them 

is there some marijuana enforcement agency that makes sure the grower and patient laws are aided by?  i am in oregon, and it was december that my grower and patient licence expired but i dont think that matters... any advice in anyway would be much appreciated thank you "
301,"Landlord damaged our property while evicting, can we sue in small claims court to get it count against our back rent we owe? (Wisco)","My girlfriend and I rented an apartment from an older woman (not like a corporate owned building). She used to work with us on back rent but eventually we were three months behind and she said we would have to move out Dec 1. We agreed but couldn't find a place and she agreed to extend it Dec 15. 

We found a place but we have jobs and couldn't move out so she said we had until Dec 19 to move out and that the extra days would all be added to our unpaid rent pro-rated (so three months and 19 days, about $2180).

We moved out all the furniture and stuff but still had a few things, some work clothes and some food/drink in the refrigerator and glasses/silverware in the cupboards. I should say we spent the night of Dec 19 at our new place and though for was OK we left a few things in the old place. In Wisconsin it was below zero temps and a blizzard which made moving harder. We mostly cared about the work clothes because my girlfriend needs to meet a dress code for her job. Well we weren't totally out by Dec 19. We came back and her adult son was there changing the locks. He said we were out of time and he was throwing away whatever was left. We threatened to call the cops and he said go ahead and left.

The cop came and listened to our story and said legally our tenancy was terminated Dec 19 since her and us agreed to that and even we moved out bc we weren't there. I should say we didn't have a lease and were just month to month. Ok. He said we could arrange a time with her to get our stuff back or handle it civilly in small claims court.

So we called her a bunch of times and finally got her. She said we could come back Dec 20 and get our stuff. My gf went over there and nobody was there, door still locked, but our shit was just outside the front door of the building in boxes. Our food and stuff froze and burst in the cold weather and some glasses and plates broken. We think this is pretty outrageous she let some of our food and stuff get ruined when she knows we're hard up for money. Also my girlfriend had to call in sick for work because she didn't have the right clothes to go to work on Dec 20.

We estimate $130 in damages ($80 in missed work and $50 in damaged possession) and would like it to count against the $2180 we owe her. We called and told her this and got all pissy, basically turned into a screaming match on the phone, and she said she cut us all these breaks and now we're fucking her around and we're pieces of shit and to pay we we owe her or she'll sue us and report us to credit reporting agencies. She also said there was damage beyond the $600 deposit and that she could add additional charges to our bill if she wanted.

Can we take her to small claims court to get the cost of the damages taken off our rent bill?"
302,Being harassed at work after nosy coworkers violated my privacy and took pics of me with my boyfriend. Mngmt will do nothing even as I'm being blatantly bothered. (Ohio),"I'll be upfront and say that I totally expect some heat from this post but please don't tell me I deserve it. I really just want honest advice.

I met my current boyfriend, who is in the process of seperating from his wife, at work. Before that I was in another relationship also in the workplace which caused some gossip but nothing insanely disturbing. The other day I found out that someone I work with had taken pictures without my consent of me kissing my boyfriend at a football game. The pictures have gone viral at work and now I'm being harassed by alot of different people. People are whispering about me behind my back and calling me a slut, people are threatening to call his wife and tell her about it, and are just doing things like treating me poorly and not talking to me, giving snide answers to innocent questions, or slamming doors on me.

Today I was confronted by a relative of his wife's in the bathroom. She cussed me out, called me a homewrecker, said that if we weren't at work she'd beat me up, and said to and I quote, watch my back. I pulled out my phone to record her but by the time I got it to record, I just got a clip of her saying that I should be embarrassed by behavior.  

All these things have been documented by me and given to supervisors but they just shrug it off and treat me really indifferently. HR has taken the stuff but literally done nothing with it. Now I just found out that a GoFund me is going around to support my boyfriend's wife, that says due to an 'individual' in the office, they will be divorcing and she'll need money. My coworkers are apparently circulating it via work email.

I feel like I'm constantly being slutshamed at work. I get it, I know why people are being judgey but it's none of their business and no one has any right to be so nasty to me. Do I have a case if I take this to an employment lawyer especially since pics were taken without my consent? Is that a violation of my privacy? Will a cease and desist letter from a lawyer help HR take this seriously? Thanks for any answers I can get."

Before we start, just know I realize how fast I was going and regret it, so no point in commenting how silly I was by going that fast. 

I was using the dotted-white-line entrance of the express lane to pass cars and was subsequently pulled over. I had my license and registartation ready and was very cordial with the cop. Right off the bat he listed off my speed and told me he was going to issue a court citation. 

He wrote me up a summon and let me be on my way. My court date is not for another 1.5 months which I thought seemed fairly long away.

I am 22, just recently got a new car, and am ready to accept the consequences of my actions. However, I am wondering if there's any advice you can share on how I can up my chances of getting off on an easier charge. 

Given this is my first citation, is there a chance I will go to jail? I'm a little anxious about that...."

I went to this place near where I work and they showed me the price list - men’s waxings were automatically 50% more money but OK whatever I pay.

I get into the room. And the woman schedules to wax me takes one look at my crotch and runs out saying “nope I’m not doing that”.

I honestly can only guess at why she felt that way but I imagine it’s because my penis is on the larger side (7”) and I was semi-erect at the time.

I said fine can you please assign someone else and they said “no you’d better just leave”.

I asked for a refund and they told me to go fuck myself and had the mall security remove me from the premises.

306,[AZ] ‘Grounds’ to raise in a Federal habeas corpus petition?,"Hello legal scholars,

My girlfriend has been misdiagnosed by the mental health industry, who is using an order of the court to force her to submit to harmful treatment. I've hit a dead end in the state courts, and intend to file another habeas corpus petition in the US District court. I would greatly appreciate your insights into how to best word the ""grounds"" to raise. 

# Backstory

When the first hospital wouldn't let my girlfriend leave once she'd recovered from her alcohol withdrawal episode, I ran across the term [habeas corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States) in the Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) section on [Judicial Review](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00546.htm).  Not being familiar with the term, I consulted with wikipedia. “Oh, how useful.” (At the time A.R.S. 36-546 did not yet apply to my girlfriend, as she had not yet been ordered by the court to submit to the mental health system.)

The next day I wrote a note that politely asked the hospital to release my girlfriend. She signed it, we delivered this to a hospital employee, and I was promptly passive-aggressively banned from the premises. So I wrote a petition for writ of habeas corpus and took it to the superior court. The commissioner evaluated my filing, decided there was [prima fascie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie) evidence that my girlfriend was being illegally detained, and ordered a hearing for the next day. 

At the hearing the commissioner informed that the hospital had emailed to say they weren’t going to come. She further said that she’d investigated the hospital's filings with the county's mental health court, found that the hospital’s 48 hour involuntary hold had expired, and ruled that my girlfriend was to be released, unless the hospital filed a proper “petition for court-ordered evaluation”. 

I made two mistakes in this first habeas corpus case:

* I assumed the hospital’s legal department would be on the hospital's property (pre-hearing). My process server knew where the legal department was, but I couldn't afford another $300...
* I should have called the police to accompany me back onto the hospital’s property, and extract my girlfriend from their court-certified illegal custody (post-hearing).

I was attacked by an ex-cop security guard, who knew just what to say to get me arrested. I went to jail, and my girlfriend got sucked into the make-work mental health system. The petition for court-ordered evaluation was filed 3 days after my habeas corpus hearing. 

# Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here

The mental health industry is every bit as stupid as I suspected - they violate every principle and maxim that has helped modern doctors to stop [killing their patients](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/theodoric-of-york/n8661). My girlfriend briefly escaped after six months of palliative treatments that only worsened her tendency to self-medicate. I got her into another county, where they allowed the harmful tranquilizers (""[anti-psychotics](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2013/antipsychotics-taking-the-long-view.shtml)"") to temporarily lapse. 

She got a job, and was doing well. But the damage caused by harmful prescriptions doesn’t magically go away as soon as you stop taking them. She had a “stressful” second day of work, resumed drinking… arrested → inescapable stress → “drug therapy” (rip-off) → malnourishment → inescapable stress → street drug relapse → resumption of forced administration of tranquilizers → “Dual diagnosis drug treatment” (more inescapable stress)…

# Judicial Trickery

I petitioned the new county’s court for another writ of habeas corpus. Instead of doing her job, the judge “tweaked” the statutes so she wouldn’t have to cause problems for the community’s mental health provider. My petition was dismissed “[without prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_term)) to the proper procedural filings.” 

I did what the order of dismissal said “must” be done. It didn’t work, so I revised & re-filed. Twice. After the third dismissal I realized that the judge had abdicated her duty to justice. 

The three orders of dismissal quote A.R.S. 36-546(A)(1) (second link above) as:
> “A request in writing **must** be “presented to *any member of the treatment staff of the agency* providing the patient’s treatment. The request may be made on a prescribed form that shall be prepared by *the facility* and made available for use by any person.”

Italics and mismatched quotation marks as used in the orders of dismissal. Bold is my emphasis. 

The actual Section 36-546(A) reads (link above) as:

> A. **In addition to the procedure for applying for a writ of habeas corpus, as provided in [title 13](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=13), chapter 38, article 26,** a patient receiving court-ordered treatment or any person acting on the patient's behalf may request the patient's release pursuant to the following: 
> 1. A request in writing *may* be presented to any member of the treatment staff of the agency providing the patient's treatment. The request may be made on a prescribed form that shall be prepared by the facility and made available for use by any person. The completed form shall identify: [...]
> 
> (bold/italic emphasis added)

([13-4121](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/04121.htm) and [13-4122](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/04122.htm) are the two most-relevant parts of title 13.)

See what the judge did there? The statute used to justify the dismissal of my habeas corpus petition clearly indicates that my petition is allowed as provided elsewhere. This statute just provides an additional procedural remedy that may be used to initiate judicial review on behalf of someone else. The orders of dismissal changed 'may' to ‘must’. I didn’t fully appreciate the trickery until after I’d already filed my notice of appeal, after the 3rd identical dismissal.

The Court of Appeals panel dismissed my appeal for lack of jurisdiction, but didn’t comment on how it was okay for the judge to completely change the wording of the law to justify her dismissal. Their dismissal also said they’d looked to see if I’d complied with the judge’s misreading of the law, but conveniently overlooked the certified mail post card & receipt that proved I’d done what the judge said “must” be done to initiate judicial review on behalf of someone else.

I next petitioned the Supreme Court for review. Quorum is 3; the chief justice & vice-chief justice were on the panel of 4 that decided to deny my petition for review. Hrmph.

# Federal Court 

Since the Arizona state courts have refused to do their job, I can petition the US District Court. Habeas corpus is usually used by prisoners. My girlfriend is now being forced to stay at the drug treatment facility, so she’s just as much a prisoner as any other inmate. 

The [provided form](http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/forms/prisoner-form-petition-writ-habeas-corpus-person-state-custody-pursuant-28-usc-%C2%A7-2254) says: 

> “For this petition, **state every ground on which you claim that you are being held in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.** Attach additional pages if you have more than four grounds. State the facts supporting each ground.” (emphasis added)

This is where I’d appreciate /r/legaladvice's insights. These are some of the grounds that I am considering raising in my next petition:

* Ground #1: Denial of [procedural due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_due_process) –  I think the judge’s “rewording of the law” falls under this category…  

    * My girlfriend’s treatment is in nearly-complete non-compliance with the requirements of [A.R.S. Title 36](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=36), Chapter 5. The reference to habeas corpus ([A.R.S. 36-546](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00546.htm)) is the only safeguard, but this is meaningless if the judges decide that it’s too inconvenient to tell the mental health profiteers that they can’t actually do whatever they want to people. Does my girlfriend's treatment's non-compliance with the requirements of state law fall under denial of procedural due process?

    * refusal to provide ""Some Kind of Hearing""
    * New evidence: my videos that prove friend is 100% innocent of the charge of having a 'mental disorder'. She was fine 2 weeks before her first hospitalization. I didn't realize I had videos until a year after the court found my friend to have a ""persistent or acute disability""...
    * I/she/we have been denied “the opportunity to be heard.”)
    * Judge protecting the community's mental health provider is not a 'neutral-decision maker'
    * ex-parte applications for court-ordered evaluation by hospitals also denied opportunity to be heard. 

* Ground #2: Denial of [substantive due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process) –  I think forcing people to take palliative drugs would qualify as denial of this right. People get psychotic for various reasons. A mental health system that respects people’s rights might wait for people to recover (like they used to, before the FDA approved “maintenance medicines”…), instead of forcibly ""stabilizing"" them with harmful prescription drugs. 

    A line on that wikipedia page says substantive due process protects the rights of ""discrete and insular minorities"".
    
    “To justify deprivation of fundamental rights, substantive due process requires the action: 
    - Furthers a compelling state interest
    - Is the least-restrictive/intrusive alternative” - [The Illegality of Psychiatric Imprisonment - slides used in the youtube video](http://psychrights.org/education/PsychOut2011/PsychOut2011IllegalPsychiatry.pdf)
    
    There is no “legitimate government purpose” in using court orders to make people profitable to the mental health industry. Yes, some people are violent crazies, but by treating people with palliative drugs that make people worse (Thomas Insel's NIMH blog post, linked above, etc), the government's legitimate purpose should be in forcing the mental health industry to adopt less-profitable effective practices.

    Is forcing a person to take FDA-approved drugs that worsen their actual problems a substantive due-process violation?

    Is the vague finding of “persistent or acute disability” ([A.R.S. 36-501](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00501.htm), #36) a procedural due process violation, or a substantive due process violation?

* Ground #3 – Denial of 'equal protection'.  Habeas corpus is the only way to review the treatment received by persons subject to orders for court-ordered treatment. The Arizona constitution forbids suspension of habeas corpus, but my judge’s re-wording of the law says persons accused of having a ""mental disorder"" and/or subjected to orders for court-ordered treatment have no access to the courts except through the assistance of the abusive mental health agency’s medical director and an apathetic public defender. 

    “The U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Waley v. Johnson (1942) interpreted this authority broadly to allow the writ to be used to challenge convictions or sentences in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights where no other remedy was available. [...]” [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Federal_law)

* Ground #4 – Ineffective assistance of counsel. 

    - 1st public defender didn’t know “methadone-induced alcoholism” was an entirely-reasonable defense against the charge of being “persistently disabled”. (A.R.S. 36-501 #25 distinguishes “mental disorders” from conditions caused by drug & alcohol abuse.  Public defending mental patients is surely not the most glamorous job in the public defense profession, but the statutes aren’t that complex… Shouldn’t a public defender take a little time to become familiar with them?
    - 2nd public defender (when order for treatment was issued) should have demanded my testimony. They didn't have an address for me, so my summons was never sent. Furthermore, my girlfriend's parents really wanted the order for treatment issued, because they thought the mental health professionals would try to help their daughter (lol). The second public defender also should have called expert witnesses to refute the state's advocation that maintenance with palliative drugs was the only effective treatment option. 
    - Girlfriend’s current public defender is actively refusing to provide services. 

* Ground #5 – Infliction of “cruel and unusual punishment”. Forcing people to take prescriptions that makes them suicidal is cruel. Forcing a recovering cocaine user to take prescription drugs that make them [want to use more cocaine](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-011-2231-6) is also cruel, especially when we now know [how to eliminate cocaine cravings](http://www.statepress.com/article/2017/09/spscience-asu-professors-fight-addiction-with-drugs).

* Ground #7 – reservation of rights. Should I mention this? Does the right to refuse medical care falls under this ground as well?  

* Ground #8 – less intrusive approaches to helping improving someone’s health than forcing them to take suicide-ideation pills. Simply implementing “present medical knowledge” instead of maintenance tranquilizers would be enough. 

* Ground #9 – chain of custody considerations? I maintain that my girlfriend was human-trafficked into the mental health system. 

* Ground #10 - Should I mention something about evidentiary standards?

307,[MI] pre-birth DNA testing?,"I'm on mobile so sorry for any grammatical or formatting errors. 

So I reside in Michigan my ex gf is pregnant with whom we both believe is my kid. The issue is that I believe she has a mental illness. She can't hold a job nor does she have any motivation to better herself. She has no G.E.D. and no money. Being in a relationship with her was TOXIC. 

She lives in a chaotic environment and her grandmother is verbally abusive. When the baby is born it will be in her small cluttered room in a pack and play. 

While on the other hand I have my own place with an extra bedroom. I work full time and go to school full time for a BBA in accointing. I save 200 dollars every paycheck with excellent health benefits with the company I work for. 

I believe that I would be the best fit parent for the child, but because we are not married I have no rights therefore, I have to get ""proof"" that I am the father. This involves DNA testing. 

I'm afraid that if I don't establish paternity asap then I will be automatically considered ""lazy"" by the court system because she is not allowing me doctor visitations, and she currently has me blocked through all forms of communication. I was told that she posts badly about me on social media as well. 

Before I get an attorney I am curious about pre-natal DNA testing. Does anybody know if you can get a court order for this before the baby is born so I can know and have proof asap that he's mine? I seriously can not picture my child being raised in that household it makes me want to throw up honestly. 

If anyone has any information or advice please feel free to comment. 

EDIT: With all of the deadbeat fathers out there I'm surprised that I'm getting my a** handed to me here on this sub.

EDIT 2: Essentially alls I obtained from this thread was flame, and personal attacks on me. I'm requesting for this post to be removed."
308,I shoplifted today...now what?,"I (22) shoplifted from Old Navy. 2items around $50 in total. Just walked out with them. I don’t know why I did this. I didn’t get the rush people talk about. I seriously don’t know why I did it. 
I leave the store with the items and no one stopped me or probably even knew I did it. 
If they have security cameras and was caught, will they call the police? What happens in situations like this? 
I don’t plan on doing this again. I actually want to take the items back but talk about drawing attention to myself. I have NO EXCUSE for what I did and am ashamed of myself. I have a lot of stress going on in my life and maybe that’s why I did it. Please don’t lecture me on how wrong it was, because i know it was horrible.

309,(CA) I've created a hostile work inviroment at a ski resort?,"Hey all and thanks in advance to all that read and comment. I'm an active lurker of this sub, participate when I can, but this is an alt account for obv reasons. 

Its a pretty simple situation and I think I'm not getting the fair end here. 

On my day off (after a 10 day work streak), post a long day of skiing the best snow we've had all year, I bellied up to the bar while my partners finished riding. I started to drink. 

When my buddies arrived, I already had a pretty solid buzz; Half from libations and half from the epic day of skiing. 

I welcomed them in and they took seats at the bar. One of my buddies let me know there was a conditions reporter sitting at a table about 20 ft away from the bar. A conditions reporter works for marketing and thier job is to post attractive blurbs on our web site sumerizing the snow and trail conditions. This one in perticular has really ruffled my feathers. For weeks, she's been out right lying about the conditions. It's upset a lot of staff, and even more patrons. I have people yell at me, directly, because they drove from SF bay to the resort, a 3+ hour trip, based on this girls reporting. Upon arrival, they're obvioulsy disappointed. 

Welp, in my elevated state, I spoke up. They weren't kind words, but they were the truth. I told her she doesn't deserve to be published and her lies are such garbage. It went on, and my language got colorful. 

Her boyfriend (?) got out of his chair and rushed me. My buddy stopped him, but he was able to get ahold of me and shake me a bit. No punches. The bartender, a friend I respect, told me to chill out and immediatly did. He's a solid source of reason, and I rested because he's almost always right. 

We close out, grab our gear, and my buddy takes me home. 

I come to work the next day, and I have to help with a big group getting rentals. Turns out her office is in this rental building. 

Later that day, she went to HR and said she feels threatened at work. She felt extra threatened because I was so close to her office (I usually work right on the snow all day). 

My manager called me off and said we've got a meeting with HR. Boo. 

I went in and tried to describe my side. It was, admittedly, blurry. 

I'm told there will be an investigation and I need to stay out of that rental office for the time being. That's okay with me, I was doing that work pro bono anyhow. 

I was never really ""suspended."" I was still being scheduled on busy days and for specialized projects. Projects that I could do better (or I was the only available for) than other employees. 

Things were cool for about a week, then this reporter shows up, unnanouced and uninvited, into my work area. I ignored it, took it as a good sign, and kept with my day. 

Now I'm being told by my immediate boss I should resign before we meet with HR. Its taken nearly 2 weeks for the HR rep to make an appointment to see us. I was working the entire time. 

The HR rep said she was going to gather witness reports and make a descion. She hasn't even tried to contact anyone on my behalf. All the reports are from the conditions reporter's friends. My buddy that I skiied with all day, and who drive me home, saw that dude come up and try to fight me. HR hasn't even talked with the bartenders. 

Is that all it takes for me to lose a job? Just a compliant about feeling threatened? I have never ever been in any trouble here. Quite the opposite: Our survey site has about 30 very high reviews from customers about me over the past few years. I've been employee of the week a few times. My managers know me as a dedicated and extremely hard worker, more than willing to get it done. I've never even missed an optional training. As a matter of fact, soon I'll have an accreditation that puts me pretty high in my industry. 

I've been given the chance to quit before I get fired. I don't really want to collect unemployment, but I need to consider that now, too. 

Do I quit? Do I need to lawyer up? Should I fight it and run the risk of not being hired at this resort again? Does it make a difference this was my day off? Why isn't she getting witness statements that could help me?

E: I just read this post again for the xth time. I want to let y'all know I'm not proud of myself. I'm frankly embarrassed. I don't drink often, and I let the booze take control. That's not an excuse. As soon as I was called into the HR office, I told the manager I really want to find this girl and apologize directly to her (which they said is strictly forbidden, I get that). I really love this resort, and I could get a job in a day at another one around the area, but that's not what I want. I have a solid support staff and I some good return clientele. "

My friends sister is 25 but she still lives with her parents because she has down syndrome. We were talking the other day while I was at his (my friend's) house and we could have had sex but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to have sex with her (legally). 

I'm going around to their house tomorrow and I can probably do it again. She wanted to do it too (I imagine that she doesn't get a lot of suitors) but I just don't want to get in trouble."

Hello reddit, a few months ago I tried to purchase a 2007 bmw z4 M coupe online. They were very nice over the phone, went through all the steps a dealer would, send me legitimate looking contracts and documents. I went ahead with the sale. I wired $21,700 to a major national bank in Miami, FL and was told to wait till friday for delivery of the vehicle. The vehicle never showed up.
 Shorty after the website went down and the phone was disconnected.
 Uh oh.
 I tried everything to get the money back from wire reversals (he already cleaned out the account) to CFPB complaints. I tried police reports, online report to the FBI cyber crimes division. I tried the FTC. The major well known national bank sent a hold harmless agreement to my bank to initiate the wire recall but the account was cleared out so there was nothing to send back. Even they admitted it was a scam! I only did the wire because it was going to a major national bank and not western union or moneygram. Why do I have this burden when allowed a scammer to use them as a front? I even emailed the board of directors and the CEO herself! At this point my bank has given up, The scammers bank wont talk to me anymore, and I cant find a lawyer that will take this on. Im in the Air Force active duty and have spoken to the base lawyers and they told me im screwed. Any help?"
312,"Moved countries, landlord wouldn't let out of old lease.","I rented an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin for a 12 month lease. I switched universities in December and am now living in another country for the time being. I told the manager of the building that I would be moving in December/January, and I would have to break the lease. He said I could sublet the apartment. I looked for anyone interested, but no one was willing to pay the outrageous rent. Fair enough. I told the manager of the building this, and he said not to worry as he's sure someone will come by in December or January at the latest in search of an apartment. The apartment was cleared out, I left the keys inside, and went on my merry way. 




Fast forward to April, I haven't heard anything from the manager and assumed he had quickly found someone... Then I get an email saying I owe them 4 months worth of rent. I email the manager saying he never informed me he stopped looking/couldn't find anyone to take the apartment when he knew the situation. I'm in no financial position to pay 2 rents and pay off 4 months worth of rent on a place I don't live in. I receive an email back from ""N"", who I assume is the manager's higher up, stating it was my responsibility to find someone for the apartment and I owe them this money. She then sent me an email stating the apartment had used more utilities than it should for the past quarter (the months the apartment was empty), and if it exceeded the maximum amount, I would be charged for that too.




I'm confused on what to do or what I can do. I couldn't keep paying two rents. I informed the landlords/managing company ahead of time. I was reassured they would find someone immediately and not to worry about it. Now I'm being told I have to pay rent on it AND that the utilities bill is higher than it should be... Even though the apartment should be empty and the utilities shouldn't be being used (besides the fridge which I don't think is $450 worth of utilities). 



Do I have any legal grounds to defend myself? I physically cannot pay it as I'm a broke student with racked up debt, and my cosigner is my mother who is just as poor as I am. 



Thank you!"
313,Is it true that I don’t technically have to pay off my credit card?,"First let me say I am responsible and in a completely fine financial situation, and would never do this, this just peaks my curiosity of the technicality of cards. 

Its my understanding that credit cards are “unsecured debt” and the creditor assumes a risk of non-payment with no collateral. So legally can I max out my $12,000 capital one card and just never pay it and never answer collections when they inevitably call?

314,"I lied and said I hooked up with a girl at a party, now the whole school thinks I'm a rapist, please help me","I am 17 years old, a senior in high school, live in Michigan  and a virgin. School started last week and there was a big party on Friday night. Under normal circumstances I would have never been invited but I let it slip that I could cop Xanax for the party. This is the first in many poor decisions. 

Okay, so I'm basically a nerd I have a few buddies but that's it. We're not cool enough to get drugs under normal circumstances but what I did was order LEGAL clonazolam powder. It's a research chemical and a benzo just like Xanax so what I did was I got this pill press too and I pressed the powder to look kind of like Xanax bars. I figured no one would know the difference since most pills out there are pressed anyways. I brought my %100 legal pressed pills to the party and I was right kids couldn't tell the difference. I ducked up again when pressing the pills I made them way too strong.

So there's this girl I've had a crush on all summer. She took a pill and was drinking too. Not everyone took my phony pills but the kids who did got super fucked up including my crush. Keep all of this in mind. Okay, so I brag to my buddies who were not invited that I hooked up with this girl when I definitely did not. I didn't think they'd tell anybody, but they immediately called me on my bullshit and took it way too far. My ""best"" friend who's sister is a freshman and good friends with my crushes younger sister well he told his baby sister that I hooked up with her and she told my crushes sister and it got back to my crush who apparently blacked out that night and freaked the fuck out because she thinks I took advantage of her at some point during the party. Everyone believes this even my ""friends"" think I'm a rapist. I didn't even go to fucking school today because my phone has been blowing up with random numbers calling me names, outright threatening me etc. I deleted all of my social media because of the same thing. Guys were threatening to kick my ass.

I have no idea what to do. What if she actually tries to press charges against me? I'm fucked. "
315,Is it legal to require a prospective employee (who was fired in the past) to bring in cookies to be hired again?,"Hired a teenager to do some cleanup at minimum wage on a construction site.  Teenager trained/given appropriate work garb, but then had a few no call/no show in a row and was let go.  Teenager came in to apologize, says he worked out a new plan with his parents, would like to be rehired.  Kind of on the fence about hiring him back.  Is it legal to ask him to bring in some cookies to be rehired?

&#x200B;

What if I offer to reimburse the cost of the cookies in his first paycheck after he's worked a couple weeks without being fired again?"
316,[CO] how legally binding are spay/neuter contracts for puppies?,"I'm researching getting a labradoodle puppy (allergies) for my family. I've noticed almost all the local breeders have some type of spay/neuter contract. I don't plan on breeding the dog, but it doesn't sit right with me. 

The agreements read that if the dog is not neutered by 9 months of age (with written proof sent in) the dog is to be surrendered back to the breeder along with $7,000 in 'damages'. Original payment for the dog (1500) is also surrendered, of course. If the dog becomes intentionally or unintentionally pregnant before it is spayed or nuetered, the dog and all the puppies are to be surrendered to the breeder the dog came from along with that 7k fine. To have 'rights' to an intact dog these breeders are charging 10k.

I'm wondering how enforceable this contract is? We're also military, if that matters, so we'll be crossing state lines before that 9 Mos is up.

I'm not looking to swindle anybody or get into dog breeding, but this feels kind of ridiculous. Maybe I just view my dog's balls differently. "
317,Someone please read this and tell me if I have anything to worry about.,"Florida. Recently my girl had been acting strange. She wouldn’t sleep with me and she was spending more nights over with her friends. We have been dating for 3 years, living happily together for 2 and a half. One day she left and said she’s be back around 6pm and wasn’t back until 4 am and she broke up with me right when she walked in the door. I was devastated. I begged for her back over and over and over. She said her mind was made up. 

So today when she left I looked at her laptop. Turns out it was synced with her messages and she had been sleeping with a guy for over a month. She said terrible things about me and said she would dump me kick me out and take our mutual pet. I say mutual because we always split the cost but the insurance and the vet gave him registered to me , but rightly it is hers a well. I took out pet, took all the stuff I thought was important and leftZ I took nothing of hers. Or damaged anything of hers I am currently in a hotel. She won’t stop calling. I called her a lot of names like a bitch and a slut but now I won’t answers .

So I know I am weak and a piece of work, but please help me I have never been this hurt and I have never done anything like this. 


Can I get in trouble for looking at her laptop?
Can I get in trouble for taking our mutual pet?"
318,[California] Someone made a Facebook account using photos of me covered in semen that I posted on Twitter and sent friend requests to my family. What do I do? :(,"This morning I woke up to a call phone from my mom crying. Someone tried to add her on Facebook posing as me. They used photos I posted on my Twitter of myself about a week ago. I was tutoring this guy I had a crush on and posted us studying together. Well, one thing led to another, and we end up having sex. He came all over my face. In the heat of the moment I posted a selfie with his cum on my Twitter. It got hundreds of likes- I have 10,000 followers. This morning someone made a fake Facebook account with my name on it using the selfie of me I posted. I DID NOT give them permission. Apparently they’re going around adding my friends and family on Facebook to show off my selfie and also posting the picture of the other dude. I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. My friends are reporting the page as fake, but what else can I do? I have no idea who would do this!!!"
319,"Traded in too many iphones to Apple, Got banned from shopping in-store. Still have $6000 in Apple Store GCs they won't let me spend.","Long story short, took advantage of the MetroPCS free iPhone 6s deal.
Traded in somewhere between 80-100 phones for $200 GC each back in December.  Typically 10-12 at a time between many Apple stores in the Bay Area.  Promo changed slightly end of Dec early Jan where you were required to make purchase with trade-in for full $200 value, or opt for $100 GC instead.  So with future trades, id buy apple watches, then return them to receive full $200 back in a GC.  Total count of phones traded in somewhere between 150-175 maybe.

Yes it was a lot of work, and I kept busy signing up at many metroPCS etc.  Over 30k in Apple GCs most of which I sold off.  Now recently, on my last return of Apple watches in Sacramento, manager called Loss prevention at corporate... Came out and told me they will return my watches, but I will no longer be able to do any trade ins or returns related to trade-ins at any Apple store in the state. This was a week ago.

As of today, I went to Apple store Valley Fair to go return an Iphone and airpods (This guy wanted to buy them from me but flaked) and right before I was able to return, the senior manager came out and told me that I am not allowed to do any business in the store.  It even got worse because the two people I was meeting to sell giftcards to were unable to purchase anything from Apple because of their ""association"" with me.

Obviously I'm no saint.  I abused this promo to the fullest extent to profit.  But I broke 0 laws and did not violate any terms and conditions.  Most Apple stores were fine with what I was doing but it took one rep and one phone call to shut me down.

So now I have 6k In gcs that they won't let me use... and since these hold actual value, is it legal to prevent me from spending them?  Obviously I can shop online but I will have a hell of a time combining GCs, and what if I was a dumbass who doesn't know how to shop online?

In any case, I called Apple and senior advisors told me they cant do anything to lift the ban because it was stores discretion , yet the apple reps told me to call Apple.

So any info would be great.  Thanks :)"
320,Accommodations Allowed in Court for Therians Just as for Transgender?,"California: **Since transgender defendants may wear accommodations to relieve distressing mismatches between their anatomy and their self-image, is it similar for mismatches resulting from other parts of one's identity (eg. species,) provided the accommodations (eg. so-called ""nekomimi"" attire) place no undue burden on the courts and are screened for possible safety risks?**

 If yes, why? If no, why? (Edited to simplify. I apologize I missed the ""simple legal questions"" rule.) "

326,medical bills after being transported to hospital?,"I fell asleep outside, paramedic thought I was overdosing, I was coherent and not overdosing, i was transported to the hospital anyway. Medical bills are expensive. The documents are falsified saying narcotics overdose and listing symptoms of that when there's no possibility I've actually overdosed on narcotics. I had only taken Xanax but release papers say nothing about that and also spelled my name incorrectly. I'm annoyed because this all costs money and I was not overdosing on illegal drugs. I don't think I should have to pay any of this because I said to the paramedic many times that I was not overdosing and I was definitely awake. Can this be safely ignored considering my name is spelt wrong? I honestly don't think I should have to pay this.

327,Can urgent care refuse debts paid in pennies,"Arizona:

I had a 1 month lapse in healthcare coverage during a time when I had a severe allergic reaction, I went to an urgent care facility, talked to a nurse for a bit, and was basically told to just go to the ER, that they couldn't help me. 

This same urgent care were the ones that gave me medication that I was severely allergic to.

So I went to the ER and incurred hundreds of dollars in debts, which I will deal with later, but:

The urgent care still charged me for the visit. I tried to dispute that with them since they basically did nothing for me but they said because I spoke with the nurse that I owed them money. 

So I owe them money. Obviously I'm pissed, and you can judge me for this all you want but I would like some advice here.

I want to pay the bill in pennies. I know that private business can refuse certain forms of payment for services not yet rendered but 

Can they legally refuse legal tender such as pennies for the payment of medical debts? 

Thanks in advance. I know this is a silly idea but I literally have no recourse here, they did nothing for me and I just can't sleep at night knowing they're going to fuck me like this without any repercussions."
328,Does a mom have to give back child support if DNA proves the wrong dad paid?,"So let's say I have a friend ""Mary."" She was hooking up a few different guys, nothing serious, and got knocked up. She wasn't positive who the dad was but decided to settle down with the most stable guy (let's call him ""Bob"") who could give her baby the best life.

They were on again off again and ""Mary"" didn't put ""Bob"" on the birth certificate when her baby was born because we were ""off again"" at this point of time. We lived together for a while, ""Bob"" was a jerk, and they broke up. ""Mary"" started getting child support money from ""Bob.""

After they broke up ""Mary"" reconnected with ""Tom,"" who she had been hooking up with at the same time as ""Bob."" ""Bob"" finds this out and because he is a vindactive asshole he tells me he wants a paternity test to prove our son is his. He also says that because he isn't on the birth certificate he doesn't have to pay, and that ""Mary"" has to give back what he paid. 

That would never happen right? I told him it doesn't matter what he can prove because he was the babies father all this time and it's in the baby's best interest now that he continue to pay for our support.

""Mary"" is pretty sure ""Tom"" is actually the father, but ""Bob"" was the one who raised the baby. He got all the perks of being a dad and gets to spend time with the baby. The baby is HIS son in that since, no matter what the DNA test says. Right?

So would the court agree that DNA doesn't matter anymore because ""Bob"" is already the established dad?

330,My job is asking for FMLA forms while my mom is dying - do I have to comply?,"I work in Maryland, and my mom is in Kentucky. She has terminal cancer and has gone downhill quickly in the past week. I flew in on Sunday to spend time with her (she had been in the hospital over a week at that point) while I still can.   


I'm not sure how long I'll be here. At first, we thought she might be getting a little better and leaving the hospital, so I was planning a short trip. But, she's only got worse each day and hasn't been able to eat really in over a week and hasn't passed any food out the other end at all. So, I've decided to stay longer, but I'm still not sure how long. I don't know if she will recover and go home, it seems unlikely, but still possible. Or, she could decline quickly any day and pass - and then I'd need to be here for arrangements, services, and dealing with her assets and all that. I'm 43 and my mom is 68, I've never been through anything like this before.  


The people I work with have known the situation for a while (she's been fighting cancer for over a year). I let them know when I was traveling in on Sunday and my boss, and my boss's boss all told me just to go and not worry about work (I work in an office setting). But, today I contacted my boss and let them know I'd be out all week instead of just part of the week. Then I (maybe made a mistake) and asked if there was anything I needed to do with HR for being out an extended amount of time. My boss said they'd check and get back to me.   


HR is now involved and wants me to fill out Family Medical Leave Act forms. There is one form just for me that asks for a return date (which I don't really know, but can put something down). But then, they have a second form that they want my mom's doctor to fill out. I've not even met her doctor in person yet, only over the phone. She's supposed to be at the hospital today and I feel awful asking the person who is taking care of my dying mom to take time to fill out this form that feels to me like a ""get out of school"" card.   


The form is:  OMB Control Number: 1235-0003   


It asks for details of her medical conditions, and frankly questions I find insensitive and insulting like:  


* Will the patient be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment and recovery? 
* Estimate the beginning and ending dates for the period of incapacity:  
* Explain the care needed by the patient and why such care is medically necessary: 
*  Explain the care needed by the patient, and why such care is medically necessary: 
*  Describe other relevant medical facts, if any, related to the condition for which the patient needs care (such medical facts may include symptoms, diagnosis, or any regimen of continuing treatment such as the use of specialized equipment): 

It's hard enough dealing with what my mom is going through, and to ask all these stupid and intrusive questions just adds insult on top of that. And, I really want to be focused on her, not covering my ass to get out of work. Don't these questions also violate HIPPA regulations? Why should my job know the details of my dying mom's health condition? Am I just being over-sensitive to this? Do I need to comply with these forms or risk not being able to use my sick leave?

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and/or respond."
331,Tapped another persons car. Not sure if definitely my fault (CA),"So I live in this pretty small apartment complex and I was going out to my car about ready to leave. My complex has a narrow U shaped driveway going around and connecting to the main road and along the driveway is a big red line with FIRE LANE NO PARKING across it. One of our neighbors likes to park on it very often to wash their car and it just so happens to block our cars way out (just by a bit since this driveway can fit just about two cars side to side). I got into my car, not realizing that they were parked there and while talking to my son, accidentally tapped the side of my car. I know that chances are, I’m probably partially  at fault for not paying attention, but could there be some doubt as to whether I was completely at fault due to how they were parked in a no parking area that obstructed my way out?

332,Can anyone advise on the legality of a store requesting to see your receipt as you're walking out?,"I don't have a specific incident in mind but it drives me crazy when I go to a store and they want to see a receipt for my items. This happens to me a lot because I do not use plastic bags so sometimes I carry out in my hands (in this instance I totally understand!), but sometimes I put in my purse or my reusable bags and I get a ton of questions. IMO, it's dehumanizing to have to show my receipt every time for something I legally purchased. This happens to me 2x a week. 

I'm of the understanding that the store can't legally force me to show my receipt, but they could call police if they felt there was any shoplifting going on & then I would of course be required to comply. Does this vary by state?

It hasn’t happened since but we’re coming to around the time it happened last month so I’m worried it might happen again.

Is there any way I can legally protest this at a public school? Does freedom of speech and expression still apply?"
334,FRIEND AND MOM CAUGHT STEALING,"

Okay, so my friend and mom went to the mall. They saw an employee throwing clothes in front of Victoria Secret and stupidly thought it was free. My mom thought it was free, and she told the rest of her friends that it was free. They grabbed stuff and left but HONEST TO GOD they thought it was free. My friend would never purposely steal. They’re from India so they don’t really know about this stuff. Swear to god. One doesn’t even speak English. 

A security guard caught them and they tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening to a word they were saying. He banned them from the mall for a year, and said he was definitely presses and didn’t believe them. 

So, we really don’t know about this stuff and we have a few questions.

How do we find out if he’ll be pressing charges or not? Will the police call us? If he is, how do we get it out from our record? Do we need a lawyer? How much would that lawyer cost? Do we need a really good one? 

Texas

Btw, my friend is from India and she’s a OBT. She’s currently working in America. Will this mess things up? Will this be on her visa and affect her going to India and coming back here? Will they not let her back in?

335,"Specifics of traveling abroad (Middle East and Europe) with drugs (in this case, scheduled meds: Tramadol and Lyrica)","Hi everyone, I hope this is the right forum; I'll go straight to the point, I invited my parents to travel to Israel, Jordan and Italy, anyway, I'm taking tramadol and Lyrica daily, and a lot and the travel will last around 15 days, this means I will have to take A LOT of Tramadol and Lyrica; also, my parents don't know about this, so I was wondering, how could I take the meds I need without any problems? If carry them with me will I be checked? If they check it would be really embarrassing, I won't have a legitimate reason to have them and my parents will find out and I don't want that; I was thinking, since I'm from Mexico, maybe they will decide to check everything I have, so how could I get past security with my stash of the meds I take? I'm not trying to smuggle anything and not willing to do anything illegal, it's just the meds I take because I'm an addict. I was thinking about putting them all in bottles of other harmless meds, but supposing I do that, would this work? The best for me would that no one looked or checked my meds, but as I said since I'm from Mexico and I'll travel to a Muslim country and Israel, I really don't know if this would work, on the other hand, Tramadol and Lyrica have low abuse-potential and aren't scheduled everywhere (in Mexico they aren't, they're sold over-the-counter); since I'm not smuggling anything illegaly (I'm not going to insert them in my anus) I guess I just want to know what would be the odds of them checking what I carry in my pockets or my luggage and which would be a better option. Any input or thoughts would be really appreciated, because I'm really really worried about all this.

Thanks in advance and have an excellent day!"

339,Son concerned about his father’s constitutional rights.,"This might be pretty lengthy. 

TL;DR My father is being held in Parker County Jail in Texas, USA for possession of less than a gram of marijuana. He’s been there for over a year and I’m strongly considering suing Parker County for violating my dad’s 8th amendment rights.

I’m not really well versed in law, to be completely honest. I know most of the Constitutional rights including the Bill of Rights, such as amendments I, II, IV, etc,. My dad was a heavy equipment operator for a company that worked in both Missouri and Texas. As I’m sure most people know, Missouri recently fully legalized marijuana for recreational use. Before that, it was legalized for medical usage. My father had a medical card and regularly smoked marijuana to help with nerve damage, arthritis, and anxiety. He brought some with him to Texas when he went for a job down near Arlington, TX. His nerve damage had been really bad so he took some with him. He was caught speeding and told the cops he had marijuana on him, which they promptly detained and arrested him and took him to Parker County Jail. After many attempts to get parole, a proper lawyer, and a legitimate court date, he still is in the jail and has been since January 2022. This is cruel. He has 4 children in total. 2 boys and 2 girls. His daughter and son whom are under the age of an elementary student, barely remember anything about him. I want to know if it would be worth it to pursue a case against the county or the state for holding him for so long for a simple small amount of marijuana, in which most other states he would’ve been written a ticket for.

Any help is appreciated. I miss my dad very much.

EDIT: I did leave some small details out.
He was only going 10 over the speed limit.
We have hired 3 different lawyers all of which overcharge us and do nothing for him. 
One of the lawyers we spoke to said he would’ve been released by now if he was arrested in any other county besides Parker. That’s what the lawyer told me and I have no other evidence but that, admittedly.
He was only charged with possession. There was no DWI charge."

343,"Being screwed because of an ""AS-IS"" policy at a Pawn Shop","I'm in South Carolina

Alright, so 40 hours ago I purchased a Macbook and 2 Calculators from a small family run pawn shop.  I really went in there for the Calculators, but the laptop was right on the counter and was a pretty good deal so I picked it up as well.

The laptop wasn't plugged in, so I asked the person at the counter about it, and he said that it works perfectly.  The only reason they are selling it for so cheap is because they've had it for a while.

I brought it home and powered it on - the laptop's battery was broken and didn't hold a charge at all.  I thought it was no big deal, and I'll just bring it back to them the next day.

So I walked in, and *kindly* asked the lady if I could exchange or return the laptop because it was broken.  She said they had a no return policy, and all of their items are sold as is.  I told her that the person working the counter said the laptop worked great, and that I would not have purchased the laptop if I knew that the laptop was not working.  She mentioned that she *knew* the laptop battery was not working properly - but they still sold it because it was still ""Working great"".  We had an argument on the definition of ""broken"", and how the laptop technically wasn't broken because it still worked fine when plugged in.  I told her that her employee assured me it was working, and how her employee misled me into purchasing the computer.

Her husband than came from the back room and began arguing with me over the ""As-is"" policy, and how I shouldn't have purchased a used computer if I wanted to use it off the charger.  He said that laptop's batteries die after a couple years, and how it was stupid for me to think that this Macbook's battery should have worked.  He said whenever you buy a used laptop the battery will not work, and you have the factor the cost of a battery into the price (WTF).  

The old lady at the counter then asked me how old I was - I said 16, and she said ""You would understand what we're saying if you were older"".  I immediately left the store - almost in tears because I couldn't believe what just happened.

I came back about an hour later with my dad - as you can expect the husband was *much* more respectful when my Dad came in.  He said he could do a store credit towards anything in the store.  I refused, and my dad said he thought a refund would be the only fair thing.  The guy disagreed, and said he would talk to his employee and call my dad with a resolution.

Well my dad got a call from the Pawn Shop an hour or so ago, and they basically said Store Credit is the only option.  The person on the phone acknowledged that the employee said the laptop worked, but they have an As-Is policy so it doesn't matter.  They also said I was no longer allowed on their property, and the only way to receive/spend the store credit is to have an adult use it for me.  

What are my options?  Would a credit card chargeback be possible in a situation like this?  How would I return the laptop to them?  Can I get in trouble for posting multiple reviews to Google/Yelp or writing about them on social media?  Are they honestly allowed to sell multiple laptops with broken batteries without telling people or accepting returns?

I also want to add that I wasn't rude/threatening or anything to the people in the store.  I work in CS and would never be rude to any retail worker.  I was frustrated more than anything - but was not rude in any sense to the workers in the store.  I don't understand why I wouldn't be allowed in the store - especially to spend store credit that they are giving me.

346,Massachusetts: Guide me through legal custody and paternity rights. Im 17 and know nothing about the law.,"So yeah got this girl pregnant. She's 26 weeks along. Apparently her parents support her. They're mad but they recognize theres nothing they can do and are deciding to support and help her through. Same with my parents, told them like an hour ago. 

So I want to make this as easy as possible, preferably without an attorney.

She is not going to college and will probably stay home to take care of the kid. Shes enrolled in a college but well, she'll probably have to cancel.

Im still enrolled and 100% plan on going.

So this is what I want to do.

1) Get a paternity test (just in case).
2) I want to be able to visit in the weekends and on break until I graduate. Im also willing to pay child support. Then after graduation maybe I can work up to more custody. 

So how does my plan sound? I think I should be fine with support payments. Not sure if I can get the visitation rights like that. My ex and I are not on good terms but I think shell be cool with it. Shes pretty nice. 

Also will the courts give me some insane amount of child support? Ill probably be working a minimum wage job for a while. My parents do have money but I dont think that will factor in for CS payments.

Second, how can I legally establish paternity? Law might be rough since were unmarried.

Anything else I need to know? Courts cant force me to drop out of college right? I know its a dick move going and having her do most of the work but Im thinking about long term benefits. Getting a good degree and a good job will be far better in the long run and Ill try to visit every weekend.

**EDIT**

Wow. Okay. Let me clear some assumptions here. 

* Im not forcing her to quit college. She can go if she wants but I dont believe she will. I think she will at least take a year off. 
* She's not in this alone. For fucks sake, you guys think Im dumping her to be some single mom living at the poverty line waiting for welfare checks to survive? Fuck off with that bullshit. Unlike most teen parents, our parents arent kicking us to the curb and said they will support us both in every way. She'll have support from her parents and mine. For fuck sake, she has the money to buy a full time nanny. If she wants to go to college, NOTHING is stopping her. 
* Im not just going to be paying child support. If she needs more money, I'll be more than happy to dip into my savings/college fund for her. Not to mention, my parents will probably help me along with costs and child rearing too. We're not in this alone, alright? 
* Now I know what your going to say, YOUR PARENTS ARE RICH BRO!!! JUST LIVE OFF OF THEM BRO!! Yeah, I already have. For 18 years. Hell Ill probably rely on them for at least the next 5 years. I dont want to do that. I want to be able to get my own solid career, make my own solid money, and be able to support my daughter without relying on my family's wealth. Is that respectable? 
* Im not going to immediately go for 50/50 custody when I graduate. I know thats not realistic. I said I will work up to more custody once I graduate. Thats reasonable right? 
* Yeah I know the first four years of a kids life are tough. I know it will be difficult for her but that's how life is. I'm not forcing her to do anything she doesnt want to do. SHE wanted to keep this baby and she wants to support it, even if means putting college on hold. She could hire a full time nanny if she wanted, but she's not and it isnt because I'm forcing her to be my domestic slave. It's because its what she wants. Ill be there to support her. She's a million times better than me and I really will do my best to repay her kindness in the future. 
* Lastly, sorry for not being the embodiment of Jesus Christ everyone was expecting me to be. Ill clear that up. Im not Jesus. I'm just a teenager from a sheltered life trying to make things better for all parties.

**Okay. I thought some stuff through. I guess I can take a gap year or two until things are better and I can get more time like that. Then I can apply to some in state universities. There's a lot of good ones here too.**

347,Mom got $500k for child support and is going to keep it for herself [TX],"Growing up, I lived with my mom and only got to see my dad every other weekend. My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn’t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.

My dad’s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.

My mom wasn’t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.

Now my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would’ve been for me if I were under 18. Do I have legal recourse and can I expect to redeem some percentage of this payout?"

349,I have a gun that I don't want. How do I legally and safely get rid of it?,"I'm in Indiana. When I bought my house in 2010, my dad gave me a gun as a ""housewarming gift"". And I mean, like, he literally handed me a handgun and a clip full of bullets. I've been to a gun range like, once in my life over 20 years ago. I don't know anything about using guns. I don't even know if this thing is loaded. I just set it on a super high shelf in an unused closet and have ignored it since. (Don't worry, I have literally never had any children in my house and never plan to, I live alone and have social anxiety so I rarely even have visitors.)

If I try to give it back to my dad, he'll probably get upset and just want to teach me to use it instead, because he freaking loves guns. I don't want to learn how to use it, I don't even like touching it. I hate guns. Even if it would be legal to sell it or give it away, I really don't want to put another gun in redneck circulation. 

Would the police take it for me if I called ahead and said I'm bringing them an unwanted gun? Would it get my dad in trouble if the gun is in his name? If I can just quietly give it away to the police, I can just keep pretending to still have it, dad's happy, I'm happy, and the gun is off doing whatever police do with unwanted guns."

354,Lost job offer due to religious beliefs,"Ok so I had my interview on Wednesday. The job was through a third party recruiter and about half hour after the interview, the recruiter called me and told me that the company loved me and are offing me the job at an EXTREMELY nice salary. Much more than the industry standard. 

Now the tricky part was I did not expect it to go so quickly and was going to wait for the second round before talking about my Jewish restrictions. Since there was no second round, I had to tell the recruiter that I accept but would need to leave early on fridays for sabbath and that I will use vacation days for any religious holidays that I will be observing. He passed the message along 

I got a call back from the recruiter that the president of the company (the person who interviewed me) would like to talk to me about it. So we spoke on the phone, he sounded nice and cordial and said that it “should be fine”. 

I was supposed to receive the offer letter yesterday and now on Friday I have heard nothing from them. Additionally, they are in a huge rush to fill this position so the fact that they are suddenly slow has me concerned. If I do not get the job I will 100% know it is due to religion. Do I have any grounds to sue them?

Fact that might change things: the owner of the company is also a religious Jew. Much more religious than I am 

Also I’m on my phone so if none of this makes sense please ask me for clarification. Thanks!"
355,I Was Fired for Pulling a Taser on an Aggressive Banned Customer,"I live in Ohio. I don't know if this is considered unlawful firing or not? Some of my friends say I should go after the company, but I'm not sure. 

&#x200B;

I've worked for this company with no issues from 2015-2017 before I filed a two weeks' notice. My friend (now assistant manager) asked me to reapply because things were getting rough and I've been working for them again since July 09, 2020. They fired me July 27, 2020. It's an adult store with only 48 stores around the country.

&#x200B;

On July 26, 2020 at 1:55PM, I (Black, female, 24) came into work at the adult store. My coworker (White, female, 20s) informed me that a banned customer (Black, male, 50s) was inside the store. I told the man to leave. He said I was mistaken and said he had talked to our corporate office. I told him again to leave, and he got verbally aggressive and approached the counter. I told him again to leave or else I would tase him. He got angry and ran up to confront me. He pinned me against the wall before I could tase him. He exclaimed, “Stop it, stop it,” but I placed my nails into his arm that held my taser back. He backed away and complained that I had broken his necklace and hurled insults at me, but he left after I ridiculed him and he attempted to displace our outdoor trashcan. At some point my coworker had called our manager (Black, male, 50s) and we told him what was happening over the phone. I proceeded to clock in for my shift which had started at 2PM; it was approximately 2:15PM now. The man returned several minutes later with *a machete* and demanded I return his glasses, which I had knocked off his face earlier. I threw his glasses over the counter and mocked him again. Several customers were in the store. My coworker called the police. The man told me, ""Next time, bitch,"" and left again. My coworker called my manager again and *told* him to come in. 

&#x200B;

The police arrived within ten minutes, and my coworker and I recounted the events. We both said that we wanted to press charges against the man. 

&#x200B;

My manager arrived around 3:30PM-4PM. My coworker's shift ended at 3PM, but she didn't feel comfortable leaving me. She left once our manager arrived. He emailed the other stores a note I'd written recounting the details. My assistant manager (White, female, 30) came in at 5PM, not knowing what had happened. We told her. Our manager left. I told my assistant manager to inform our other coworker (White, female, 20s) so she wouldn't be in the dark, either. Around 7PM, our regional manager (White, male, late 30s-early 40s) called to ask me to explain what had happened. I told him that I had not immediately called the police as both myself and the assailant are Black, and there is currently a civil rights movement going on about police brutality against Black people. My shift ended at 9PM and I left an extra taser and pepper spray with my assistant manager. 

&#x200B;

On July 27, 2020 at 11:33AM, I received a call from my manager who told me that HR wanted me terminated because I had a taser. I texted my assistant manager and two coworkers to tell them I had been fired over the debacle and that it had been nice working with them."

We're all young (mid 20's) and my gut instinct tells me this is probably illegal somehow, but I just need it confirmed so I can get this idea out of my head and just move on.

It's his official representative page not his personal page.  I was blocked because my comments were ""harassment and not sincere questions or honest debate"".  Which is a bunch of baloney because a lot of my posts where links to articles or reports disputing information on his page, any questions I did ask were left unanswered while other responses were commented on by the page.  All of which were deleted.

  
I had contacted the MN ACLU 7 weeks ago as of today and haven't heard back.  Their confirmation stated: "" It typically takes us 4 - 6 weeks to process complaints.  If the ACLU of Minnesota is able to offer you assistance, we will contact you to  gather more information. \*\*If we are unable to assist you, you will not  hear from us at all.\*\*""

So I'm guessing they WON'T be assisting me.

I messaged my representative's page asking, ""When will I will be able to post again?""  I never got a response and as of the time of the post I'm still blocked from commenting on anything posted on his page.  I've seen articles online that it's illegal to do this.   But there's no way I'd be able to afford an attorney at this time to help me, which is why I tried to contact the ACLU.  Is there any way I can legally get them to unblock me on my own, or find someone to help?  Thanks."
359,Job recruiter wasn't up front about drug screening until after I resigned from current job,"I've been in talks with a recruiter for the past couple of months regarding a job in another state. At one point during our discussions, the recruiter said there was going to be a background check. I asked them specifically what that entailed, and they said, ""oh you know, just standard background check, work history, criminal records, etc.""

So I decided to interview for the job. I passed the interview, was offered a job, and accepted it. After the timing of my start date was discussed, I submitted my two week resignation to my employer. That very same day, I began receiving emails from the background checking site the recruiting company uses. I filled out all the info and submitted it. Later that day, another email came in indicating there was another document to fill out. This one was a drug screening. Suddenly, I was nervous. I had just returned from a trip to a state where marijuana is recreationally legal, and I had consumed a lot. I knew there was no way I would pass the test. So, I called the recruiter and told them my situation. They stated that this had been an issue in the past, but since the job was in Colorado and it shouldn't be a problem. I told them they never mentioned to me that there would be a drug test and they apologized that they forgot to tell me. Thirty minutes later, the recruiter called me back with their supervisor on the phone. They started out by congratulating me on the new job and said they understood that I thought I wouldn't pass the test. They said, ""no problem, we will just delay taking the test for a couple of weeks to help you clear your system. If you get emails from HR, don't respond. We'll take care of it"" This seemed really shady to me. Then after the call, I received this text message from the recruiter:  


>""Hi - I've run into this issue a number of times being in Colorado where there's a struggle between state and federal laws. I know a number of people who have used products that allow them to pass drug screenings. This is not my professional advice, but I'm sharing this link from a few friends' personal experience going through this so that you have another option other than waiting a few weeks, if preferred.""

When I realized the link was to a site advertising fake penises and fake urine, I thought that this constituted fraud. I was not going to do such a thing. If anything, I would rather wait and clear my system naturally.

Well, it's been two weeks and tomorrow I have to take the drug screening before flying to Denver on Sunday. Just tonight, I took an at home drug test and it showed positive for THC, so I am pretty certain tomorrow's actual test will show the same.

If I don't get the job because of this recruiter's neglect for telling me these details up front, is there anything I can do legally? At the very least, if I do fail and don't get the job, I plan to send these texts from them to their HR representatives.

Had the recruiter told me at the beginning of our discussions a couple months ago, I would have not made the choices I did while in a state where marijuana is legal. Now I feel stuck. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
360,(USA) My daughter was molested at school,"My 5 year old daughter was molested by another 5 year old at her private school. The teacher was outside the classroom when this occurred so there are no adult witnesses. However when we brought it in they made a big show they were handling it (including sending out an email tot he parents and calling meetings with the social worker and children). But things degrade from that point. They led my daughter to say he didn't touch her inside her leggings (which she said multiple times before that meeting that he did). Also they evidently told all the parents who was involved and alienated us from the entire class and most of the school. On top of that they decided the touching was not overtly inappropriate and said they would give open passes to allow my daughter to talk to the social worker whenever she needs. Also the social worker was to take the students on lunch dates to foster friendships and work past this. 

However this is what has happened(within over a month) more bullying from the class. The parents of the children(there was another girl also molested) involved have alienated us. The teacher has also been dismissive and nasty to my daughter.I don't want to sue but I want to know what I can do, I'm already looking into other schools. But I am afraid this kind of thing will happen to other children and it is really just wrong. 

Side notes:The parents of the other victim and the molester, the teacher and the social worker are all friends from high school."
361,Parent's just closed selling their house. The owners of the house they were supposed to purchase in 2 weeks are apparently trying to declare bankruptcy.,"Connecticut USA.  

My parents have a contract to purchase a house form a couple they have since learned are underwater on their mortgage.  They believe to the tune of $100k.  The owner's bank has approved the sale despite this though we have been led to believe that at least some of the debt has not been forgiven.  They used to own a fairly prominent local business that failed about 15 years ago due to technological obsolescence.  We know that they had obtained a rental house\(despite a low credit score, local friends and business owners had vouched for them\) with the lease starting April 1 but have not moved in.\(as of May 2\)

My parents just closed on their old house yesterday.  They have arranged to rent the house for 2 weeks from the new owner until they close on their new house\(May 15\).   They had at one time atempted to arrange a simultaneous closing but were unable to get everyone's schedule to work.  They are mostly packed and ready to move by now.  They have already scheduled movers and painter to work on the house the week after closing.  They have working with architects on come sonsiderable renovations.

Yesterday my parent's real estate lawyer got a call from the lawyer of the owners of the house they are pruchasing saying that he thinks the owners are trying to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy.  This lawyer is a real estate lawyer and is not involved in the bankruptcy case. My parents lawyer suspects that they want to strenghten thier bankruptcy case by showing the underwater loan. This doesn't make much sense to me because a $100k debt on a house you no longer own or live in looks just as bad to me.  The only thing I can think of is that these people have accepted bankruptcy and now want to delay the sale so they can stay in their house at least as long as the proceedings which should last the summer\(i understand 90 days is normal to expect.\)  My parents will be homeless in two weeks while this couple\(who understandably are in hard times\) has essentially fucked them.  My parents are fairly well off and are not in danger of sleeping on the street, but this situation will be extremely stressful for them emotionally and will certainly cost them significant money to mitigate.  It could take many months for them to find a suitable house.

My parents are attemtping to meet with a local bankruptcy lawyer tomorrow to try to better understand what could possibly happen.  They tend to deal in hyperbole and I like to be the voice of reason so I'm looking for advice here to help them keep a relatively cool head.  They also are so emotionally devastated that they are questioning the desire to even buy this house \(potentially after considerable delay\)  This is a silly sentiment to me as they loved the house and have made a lot of plans for renovations compounded with the fact that there are no other houses on the market they are currently interested in.  Even if they found one, a 90 day closing is not unheard of due to seller needs."

To this end they have sent away groceries, received and then returned an important letter sent via UPS, intercepted said letter on a followup attempt and tried to physically keep it from me (before attempting to lock me out of the building after I finally took receipt of the thing), and have lied to me when I've inquired about deliveries. 

I mentioned missing mail and that my mailbox had been accessed at least twice. The first indication someone other than my mailman and I were inside of my mailbox was a poorly written correspondence to my carrier to not deliver anything to Susan. This was signed illegibly and placed in my mailbox, presumably by my landlord as he is the only other person with keys.  The other incident was the little name tag inside the box had been replaced with one lacking Susan's name.

This has been incredibly galling and an initial report made to the Post Office came to a disappointing conclusion.  Ten days after making my complaint I received an email  which failed to address any of my concerns but nonetheless declared my issue to be resolved and assured me mail delivery would return to normal. I called to reopen the issue with them, indicating that perhaps I had not conveyed the problem clearly because the email seemed a bit confused and the problems had  in fact grown worse. The gentleman was receptive and they have reopened this complaint. Nonetheless I am concerned that nothing will be accomplished, I have had unsatisfying experiences appealing to the various authorities in life; from the police, to the City of Seattle, to the United States Post Office, it never seems to me that I am getting a fair shake. I don't know how to best advocate for myself here but I feel I am being harassed by my landlord and that his behavior at best exists on the fringes of legality and at worst is completely illegal. I have no money whatsoever, although I may be able to secure assistance from a family friend in affording a  lawyer.  My questions then: Regardless of any potential criminal charges (I'm not holding my breath) what are my chances of holding my landlord accountable in civil court? How would I go about finding an attorney to discuss this possibility with? Would such a consultation cost me money up front? Cure me of my naivety. Thank you and my apologies for this messy ramble ."
363,Advise needed about monitoring someone's compter,"I am in the D/FW area of N TX

I need legal advise concerning something I am wanting to do.

Here is the situation...

I have a roommate who can't afford to pay for his own internet account. I am paying for a mid-range level package through Time Warner (now Spectrum). The problem with my roommate is that he has no filters what-so-ever when he is online, he clicks on all hyperlinks he comes across whether they are in emails,. chats, etc, clicks on pop-ups, clicks on shady computer ads, visits many porn, conspiracy theory and religious website that catches his interest (as those site groups are notorious for spreading all kinds of virus', malware, spyware, etc). I have repeatedly told him what he needs to do in order to keep his PC as clean as possible, only to have my lessons go in one ear, bounce around his brain a few times and fly out the other ear faster than the words went in.

Due to his lack of online intelligence, I have, after repeatedly fixing problems on his current PC and after destroying 5 other PCs and one laptop, turned on parental controls on his PC which do no work (even though he complains that what he is trying to do requires admin permissions (which I don't give unless he can explain to me why he needs a new program or new software installed)). I want to download and install a few good Net Nanny programs on his comp to monitor and track what he does online. The last time I was on his PC was 2 months ago to install the most current windows updates. When I install updates, I do go over his installed programs and scanning kits to make sure that they are up to date, clean out all but the most current restore points and to see how much free space is on his HDD (at that time he had 215Gb of free space). Today as I was heading to work, he called me to his room to see why his computer was running slow, after a quick check, I found that he has less than 1.5Gb for space left on his PC. I told him that I can't even work on his computer until Wednesday at the earliest and before I begin to work on his system, I needed a list of every site he has visited (he has no idea what browser history is).

Honestly I am afraid to get on his computer as I may see things I don't want to see. I did inform him that if I can, I am going to install software on his PC that will let me know on a regular basis what sites he has been to, links he has clicked or tried to click and what he tried to download and install. 

Right there is where I am needing advise on. I am paying for access to the net for both of us and I am wanting to know if I can install monitoring software on his PC to cover my tail to make sure that he isn't doing anything bordering on or is illegal. I have tried googling this and have found one case where a homeowner in Wisconsin was convicted of receiving and transmitting CP on their unsecured Wi-Fi network.

I have also informed my roommate that once I fix his PC, I will no longer help him in the future as he can not, will not listen and accept any and all advice and lessons about safe internet browsing.

As an F.Y.I., 7 years ago, I kept his hide out of jail for credit card and mail fraud after UPs, Fed-Ex and the USPS dropped numerous packages on the front porch of our former home (at least 8 55"" LCD TVs, clothes, random electronics and various other goods) as I was doing homework for one of my ISS classes. After I talked him into letting me and copy see his IM logs and emails concerning what he received and will be receiving, taking photo images of what was delivered and stopped off at the police to report what I thought he was getting into against the law on my way to class. 

TLDR: The police was notified about the roommates activities, they came by while I was at school after reporting my suspicions talked to the roommate and confiscated all packages as it was determined that he was roped into taking part in credit and mail fraud.

In the initial 5.5 years since, he has been behaving himself online and not doing anything stupid (save for destroying many computers). In the past 1.5 years he has destroyed 1 laptop and two PCs by doing things online that he shouldn't be doing. His last PC is in storage with 3 others that were similarly destroyed by him installing numerous cloud servers, computer maintenance programs, etc.

Any help that will lead me in the right direction would and will be greatly appreciated."
364,I can't bail out my friend because ICE has a hold on her case.,"My friend got detained for her friend being pulled over and she was in the car. Upon searching the vehicle they found her THC cartridge, and arrested her at that time. She has a felony charge pending against her at this time. We attempted to go to the bail bondsman and tried to help bail her out, but they said we couldn't because ICE has a hold of her case (she's a DACA Recipient). Any advice as to how long they can detain her or if we can get a hearing on monday in order for the judge to grant bail. Any resources that can be passed will help. This is my best friend, and she doesn't deserve to be deported for being a regular 23 year old. Please help we're in San Antonio, Texas. "
365,Another trial for my divorce??? [MA],"My ex is crazy.  We had a full divorce trial last year and she has since filed for an appeal and then stayed the appeal so she could file for modifications.  

Now we have another pre-trial coming up and I am suppose to write up another memorandum.  I feel like I am going through this all over again.  How is she allowed to do this? 

I want to move on with my life.  

I don't see how our legal system can work like this.  Going through the same divorce twice?

Can I get her lawyer thrown off the case?  She knew she didn't serve me properly and also ignored my email asking if we had any upcoming hearings.  

Suggestions welcome (aside from just saying I need a lawyer).  I basically did this myself the first time around.

Thanks."
366,[WA] My boyfriend is wealthy and I'm pregnant. He wants nothing more to do with me. What legal recourse do I have?,"He's willing to pay child support, but he wants to pay only child support for the next 18 years. I don't have a lot of money and don't want to bring a child into the world on such limited means. He's staunchly anti-abortion, but if I don't get any further backing from him I plan to pursue one. I want to know how to make my position clear without making this seem like a threat, even though it kind of is one. Can I get in trouble legally for this, even though all I want to do is guarantee the best possible future for me and my child? I don't really have the money for a lawyer but will probably end up splurging. I want to get a good idea what to expect first so I don't waste everybody's time."
367,Does a crime stop being investigated if the victim dies?,"First off, I'm asking for a friend (I'm not just saying that, there is proof that I haven't even been to California before 2018). 

The crime happened in California in 2010. About 10 years later the victim was killed in a traffic accident.

The crime he got accused of is burglary and now the alleged victim has died."
368,I need advice. Stole something at walmart worth about $25 but was stupid enough to buy something on my credit afterwards. Ontario,"I stole 2 electronics cables worth maybe just over $20 total that I needed but didn't want to pay for at the time. Took them out of their packaging and just put it in my pocket, leaving the packaging on random racks. Unfortunately I panicked and grabbed some pencils to buy, worth about 3$, which I paid for on my credit card. I heard walmart takes this stuff pretty seriously and I sure didn't make it hard for them to find me. Are they going to pursue this and if so what would I expect? Just a letter of warning or something? Should I go in and talk to the manager and try to pay for it now, about 4 days later or would that just make it worse? I'm 19 and in Ontario. No previous record or stealing at walmart."
369,Should/can I sue the IRS at this point? Still waiting on my 2019 return and 2021 stimulus payements.,"Been trying to handle my 2019 refund since November when I got an ID verify notice (at my old address, which they have still not updated). After calling almost everyday for over 2 months I finally got through to someone, who said it should be no more than 9 weeks until I get my refund (but that it will probably only be 2 or 3). Well, it has been around 11 weeks and nothing has shown up.

Anyways, after getting a credit card I was finally able to open an online account today (because they would not verify me with a debit card \*rolls eyes\*), my 2019 transcript says I did not file.

Turbotax can verify I filed, and the IRS sent me a notice after receiving my return. So the IRS should have no reason to act like they did not get my return.

What is my recourse?

Should I sue just to get the wheels moving? (this would be pro se, as my refund is less than attorney's fees would be and I don't qualify for the local clinic at SMU since I am not a respondent). This whole process is a drag to the point where I feel like a subpoena is the only way I can get them to do anything. I don't want to actually go to court, but they will not answer the phone and have no other way to contact them.

In addition, their online portal states I am not owed a stimulus payment based on my income I should be owed the full $2,000.

Note: I had to take out a loan as I had planned on using the projected income from my return to pay for a deposit. So I am accruing interest every day the IRS does not send me my money.

Edit: It has been 6 months since I originally filed (late July after an extension), I just figured COVID was making things go a little slow till I got the ID verification notice. From what I can tell from reading about tax court, 6 months seems to be the point at which I can sue.

370,My girlfriend who I was breaking up with turns out to be pregnant. What are my options?,"I've been dating this girl for a year now. She currently does not work, does not have a car, and has no money. I own a house, a car, and a decent job. She is currently living with me on lease agreement that she has never once fulfilled. I am currently the provider for both of us. She is the holder of every red flag and I honestly should have seen it coming, but I was dumb.

Well, about 3 months or so ago we sort of broke up. We are not fit and I'm tired of paying for everything and dropping everything to give her rides. I gave her a lease termination and told her she had 30 days to leave. Well, fast forward 30ish days she never left. I was prepared to go to court but as you guessed by the title, she's pregnant. I'm not sure if it's mine but I'm going to assume so by her word.

She's obviously not fit to be a mom. She has countless mental issues and needs to be on medication. She smokes weed like there's no tomorrow and I honestly feel like that's where my child support would go if it came to that. She relies on everyone else to do things for her and can barely take care of herself. She's currently smoking cigarettes still, but is trying to quit (she's been trying to quit for the past 6 months but has a mental breakdown each and every time she stops to the point where she becomes suicidal).

Once she's out of my house, she would be forced to move in with her mom, who is an ex-drug addict and just as bad as her. If this is my child, I wouldn't want her to be raised in that kind of enviroment.

As of right now, I would feel like a dick making her leave if it is my child, so she's still living here. We are still ""together"" just so that she doesn't freak out and do something stupid. However, I'm not living the rest of my life like this. If this is my child, what are my options? Is it possible for a father to gain full custody? How soon can this be done?

I live in Wisconsin."
371,Any truth to Admiralty Maritime Law or sovereign citizen status?,"United States, FL:



I would like to start off by saying I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CRAP.

But is there any validity to these arguments whatsoever?

I am aware that some groups are granted a special sovereign status in the U.S. like Native American reservations or perhaps the Amish?

Is there a sovereign status granted for individuals? (Does that change legal responsibility in any way?)


Or even more far off, do you have to be a citizen of any country at all?

I just want the truth not some off the wall YouTube law.

Even if it is all BS. Has it ever worked?"
372,Legal defense of bicycle,"I have recently bought a new bicycle and decked it out pretty heavily. I am looking to use it to explore my city. Unfortunately, living in Chicago there are riskier areas scattered throughout that can be difficult to avoid and I know having such a nice bike is likely to make me a target, even if I am currently riding it. How can I legally defend my property in the incident that someone is to attempt a theft? I'm not interested in any sort of firearms, but to what extent can I booby trap or even detonate my bicycle were it ripped directly from me and taken away as I watched?"
373,"I can prove without any doubt that my Bank has lied to me 20+ times over major events in the past few months. Their blatant lies have destroyed me financially, what options do I have (OH)","Hi Guys,

So I have multiple checking/savings as well as a credit card with a bank, lets call them FUBank.  FUBank recently got a major reward for being the ""most honest bank of the year"", however I have been lied to, slandered, and overall just bent over and fucked with a sandpaper condom by them.

Ive been with them just shy of a year, and in that time their lies have been like miniature nuclear bombs on my credit and finances.  I am able to prove a massive chain of lies and deception by their customer service, dispute, and customer advocate departments.  These lies were told over the phone, on recorded lines, and I would have no issue showing how these lies have cost me not only money but how they have negatively impacted my emotionally.

In addition to continuously lying to me I have been called a Liar by their company, right after proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was correct.  In this particular case a dispute agent claimed to call me and leave a voicemail before closing a dispute.  After explaining I never received it I was called a Liar, I then had my phone carrier print the phone records and low and behold, they never called.  I then sent them proof they never called and was called a liar again.  That one cost me a few hundred.

So I am at the point I want to retain a lawyer and subpoena the recorded calls, all correspondance, etc so that I can build a case. My questions are:

1) Should I be looking at lawyers locally or near their corporate headquarters?

2) Would I be wasting my time sending a letter to their legal department laying out my accusations and intent to try and settle this before getting a lawyer

3) How many legal hours would get tied up in this?  There is probably around 15-25hrs of audio to go through

Thanks as always!"
374,Public school student coerced into signing a document supporting a political organization,"My daughter is a high school student in Pennsylvania.  Yesterday one of her teachers presented her class with a document that is a pledge to support Black Lives Matter.  Not just in principle, but the wording of the document includes a pledge to physically participate in BLM activities.  According to my daughter, signing it was nominally optional, but the unambiguous spoken message was that anyone unwilling to sign it was racist.

Based on comments on a school parents' Facebook group, this is was not just one teacher's action. Parents of children in different classes and different grade levels are saying their children were asked to sign it too.  I don't yet know if the school's administration is behind it not, or if they are even aware of it.

To me this coerced political activity is *highly* inappropriate.  Some parents are going as far as claiming that it is illegal.  Is it?"
375,I made a huge mistake and went to an massage parlor for a happy ending.,"In a moment of great foolishness and weakness this afternoon I went to a sketchy massage parlor and got a happy ending massage. I am greatly ashamed and upset wth myself. I plan on telling my wife and working through the emotional/relational consequences there. My question here is this: how likely is it that this will come back to me legally? I went a little after lunchtime, parked in the rear parking lot out of view from the street. I did see a camera at the entry door, but none inside. There was only one woman there, that I saw. I never explicitly asked for the happy ending, it just sort of happened (although I certainly went there with that thought in mind-not trying to absolve myself here). I was there for probably 20 minutes, left in a rush of shame and embarrassment and got in my car and left. I paid with cash that was recently withdrawn from the bank. Of course my mind is coming up with all sorts of  paranoid possibilities where I could get caught after the fact. Is that possible? Is it likely? Should I be nervous about the police showing up at home or at work? I live in Texas. Just trying to prepare myself for all possible consequences. Thanks. "
376,Teacher told by administration to quit using gender neutral prefix,"My wife is a teacher at a public elementary school in the state of Georgia in the USA. She has, since beginning the job earlier this year, utilized the prefix Mx. on all documentation, communication, and public facing media regarding her position and responsibilities.  She does this as she is non-binary.

This morning, she was pulled from a class to have an impromptu meeting with the principal, vice principal, and a county HR representative to explain why she used the prefix, then told her to quit using it and to remove all traces of it. They did not say she has to go by Ms. or Mrs. but that if she didn’t want to use them, to use first initial and last name (J. Doe) instead.

Does this constitute gender discrimination? Should a conversation be had with the BOE or legal counsel?

She feels incredibly wronged by the entire situation. She is going to lay low about it in the mean time and contact her union representative."
377,[MA] friends messed with teacher's coffee cup,"So basically the other day when my drama teacher was out of the room talking to someone a couple of my friends thought it would be funny to rub our dicks/balls on the rim of her coffee thing that she left on the piano. She didn't drink from it when she came back in but there was definitely coffee in it so she might have later.

Today one of my friends texted me that someone found out about our prank and told the teacher. Our class didn't meet today so I didnt see the teacher so I don't know, and I won't see her until after the long weekend.

If this is true and the teacher found out, how bad of trouble could we be in? We're freshmen in high school (14/15 yo). One of us got an MIP once but we're usually good kids and good students.

Thanks"
378,Bipolar workplace discrimination,I have been an adjunct professor for 14 years. I was the first adjunct to win professor of the year. I have meets and exceeds on all of my reviews. Students and faculty typically like me. I am also bipolar and have crippling anxiety. I have had a problem with checking email. I get real anxiety when checking emails to the point that I can’t do it. This is really embarrassing for me. I rarely get an email directed towards me. But I have not responded in a timely manner to some. This is getting worse. This is causing problems. I have tried to explain to my chair and dean to no avail. I have requested a reasonable accommodation to be called if I can’t be reached by email. This request has not been honored. The problem is getting worse as a result. I have been put on unpaid status. I don’t know what to do.
379,[NH] Can I be liable for child support in a foreign country (France)?,"Last year, I spent the summer abroad in France. I ended meeting a girl there and long story short she ended up getting pregnant. I absolutely had no interest in raising a child, as I am just a college student so I told her that I wasn't going to be supporting her and her child and advised her to get an abortion.

I've since returned back to the states. I've decided that I've had a ""financial abortion"", which I feel absolves me from responsibility here.

Despite my advice, she went ahead and had her child anyways. Recently, she contacted me on facebook and told me that she was having trouble supporting her child and that she was going to be seeing a lawyer to obtain child support from me. I told her that I had already decided that I wasn't going to be involved and she knew that from the start. I then proceeded to block her number, as well as social media accounts.

I thought by retreating from France, I'd be immune from child support payment, but now I'm not quite sure because there isn't much info available online regarding the topic.

Would it be possible for the French government to hold me responsible for child support even though I'm a U.S. citizen?


"
380,[TX] Conservative employer has created a hostile work environment for me because I'm liberal. Anything I can do?,"My boss owns his company and I work for him. Our work spaces are close by and he leaves his office door open and listens to the radio while he works and he keeps the volume turned up pretty loud. He doesn't listen to music, he listens to talk radio and podcasts. All day, every day. It's Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ben Shapiro, and a few others. It's annoying.

So I asked my boss a few weeks ago if he would mind closing his door or turning down the volume and he laughed and said ""hell no, I keep it turned up so you can hear it hoping one day you'll smell the roses."" He's always saying things like that because he knows I supported Bernie, then Hillary. He says that he doesn't blame me for being a liberal at 25, but if I'm still one at 35 it means I've got ""kangaroo dung for brains.""

I don't have an office, my desk is in the front of his office, so I don't have a door I can close. Well I decided to listen to my own podcasts on my computer. So the other day I was listening to Rachel Maddow and my boss came out of his office and heard it and told me to turn it off. I was a little shocked at first and he said that I could listen to ""music or other stuff,"" but he didn't want ""that liberal junk"" playing around him. I told him it was my phone and it was a free country and he laughed and said ""you're free to believe the wrong way, but you're not free to express it in my building."" 

So as I sit here on my lunch break I'm being forced to listen to conservative talk radio in the background, as I have been everyday. I am very uncomfortable and feel like he is pressing his political ideology on my against my will. It has actually started causing me to have anxiety. 

What can I do? I know the easy answer is to find another job, but the pay and benefits are far better than anything else in the area. What can I do to eliminate this hostile work environment?"
381,I Got A DUI....,"Hello, So in September I got a DUI and I would love any advice before my upcoming arraignment. I drank at about 10:30PM on the 18th of Sept with a friend before entering a night club. Now the worst part that got me was there had happened to be a perfect parking spot right in front of the club which was very rare ( IT WAS A CURSE IN DISGUISE). When I got out of the club it was about 1:30 AM ( I did NOT drink at all in the club because I'm low-key cheap lol) and I was still a little drunk I could feel it, so I had told one of my other friends which was not drunk let me ride with them until I sober up which he was obliged to do. He went and visited a girl at her house while I slept in his passenger seat while i took a nap and drank a bottle water. Eventually he came back to the car at 4:45am and woke me up to drop me back off at my car, which at the time I told him I felt fine now and no longer drunk since I hadn't drank since 10:30PM Night Before. He dropped me off at my vehicle which was parked again IN FRONT of the night club which was a horrible decision now that I look back on it. I pull out from the club parking lot at 5:00AM and a police officer immediately starts following me. Im fully aware of him as soon as I start driving because he's just riding me instantly, & now I'm making sure I'm going speed limit which was 30MPH according to my GPS home and I also had both hands on the wheel making sure not too swerve while keeping a watchful eye on the cop behind me. He continued to follow me for 5 minutes and at this time I'm not panicking because I feel totally fine in my mind and not drunk.  I continued to drive perfectly fine until he blurped, which I pulled over instantly. He told me he pulled me over for swerving in between lanes which was hilarious because there was no possible way, furthermore he also said my vehicle smelled like alcohol so I complied and did all his tests. I eventually got the breathalyzer portion which I blew a .10 which is .02 over the legal limit (Barley).  I went to jail for the night and since then my life has been hell, Ive been having to pay all these DMV Fees & DUI Class Fees (Which I Enrolled in), my insurance sky rocketed and all this just all happened after I got a $500 Speeding ticket two weeks before this incident. Im young 24 years old I don't have a ton of money I can blow at this time and affording a lawyer and paying 2 - 3k isn't not possible for me. Life has been screwing me lately aside from all these tickets & fees and I already learned my lesson 10 fold and I will never end up in this situation again, do you guys have any advice or helpful opinions? It would be greatly appreciated !"
382,Can a workplace say you can not use the “mothers room” if you are a guy?,"So, we have a room called the “mothers room” at work. There are two or three of these rooms in the building and I work for a large corporation. They are never used really ever. I know because I sit near it and watch the rooms remain unoccupied except when people occasionally use the sink to wash there hands. If a person has used it for breastfeeding, I would be shocked if I missed it, but it is possible obviously.

Well, today I used it for exactly that. I washed my hands. I was in it for no more than 2 minutes. I walked out and some women told me I am not allowed to be in that room. I will save the conversation but she did it twice, with a massive attitude, and I acknowledged what she said without agreeing or disagreeing. Side note, a coworker said many think she is a b#%*#, but that is a side note. She also doesn’t have a kid or breastfeeds, so I wasn’t stopping her from using it for those two minutes (I will save how I know this, but it is known).

Anyways, my question is not a “moral” question about using it, but a legal one. Can a workplace say that a man can NOT use a room designated or “dedicated” to mothers (it appears to be for breastfeeding)? I’m not saying for a man to occupy it for meetings, social time, or other things. I mean to use it for a couple of minutes to use the sink to wash there hands or other things for 2 to 4 minutes max?

Reason I ask is that this seems to be discrimination. I do not see any “fathers room” that is equal or equivalent to this room. Also, since we as a country (USA) just stated that a workplace or business can not tell a person what bathroom they are allowed to use based on appearances or assumptions, what gives them the right to tell me I can not use the room or sink or enter into said room?

To be clear, I am not interested in sitting in the room and preventing someone from using it who needs to breastfeed. I would only be washing my hands in there and drying them mainly. It would take a couple minutes max with the door shut. Maybe 4 minutes at max to even be extremely conservative about the number.

What is my legal rights to using this room? Can a coworker or anyone else tell me I can not use a room due to my gender or sex? Especially if an equivalent room is not provided?

Thanks you for any information on this.

EDIT: To be clear, this is in the state of North Carolina."

Note- This is a small community theater in Wisconsin with less than 100 audience members per performance.

384,Lose prevention guy stole from my purse...,"I know I made a terrible mistake, so please no moral lectures or opinions...
Tried taking a couple items from my local grocery store in Cook County, IL. The loss prevention and/or stock boy caught me and took the items from my purse before I left but also took my Samsung tablet; I panicked in the moment and was willing to take it as a loss so as not get detained and booked it out if there.

So my question is, if they try to trace me from my info in my tablet can I can counteract legally with the fact I never took anything from the store but my property was actually taken by one of their employees on camera? I changed all my passwords on the cloud accounts I recall to be on the tablet but I’m sure that’s not enough"

386,Harassed for Feral Cat Opinion,"I'm in WA, USA.

I recently posted an opinion about feral cats concerning the chick who shot the infamous ""Tiger"". I said it was a good thing to shoot feral cats, as long as they didn't experience pain (the shot was a good one, it's unlikely the animal would have suffered long). I said that given the opportunity I might shoot ferals in the field, and mentioned many people in rural communities do.

The post blew up with around 53 people responding and 8 harassing messages including death threats. Then I got an email from my university concerning a vague ""harassment"". I wasn't sure if they meant me, or if I was harassing (I didn't threaten anyone), so I thought 'I can take care of myself' and deleted it.

I got 2 phone calls a week ago. One from the college I attend, the other from that local police department. I no longer live in that area and am graduating from that college. My phone was dead at the time, and its unlikely I would have responded anyway. 

I'm kind of just ignoring this in the hopes it will go away. I mean, its a dumb facebook post. Yeah I got a little heated but why would that hurt me? Also the messages seemed to have stopped as of the 1st of May. 

I don't know if it will continue. How screwed am I, legally? What can they do to me? What should I do?"
387,Vaping Rights and School Policy,"I am from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida...

So a few days ago I am in school and during 5th period I go to the restroom. In the middle of using the stall, the fire alarm goes off and it startles me. So I stop in thee middle of peeing, zip up my pants, wash and dry my hands, and left the boy's restroom as fast as I could. I go back to my class room, grab my things, and head out through the nearest exit and meet up with my class outside of school.

We stay outside away from the school for about 20 minutes, then we all head back to our classes. As soon as I get to class, we all settle down and we end up not having to do any work because of the convenience of the fire alarm. Since I didn't have any work to complete, i thought that I could use my spare time to take a a nap. 5 minutes into my nap, security comes and pulls me out of class, searches me, then question me about what i did to set the alarm off. After searching me, they look through my book bag. When they look through my bag, they find a small bottle of vape oil in one pocket of my bag, and a vaporizer pen in the other. So now they suspect that I was the one who went into the restroom and vaped since I was the last one to enter and leave the restroom in the same time period that the fire alarm went off.

BUT, here's the thing. My vape pen and vape oil was in my book bag the entire class period. When I went to go use the restroom, I did not have my book bag with me. Therefore it couldn't have been me because I did't have anything on me that could have possibly that the smoke detector could have detected. I means yeah I have a vape but I never used it inside of school. And I never took even took it out of my book bag. So could they still falsely accuse me of vaping in the restroom and setting off the alarm? And if they can, what can I do to protect myself?
"
388,I (23F) encountered a lady with road rage and she physically slapped me and I have it on camera. Please I really need help.,"My question is how would the process be if I did press charges on her?

(I'm going to do my best to explain it visually, so please picture it to the best of your ability.)

I was leaving my neighborhood and stopped (at the stop sign) while waiting for these two people on bicycles to pass through. There was a car incoming on the left side of me, I can't tell the distance, and there was a car turning right on the other side of the road. I was heading left and the car in front of me was turning right, but they didn't do so. I made the left turn and all of a sudden a car comes behind me over powers me (this was a one lane road but big enough to have two cars) then she break checks me HARD. I started cussing and flipping out and my immediate reaction is to record.

We then hit another intersection, I'm turning right and she's turning left. She rolls her windows down, and we start cussing at each other, but once she rolls her windows down I said I was sorry but she didn't have to break check me so hard putting both of us and her passenger in danger. She got out of her car, and I could tell she was shaking so my other immediate reaction was to calm her down, I felt bad I have NO idea why. In the video you could see me reaching out my hand to calm her down and I also put my phone down because I felt it was making her more aggravated. So when I put my phone down I had slightly touched her hand and she hits my arm. Then I reach for my phone and you could see AND hear her slap me. Then her passenger gets out of the car and grabs her. My immediate reaction was to get her name, they refused to do that.

She turned to where she needed to go so I decided to follow her because she just had assaulted me and I wanted to understand why. In the second video you could see her leaning in my car, leaning in the window. She was yelling making false accusations that I was hitting her when I clearly didn't. So I told her I wasn't going to press charges and she said ""I know you aint"". I kept asking her passenger to calm her down and he said he was but he wasn't whatsoever. He told me to leave but I was getting so mad. I decided to follow her more and also called the cops once we stopped for the third time. While on the phone with the cops she got to her house, came out of the car and said ""are you happy now you know where I live"". While I was on the phone with the cops her passenger was standing outside my car smoking.

\*prior to this I was on my way to drop off some food to my boyfriend who has covid and we planned to meet half way so he knew where I was because the neighborhood also happens to be where my mom lives\*

When my boyfriend arrives the cops came shortly after. The officer asked me to explain and asked me what I wanted to do, and I asked him how the process would be and he said I'd have to go to court. I don't want to go through all that mess so I asked him he could just make sure she learns a lesson and not do it to anyone else. While the cops were talking to her my boyfriend was recording their talks and she started lying to the cops saying I called her a ""black bitch"" ( I addressed them as African Americans to the cop but I also know what's going on with police brutality that I told the cops that they have no firearms and the passenger didn't do anything out of violence and I didn't want to play race in this situation, but clearly she did.) She also kept saying I hit her when in the videos of us interacting you couldn't hear anything. She said that I ran a stop sign as well. She even admitted to hitting me but she said ""I didn't hit her hard because I knew she was a little girl"" (I am 4'11 & asian).

After the cops talked to her the officer came up to me and I felt like he was gaslighting me saying I should've just left in the begging and I have no business following people to their homes because I don't know what could happen to me. That it was all blown out of proportion and that at the end of the day nobody got hurt because nobody got shot. The whole time he was saying that I kept telling him I understood, but at the same time she slapped me. I'm stuck between wanting to move on but at the same time I am so paranoid she will press charges against me with false accusations.

&#x200B;

Please, I don't have any lawyers, I also don't have the money to even hire one. I just want my justice and to feel at peace. I don't want her driving on the road and I don't want to think every car is going to get pissed off at me just because I made a decision to turn left when it was safe to do so. I wasn't driving bad either. It escalated so bad.

I was told if I wanted to press charges I have to go to the police station but he didn't say a specific one. He also didn't make me write a report and also didn't give me papers to sign, just a card and that's it. Also the police station is closed on the weekends so I'll have to wait until Monday to get it handled.

Anything helps, just prayers or positive energy, I hate feeling uneasy but I can't stop thinking about it.

390,Is this April fool's prank legal?,"Edit: I got it. Bad idea don't do it. Thanks



I've been trying to come up with a harmless prank for April fool's. One idea I had was that if you take a sheet of plastic wrap like what you would wrap food with and place it against a car it will stick to the side with static electricity. It won't damage the car and can easily be removed with just your hands; it's basically a large static sticker.

If you first paint one side of the plastic and then stuck it to a car it will look like the vehicle was tagged, but won't cause any actual damage. If you went around town and stuck the ""stickers"" to random cars that were parked in public streets would you be breaking any laws?

In Washington state if it matters."

My landlord lives above me who is generally quiet, but her daughter is a nightmare. Her constant running and screaming is making me so nervous throughout the entire day/night. I'm really having a difficult time.

She never disclosed to me that she has a daughter which is the only reason I feel like I've been underhanded. But this kid literally makes the apartment uninhabitable.

393,HIPPA violation?,"USA, AZ
Recently I lived at an expensive residential rehabilitation center for young adults with drug addictions. We had weekly visits with our assigned therapists and after one of these visits, while waiting for an escort back to the house, I overheard my therapist call the director of the program and share with him verbatim what I had told her in my therapy session. I know for a fact that my therapist was considered a member of ""medical staff"" and the director is not a member of medical staff, so by their own rules they should not be sharing intimate details of my therapy session. 

So, after this happens I start talking about HIPPA, asking if what just happened was legal. Two days later my therapist was fired and on the same day I was kicked out of the rehabilitation program and dropped off at a homeless shelter. 

What can I do? Is there any legal recourse? I think they threw me out on the street thinking that would make the problem go away. Please advise!"
394,"Drove Off a Cliff, Accused of first DUI, Advice?","I was driving down a dark, rain soaked, 55 mph highway in the mountains at 2AM when a teenage driver cut me off going significantly slower than me. I decided to overtake her and didn't notice there was a left turn up ahead. As I had no time to turn, I flew off a cliff and a policeman found me some time later in dire conditions 20 feet away from my car that had tumbled down the hill. I was taken to the hospital and the officer told me he had a warrant for a blood test. After 2.5 months of thinking I'm in the clear, I was mailed an arraignment to appear in court because of a .087 BAC.

Just a couple things:

1. Since there was no arrest, when is my DMV hearing?
2. EDIT: Since I was not actually found in or operating my vehicle, can I fight the charges? Because what if I drank something on my person AFTER crashing?
3. EDIT: Which one should I get: a lawyer OR get a public defender?

I know it's absolutely wrong to operate a vehicle while intoxicated, and it should be avoided at all costs.

395,Having a service dog in a no pets apartment,"Background: I live in Cincinnati, Ohio and attend the University here. I recently moved into an apartment where I took over a lease. The previous tenant owned a dog for a semester and never had any problems. I also know of at least 5 other tenants who also own dogs against the lease agreement. My case is a bit different though.

Current situation: I received an email from the apartment company stating that they were informed I own a dog and it must be removed immediately or I would be asked to evacuate. I did some research of the Fair Housing Act and that states that if the dog provides emotional support and alleviates a symptom of a mental condition the dog can not be refused. I am diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and ADHD. I am currently prescribed two different medications. I adopted this dog as a therapy dog and she has greatly improved my quality of life. Do I have a case against my landlord to keep my dog? "
396,"I co signed a loan for a house/property in California in 2020. They needed my credit, income and home equity in order to make it happen. But now they want to take my name off of the loan/title.

They have some money saved but couldn't qualify for a loan because they didnt have an income at the time during the pandemic. I was  fortunate have my 40hr/week and also I was living debt free, my mortgage was paid in full about 6 months prior. They asked relatives from her family side but all said no. With all the uncertainty going on at the time, nobody took risks on them. Except me. My brother's credit was horrible so he couldn't cosign. Now with just her name and mine on the loan, we got a 30 year loan at a fix rate. 
I don't live there and I didn't put any money down or make any payments. When they approached me around 2.5 years ago asking for help, I should have gotten it all down in writing what's their intention because nobody can predict 2 year let alone 30 years how it will be. They told me they are starting the process of removing my name off of the title/loan and once it's ready will I sign it? My response was I will think about it. 
What do I get out of it if I sign it now? The difference in the value divided by 2? Can I stall for 30 years? And what if they miss making payments? Can I force my way to make payments on my behalf because then that would mean I'm contributing to the mortgage yes?

 I called gf during a big fight and she had a second phone recording me on speaker where I stupidly admitted out loud that we had been having sex but that we we're just friends now.  Gf was mad about the best friend sending me sexy pics too cuz she went through my phone and took pics of my phone with hers fuck. 

So gf threatened to send the video of the phone on speaker to my best friend's husband.  Needless to say I really don't want this to happen.   

I'm in Nevada where both parties have to consent to being recorded during a phone call.  The phone isn't lit up during the video she recorded so you can't tell she's talking to me but you can hear my voice.   The only name I mention is the best friend's kid cause she asked if I thought the kid was mine.   I think the husband will know for sure that is it me if she does send it. 

I told GF that the husband told me he would sue her if she sent the video to him and that made her even more pissed off cause she didn't believe me.  Best friend was the one who said she would sue her though. 

I threatened to call the cops if she sends it to him.  Can I sue her or put her in jail if she sends the video of the phone call or the sexy photos or even the screenshotted text messages?  Can my best friend sue her? "
401,"DUI FOR SMOKING WEEKS BEFORE DRIVING, LIFE RUINED","Note: I was fully sober at the time i hadnt smoked for at least 14 days because i was supposed to be going into the army until this messed up my entire future, court is in a few days

I had 3 witnesses in my car which were my friends, the officer also said that there is no dash cam or video recording!!!!

so im going to explain the full story , I live in pennslyvania

Charges: possesion of marijuana, paraphernalia(unopened box of cigars), wreckless driving, careless driving, failure to carry registration although i provided proof of reg. and insurance. DUI metabolite,  speeding in a work zone

i was driving to a ski resort on the highway, i was driving down I-78 going 77 and keeping up with the speed of traffic. upon driving at this speed i enter a work zone but still maintaining a speed of 77 about 500 feet after entering the zone i see a cop infront of me sitting at the corner about a quarter mile in front of me. i slow down before passing him but he pulls me over.  he came to the passenger side and said he smelled marijuana(which was in the back being rolled by a friend), they immediatlly pull me out of the car forcefully and handcuff me . they then tell me my tounge is green with a burn mark in the middle. Yes, this sounds ridiculous to me as marijuana does not turn your tounge green neither will u have a burn unless you swallow the blunt. I told them that i hadnt smoked for a week and they called bullshit. they said my eyes looked stoned(i have natural dark circles around my eyes ALL THE TIME thats just the way i look) . he did not give me any sobriety test. sent me straight to the hospital for a blood test.   i fully cooperated acted politely and told them where the weed was, i didnt tell a single lie.  now to the police report...

Officer blank pulled Me over going 77 in a 55 work zone. approaching the vehicle i could smell the odor of marijuana.  Suspect appeared to have bloodshot eyes and was talking in a slow slurred manor. when he exited the vehicle he stumbled upon himself heading towards the rear of the vehicle(right here, he never said this to me in person neither is it true, my eyes were in fact not bloodshot, i did not speak in any disabled manor nor stumbled or anything close. )

in the report it also said i admited to smoking before driving which is 100&#37; false i said these exact words to him . ""i do smoke, but the last time i smoked was over a week ago. I am 100&#37; sober. "" again i want to state that it was a normal day of driving, over a week after i had smoke anything or drank anything. i was in my right mind i expected the officer to smell the weed whenever i was being pulled over , i expected to get possesion charge, but i did not expect to get a dui, i also looked up the punishment for first offence marijuana dui is minimum of 72hours jail time, minimum license suspension for 18 MONTHS!!

There is a civil case that I have been called to testify in. I will not state the details but I am one of if not the key witness in this case. I was thee proceeding, during, and following the actions taken. The offending party most defiantly did what he is being accused of, the only problem is that the evidence so far has been hearsay at best and by my calculations I am the tipping point for this case. Because of this, I feel that I deserve a fair sum of money. If won, this case would pay out a large sum of money to the individual who initiated it. Much more than I plan to make in the next 20 years. Because of this and my importance to the case, I deserve a cut. Nothing unreasonable but I place my value at around 5% of the total payout. I have an email ready with these demands and my value to the case written up and will be sending it tonight. My plan is if they refuse I will simply state I do not recall to every question asked of me, losing her and her lawyer the case. My main question is how should I go about receiving fair compensation?

407,Got bit by a rat and admitted to hospital a day later. I can literally watch the infection spread and I have received nothing but questionable and atrocious service. The streaking has now reached my chest and I have not been given IV antibiotics for several hours.,"UPDATE:

I have been discharged. I'll be attending daily outpatient appointments for IV antibiotics. 

 Forgot to mention that Rat Bite Fever is in consideration with the specialist, and was my suspicion from the start, hence my panic. However, we are waiting for infection site to drain on its own to take a culture. I have developed a rash. Yes, I was warned that Doxy might affect my mental state, which also contributed to my panic. I was switched to something called Unicen (spelling?).

While I appreciate those of you who have given me solid advice and suggested that I simply need to calm down, I am feeling pretty bitter over how my post has been placed on bestof and how the rest of Reddit is calling me various things such as a drama queen and crazy, and whatever else concerning my dose of, ""speed,"" (adderall IR 20mg 3x/daily). 

I have PTSD and receive special accomodations for it. My anxiety levels were through the roof, and it didn't help that my bf and family were in an equal panic. My mom had probably called my nurse on the hour every hour the whole time I was there. My intention in posting here was not to find out if I could sue anybody, as the bestof post implies in its title, and as others rail on me for. I wanted to inquire as to whether or not i really was receiving standard treatment, or if my family was right in being upset and pushing me to complain. All of this is obvious as per my comments. I have been nothing but appreciative and respectful to everyone who I responded to. 

For those of you calling me dramatic; of course I was being dramatic. I was scared and confused, with PTSD triggers hitting me from all directions. To the self-proclaimed medical professionals of Reddit who did nothing but get together and slander me on a thread: you are the reason those with mental illness do not trust medical professionals and seek help. Your insensitivity is what we see online and expect in the real world. All we do is wonder what others think of us, or if we ARE crazy, or what we are doing wrong. I can't convince you to change your opinions and attitude, and believe me, I understand why some of you feel the way that you do, but I can ask that you voice those things in a considerate manner. You should already know this. 


Location is NY

I was bitten, actually more like scraped by the teeth of, a friends pet rat on my right pointer finger. The following day (December 7th) I went to work as normal and had no notable issues. The night of the 7th I awoke to pins and needles in my hand, bad joint and muscle pain, and swelling in the finger. The morning of the 8th I had to call out of work and arrived at the hospital around noon with streaking up my hand from the site of the bite. They took one look and said I needed IV antibiotics and sent me to Fast Track. There, they gave me an oral dose of Doxy and explained that there was no research to support that one IV dose of Doxy was any more effective. They outlined the streaking and sent me home with a prescription; told me to monitor the streaking and that the Doxy should stop it, and to come back if it spread.

I took a nap at home and awoke to the streaking having spread to my elbow. I went back to the hospital And explained my situation. They sent me to a room in the ER where they drew blood and put me on an IV antibiotic. This was around 9 or 10 pm. 

I'll try to have some brevity with this while being concise as possible:

They explain that I will be admitted. In a span of about 6 hours I had met, only once per person, about 6 NPs who I had to re-explain my situation to every time, while also getting vitals and a physical every time. I understand shift changes but this seemed excessive. 

Once I was asked about  my psych medication, I felt I was being sort of profiled, for lack of a better word. One NP asked my list of daily meds (adderall 3x a day, trileptil 2x a day, welbutrin 2x a day, flovent, albuterol) and when adderall was mentioned (20 mg) they asked me twice to verify the dose. They then left and 2 more different NPs entered the room 20 minutes later. Same round of questioning only this time they had a printed list in front of them sent by my psychiatrist and told me they had it afterwards. They left, and about an hour later another NP came in to tell me my new room was being prepared. She read off my list of meds to verify and then questioned me about my items. I had a jacket, wallet, t-shirt, and a backpack my boyfriend brought. He was out smoking a cigarette when she started questioning me about his backpack. There was a slight communication issue because of her accent but she kept repeating to me that I was responsible for the backpack. I asked her if they planned to search it or something, to which I also mentioned they would need my BF permission. She said no, but then kept repeating that she would have to list the backpack with the other items. I asked why that is a problem and she sighed and just wrote it down with a huff. 

This same nurse came back 20 minutes later to take vitals with that band that wraps around your arm and the thing they clip on your finger. This had to be really late in the night at this point. She set up antibiotic and saline iv as well and explained that my room was ready.  Then, without a word, she left the room with all of the equipment hooked up to me, and every 5 minutes it would tighten again which was rather annoying. Also my hand with the IV was freezing cold and the arm was throbbing with pain. Another individual came in about 30 to 45 minutes later, took one look at the IV bag and exclaimed, ""whoa that is going way too fast!"" The bag was already empty. He unplugged the equipment and left. 

It wasn't until maybe 3 am that I was rolled to the new room. I did not receive iv antibiotics again until maybe 8 this morning. In that 5 hours the streaking has spread and spidered up my arm to my chest. 

When I took the first pill yesterday morning I was told the spreading would stop. Today they are trying to comfort me in saying the antibiotics take more than a day to work and that's why it's still spreading. 

They never offered me breakfast even though the cafeteria worker had done her rounds and I had to ask three times for my scheduled psych meds, which I received 2 hours late and was suffering severe anxiety and agitation. 

The streaking is still spreading, the swelling increased, my finger is purple, I have pins and needles, joint pain, dull pain in chest. I keep telling them im concerned every time they come in and all they could tell me was they may give me a rabies shot, that they reported the bite to the health department, that the specialist from infectious disease won't arrive until later today. They did not take a culture. They placed me in a room with another patient knowing I may have an infectious disease. I have not had another IV since 8 and it's almost noon. My doses have been very inconsistent. There is only one nurse pressing for a specialist on my behalf and sees the infection may need drained. I have begun sweating. Dull ache in chest. Feel hot to touch but my hands are cold. It's exhausting to stand.

My bf is freaking the fuck out that they are not seeming to take this seriously. Says I have rights and wants me to speak to supervisor or legal rep. Do I even have a case? I feel like I'm on limited time and no one here cares."

We trusted this person so my friend with consent drank it and with words she encouraged my friend to drink it, saying it was a special drink she made and was persistent that she would drink it and enjoy her soecial drink. Im just shocked."
409,Police entrapment on Grindr for marijuana charge,"So, I got detained by the police for possession of marijuana. The police offered to drop the charges if I Made a deal with them. Which I took as ratting out one of the guys whom I bought it from. They let me go home, but when I went on Grindr; like tindr, but for gays, this guy I knew was clearly working with the police (I just knew); to try to get me to incriminate myself. Could I refuse any deal and argue effectively that the police where trying to incriminate me? The dude lives 18 miles from me, but he was the closest person in the screen. Next closest person was 300 feet. He doesn’t know where I live now. Should I still take whatever deal they offer?"
410,Hey reddit I’m scared and I need your help,"So the other day I was an idiot and sent $100 to another country for stupid reasons. Now I’m getting calls and text from a guy saying that if I don’t pay $460 or something like that he’s gonna contact my family and fine someone who can. Apparently his account got frozen because the money I sent went from US dollars to foreign currency but here’s the kicker, I did cash pick up and there’s no way for that to go into an account according to the company I used. What do I do?"
411,Company is changing how they do payroll. Can I make them do it another way?,"For like 11 years they payed cash. I've been here about 8 months or something. I see it as a perk of the job. 

They gave us a week's notice before changing over to a proprietary debit-like card that charges you to get cash. to me that's wagetheft with more steps. 

They also let us do direct deposit into a normal bank account, but they only gave us a week's notice and I'd basically have to take off work to make an account, and they don't let you ask off less than a week in advance. 

I'm probably more pissed off than I should be about this, but I just know my company is getting a money saving deal because they're exposing us to a 3 dollar fine every-time we want to get cash out of our shitty card. 

and if it matters, my job deals primarily with cash so it's not like they're saving a trip to the bank by doing this. So it's pretty much just an excuse to charge me to pick up my paycheck. 

can I do anything about this?

412,HELP NEEDED URGENTLY,"So I have a question, I was  accepted into a college at the beginning of this semester as a transfer student from another 4 year university. My grades weren’t the best leaving my first college so for the second one I buffed my official transcript to look more desirable to the school by photo editing. I spent like 4 or 5 days on it and you couldn’t tell the difference unless you were really looking for something specific. I was accepted and thought that everything was great, but we were registering for classes next semester and I have a hold on my account. I read deeper to see that the Admissions office is requesting another Official college transcript. I’m freaking out because I don’t know if I’m fucked and going to get expelled from the university for falsified transcripts or if they contacted my previous university and got my old grades that way, but I heard I can be taken to court for fraudulent acts against the school. Is there anything I can do to stay in this university?? Any help would be great I have to meet with the admissions department tomorrow afternoon."

414,How can I express my rights without being a dick to cops and without them reacting aggressively at me?,"I'm not the type of person that goes out of their way to be a dick to cops. I know most of them are just trying to do their job and I have nothing to hide. But I do believe that cops have an incentive to make arrests so I never really think that they'll be on my side if something ever turns messy.

I live in Michigan near the Metro Detroit area.

If I'm in a traffic stop or if I'm involved in a situation wear the police wants to talk to me, what can I do to legally protect myself without being a dick and attracting aggressive behavior. 

**EDIT:** Some of you seem to be giving me general advice and not *legal* advice. I'm already calm cool and collected when I talk to cops. I'm looking for advice on what to do when the cops around me around me are doing illegal shit when interacting with me. Its seems like all I'm getting is to just take it and try to fight it in court.

416,My brother (20) recently got accused of 2nd degree rape that he says was consensual. (Washington State),"My brother (20) recently got accused of raping a girl (18-19) in the 2nd degree. This happened over a month ago at a weekend-long party at a local kids house, but the charges were just brought on him in the last week (the police came and arrested him on the July 5th). My brother swears it was consensual, and I believe him. He's made some bad decisions in the past, but he would never do anything like this to hurt another person. According to him, this girl was running around the party topless and grabbing guys' junk while asking for sex. Later that night, my brother claims they had consensual sex. He also says that other people at the party can confirm her behavior on that night. Also, she allegedly had sex with one or more people the night prior. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and she is regretting what happened and decided to press charges. To my knowledge, my brother is the only one with charges being brought against him. 

Also worth noting, when my brother was 17, he landed himself a felony drug charge so I'm not sure how that will affect the case.

I have a couple questions about this case:
1. What is the best way to go about a case like this? (I'm sure there is no easy answer, I just know almost nothing when it comes to things like this.)
2. How do cases like this usually turn out?
3. How can we prove that she is lying other than just my brother's word vs her's?

I'm doing my best to help my mom with this situation, but being down in California for work has limited my ability to help, so any advice you guys can provide would mean a ton to me. My brother's court hearing is set for July 18th, so I will keep you updated."
417,Electric fence near my backyard,"Location: Carmel, Indiana

I live in a suburb that has grown significantly over the past 20-30 years. Most of the area is developed, but there are still some areas that have been farms for decades and still are. One farm is right behind my house. There is a \~6 foot tall chain link fence dividing the property lines. This farm recently got some cows, and they put in what appears to be an electric fence to keep the cows in.

My concern is that the electric fence wire is \~18 inches from the chain link fence, so my kids (ages  from 1-8) could reach across and touch the electric fence wire. From what I've read, this is at least potentially dangerous, depending on the type of electric fence it is.

I'm thinking of going and knocking on their door to get more information about the fence or ask them to move it, but I wanted to know what my options are first. Is it legal to have an electric fence close enough to my property that my kids could touch? Is there maybe some code requiring a certain setback or something? Calling code enforcement and asking them is an option, but I don't want to start off by kicking that potential hornets' nest without more information."
418,So I got arrested today,"I was on break at work. Chilling in the parking garage with my car on to run the ac. Eating a salad at the time. I see a cop car pull into the third floor, which I was on, and she rolled around 2-3 times, passing me each time before coming to a stop. I get out and ask her if I should leave. She approaches my car and tells me she smells weed.

She immediately arrests me and searches my car. No rights given to me. Also told me that I could contact my job but failed to let me do so, meaning that I was arrested and jailed and not even allowed to tell my job I wouldn’t be back from break (for the record I’m out on bail and went and closed the store afterwards, lmao). I now have a possession and paraphernalia charge for a couple of pipes and about .5g of bud. 

Does it matter at all that she searched my car and arrested me without reading my rights, or is that totally moot? Just curious.

I have no priors besides a trespassing charge for which I was given a Michigan HYTA plea, last year. Im a college student starting school in a few weeks so I’m assuming I will probably be given probation for the charges so long as I cooperate and take a plea from the prosecutor

I’m still very bothered by my own arrest though, I was approached for very little reason and I felt completely and utterly violated as I was simply sitting in my car eating my dinner. "
419,Should I [24M] send a letter to my pregnant Ex-GF [F21] ?," 

Hi Everyone,

I'm in a difficult situation and I'm looking for advice on how to handle. I will go into detail, so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom

Jan 2021: I work in a midsize office building and started talking with one of the receptionists. We eventually started hanging out and had a strong connection early on. TBH, I had recently gotten out of a long term (5 years) relationship. It was a bad break up.

Anyways, we've been talking for several weeks. She comes over to my house often. One night, she says she wants to have a baby. I told her this was crazy, but deep down I kinda liked the idea. I mean, that means we're gonna be together forever, right?

Late Jan 2021: She won't let up about the baby. I told her that we needed to be together for longer before doing that. She even put in her Calendar to remind us in Aug.

Valentines Day: I caved. We were making love and she held me with her legs, I came inside. She was very excited, I was very nervous...

We keep this a secrete for several weeks until she tests positive for being pregnant. She then tells her mom (She still lives with her mom). Her mom is disappointed at first, but quickly comes around to being a grandmother. I don't want to brag here, but I am very good with parents; she really liked me. I would joke that mom likes me more than GF did.

Cut to the thick of this pregnancy. She's sick - Really, really sick. She has Hyperemesis and cannot eat or drink for days at a time. We're in and out of emergency rooms, she's constantly throwing up. I can tell this is taking a toll on her. When she was with me, I took great care of her. She never needed to lift a finger when she was feeling bad at my house. However, she mostly wanted to stay at her house with her mom. I can understand this - She's constantly puking and probably embarrassed.

During these weeks/months, we saw less and less of each other. I spent this time building out a nursery. She designed it and it came out beautiful - Pintrest worthy lol. However, We would argue over text, and we just started growing distant. I never stopped trying, but it felt like she lost interest. About 6 months in, she wants to take a break. I give her a week and then try to reach out, we break up. At first she was talking about Co parenting, we both were on the same page about making sure the child came first. Then....

After she and her stepdad came to my house to get her stuff, and stuff we had bought for the baby, she unfriended me from facebook, and then the rest of her family blocked me entirely. My number is also blocked.

The baby is due in November. I've tried to send her a friend request, but she deleted the request. I want to know how the pregnancy is going. What do I do? My friend said to mail a letter, simply wishing her well and asking how the pregnancy is going.

I realize now that being with her was a mistake. Getting her pregnant was a mistake. It was a major redflag that she almost immediately wanted to have a baby. Maybe its not mine?

I mentioned that we worked at the same company, this is no longer the case. I left the job a few weeks after we broke up, so I don't see her in person anymore. She lives 10 mins away. It's been about 6 weeks since the break up.

Please if you have any questions, I'll give addition details in comments. I am so lost on what I need to do. I don't have much of a family to go to for advice.

TLDR: New GF wanted a baby, I put one in her (I know it was a mistake), she grew distant during her sickest weeks and I couldn't save it. It's now been 6 weeks since I've heard anything from anyone. I've been blocked on my phone and unfrinded on FB. Should I try to reach out by mail?

I also want to point out that I likely cannot afford much of a lawyer for this right now. Bottom line, I'm not trying to get this girl back. But I don't want her to use my lack of communication (Remember I am blocked) against me in the event of a child support case. Also, I hate saying this, but what's the best thing for me to do financially? Try to take on as much custody, or as little custody?

420,Spouse Videotaped Our Arguments to Use During Divorce Proceedings (PA),"My husband would like to “destroy me in court” as he puts it and has been recording our arguments to prove his case that I’m crazy. It was a very emotional time so taken out of context, it could appear that I was unstable. When in actuality it was me expressing my pain. Are these videos admissible in court? Should I expect a reasonable amount of privacy in my own home and not legally allowed to be recorded? Should I be worried about this?"
421,Can I be sued for exposing a racist business owner?,"TL;DR local small business owner is super racist and horrible on his personal Facebook and twitter and I want to expose him but don’t want to get sued. 

Hi all, I’m from a small town and there’s a local favorite sno cone place that everyone loves. I’ve personally known the owner (he franchised it and is the only one that works there) which when I was younger I thought practically gave me celebrity status but now has put me in the position I’m in. For years on his personal Facebook and twitter he has been making awful racist/xenophobic/homophobic/you name it posts. I’ve brought it up to people I know personally before but now more than ever it’s been weighing on me to make a public Facebook posts with screenshots I have compiled of his posts over the last 4 years. I hate seeing my friends who are active and vocal for BLM, gay rights, etc still going there, I know I would want to know if I was supporting someone who thinks like he does. 

My question is can he take any legal action against me for doing this? I simply want to post his own posts he has made on Facebook and Twitter, unedited of course, and just say do what you want with this info but I had to make it known because I know most customers dont know him personally so they don’t have him on Facebook to see for themselves. No call to action to burn his business down or anything of course. 

Thanks"
422,Car rental company gave away our car without notifying me.,"So me (19) and my GF (18) are on holiday in Sweden. Our plan was to rent a car and drive around the country for a bit. We reserved a car with a rental company, let's call them RC. All our overnight stays have been paid for in full and the rental car has also been pain for.

I just arrived at the airport to find out RC has given our car away to someone else, without notifying me first. RC has no other cars available for us to rent either, and without a rental car we cannot finish the rest of our holiday, consodering the fact that we need to drive a few long distances. 

It turns out the reservation for the car was made for the 20th of August, but today is the 21st. Appearently RC stated us as a no-show and gave the car to somebody else. However, when I look into the rental policy there is no talk of RC giving your car away to someone else. RC only has a no-show policy where you have to pay them a certain amount of money as a reimbursement for RC not being able to rent out your car. RC did however rent out my rental car, so it seems illogical for me to pay this reimbursement fee. 

On another note, I traveled all the way to the airport out of the city, which cost me even more money, does RC have to cover this cost for me or not? Considering they had me travel to the airport without notifying me there was no car there. 

All of this is Swedish law, I suppose.
Any advice at all is very welcome.

EDIT:
We went to another one of RC's locations and they gave us a free upgrade to a higher end car, so at least we can finish our holiday.

Thanks to everybody that did not understand my question properly and immediately thought I am an entitled prick. I am not, I was just asking if I would be able to get all my money back, considering I could really use it. My English just isn't perfect so I might've worded some things poorly. One guy even used this post to bash on Americans and timezones, when neither of them is even mentioned in this post."
423,Road Rage in [CO]," 

Okay, I did something where I know I was totally in the wrong and I wasn't behaving as well as I should've. Let's just get that out there. Onto the situation:

Today I was driving in Colorado and a car with a young woman (mid-20s) tried to cut me off. Having none of it, I accelerated to prevent her from doing so (it was the best way to avoid an accident, she seriously had NO ROOM to get in). Naturally, she got furious and started doing everything she could to pull alongside me. She was flipping me off, screaming and swearing at me out her window, and doing all the usual things. Normally, I wouldn't engage, but today I wasn't in the best mood. Thinking stupidly, I did the thing that I thought would piss her off the most. Instead of your usual middle finger or something like that, I did the ""eating out"" hand/tongue symbol, where you make a ""V"" with your fingers and put your tongue in it. I was upset and knew that would piss her off WAY more than if I just flipped her off in return. Not surprisingly, I was right. She went berserk.

She immediately whipped out the camera phone, and stopped her car in front of me to start getting video of me and my license plate. Then, I saw her on the phone (I'm assuming with the police). Normally, I wouldn't be too worried about this because I'm 99% confident I didn't break any laws. From what I've been able to find, the Supreme Court has ruled that giving the finger is protected by freedom of speech, but this wasn't exactly the middle finger.

Full disclosure, I am on probation for something completely unrelated.  My biggest concern is that because I'm on probation, this will be made into a much bigger deal if she pulls the sexual harassment card.

As far as I know, she has no concrete evidence that I even made that gesture, but you can never be too sure these days. Short of the gesture, I didn't engage her in any other way. I stayed in my lane, went the speed limit, and went off on my way home. She didn't follow me, I made sure to check.

Does she have any legal recourse? Would cops actually show up at my door and try to arrest me for this? Did I break any laws? 

To anyone who is going to send me hate mail, let me just say I know what I did was wrong, and I don't feel good about it. Sometimes I have a tendency to ""hit where it hurts"" when I'm upset, and that's what I did here. It was a stupid mistake and the fear I'm in right now has ensured I'll never do anything like this again."
424,[UPDATE#2] My neighbor is getting beat badly.,"I'm back. And to be honest I wish I never asked for advice here. Things have gotten really bad since I followed the advice and guilt tripping that I received. I'll try to keep it as short as possible, but it's pretty lengthy and complicated. Here we go.

Lots of shit went down on Friday night. We're gonna call asshole upstairs Kris and his wife Kelly and her sister Rachel for sake of the story. Kelly went and picked up Rachel to stay for the weekend with them. Which I thought was odd since he was supposed to move out Saturday (of course I knew he wouldn't, but still). They've been having loud sex the past few days, which they always do in between fights. (sigh) Anyway. Rachel comes over. Kelly asks me if I can follow her to take Kris' truck to the garage and drop it off so the garage can work on it Saturday. So I did. Left my husband at home with my two girls and her one girl. Her two boys rode with her. Rachel stays home alone with Kris. Bad idea.

So we're on our way home (dealership is an hour drive away) and he's blowing up Kelly's phone. He's drunk. Got into the liquor she had hidden from him. He's saying she needs to be home in 30 seconds or he's going to pound her face in. She tells me to keep going past the house and don't stop. I'm thinking she's finally going to go. I was very wrong.

We get to the next town and we stop at the gas station so I can go to the restroom. I come out and she's on the phone with him again. He's arguing with Rachel. I don't know all the details of it but he says he told her something she didn't want to hear and tried to call 911 and he took her phone. She's saying how ditsy she is and I'm telling her that Rachel wouldn't want to call 911 unless she thought she had to. I said he may have beaten or raped her. (Kris mentioned how hot Rachel was previously, I just had a suspicion) She said no, he wouldn't do that. Okay.

Well they're on the phone and he's drunk as hell and she hears him say, ""I'm feeling really lightheaded"" and the line goes dead. So she's freaking out that he passed out or died or something. So I call my husband to go check on him. (cause let's be honest, regardless of his trashiness and how horrible he is I can't in good conscience allow someone to die if I could help). Husband finds him the shop, not breathing. Husband gives Kris chest compressions and calls a bus. He started breathing again before they arrive and they take him to the hospital. (he has liver issues [surprising, huh?] and heart problems)

We go back to the house so she can get some things and her daughter and go to the shelter. As soon as we get there I go upstairs looking for Rachel. She's nowhere to be found. I'm freaking out. She doesn't live near us (actually, in another state, about 2 hours drive) and knows nobody in the area. We looked under beds and in closets and everything and she's gone. What the fuck did that bastard do to her?! At this point husband says he heard a girl upstairs say no no no don't touch me.

So I call 911 myself. Tell them about Kris and that I can't find Rachel. They put me on a three way call with the state police. I'm telling them about Kris beating Kelly and the operator interrupts me and says let's focus on the raped girl first. (as I referred to her as such as I said it's a possibility based on what husband heard). Cop says, ""Oh her? She called us and we're in route to her now. She's safe. We know where she is."" I felt relief and dread at the same time. He referred to her the same way I did. He confirmed it. They said they're going to talk to her then be over to us. She ended up at neighbor's house down the road. They took her via ambulance to the hospital to get tests run.

While all that's going on, Kris calls Kelly. Of course she answers the phone. Says he's done at the hospital and needs a ride. She asks to borrow my car to go get him. I said no. He can find his own way home. He calls my phone. I answer and put him on speaker. He tells me, ""You better find me a way home or when I get there you're not going to like me."" Husband flips. I flip. I'm like now you're threatening ME? I have to wait on the cops for the girl you fucking raped. Husband jumps in and says something to the effect of ""how dare you threaten my wife."" Kris says, ""Shut the fuck up old man or when I get back we'll see how much of a man you really are.""

I hang up. Kelly is saying she isn't going to talk to the cops. She's scared of his sister and Kris hurting her dad and mom and shit. I knew it. I FUCKING KNEW IT. She isn't gonna say shit. The second the cops come she hauls ass up the stairs. Leaves her kids down there with me. (wtf, they're all awake) Then proceeds to constantly text me telling me she wants her kids. I didn't say a word to the kids about going up.

Cops talk to me. I show him the video and pictures of her beating and bruises. Tell them what little I know about the Rachel incident. They want to talk to her. I text her and tell her to come down and talk to them. She says no. Cops says she needs to come down and collect her children and answer questions about what she knows about Rachel and if she doesn't come down, they're coming up.

She comes down and she's evasive thru the whole thing. Half answers and shit. Says, ""Rachel mentioned she didn't have her phone."" I butted in and said, ""No, you told me he said he took her phone because she tried to call 911."" *gives me death glare* Cops looks at her and tells her he knows what happened and to quit playing games with him. He said he didn't need her information and he already has a laundry list of charges on Kris. She still remains tight lipped.

Other cop takes her into the shop and talks to her about the beatings. She denies everything. Won't say a word about it or speak against him. So when she goes up I ask what options I have. He said none really. I'm shocked. I say wtf? I have video evidence of this stuff happening. He's threatened myself and my husband. He's pointed guns and bow and arrow and my husband. I have two small children in the house. He said, and I quote, ""well, we can't do anything about something he MAY OR MAY NOT DO IN THE FUTURE. And after checking the charges we have against him as of now, they're all misdemeanors and I can't arrest him unless Rachel's blood tests come back that he drugged her."" (Note: she's saying he ""felt her up"" [cops phrasing, not mine] and not raping her. Which apparently is the difference between a felony and misdemeanor in this case) So they can't go arrest him for anything. They can't arrest him when he gets back and he was currently looking for a way back. I asked what about the kids? He said they'll have to open and investigation about it. They can't just take them.

So I'm dumbfounded at this point. He's fuming at us, on his way back, and threatening to do god knows what to us and the cops won't do fucking shit. They recommended me moving or getting them evicted. WTF. Seriously, WTF!? So exactly what I've said multiple times in the other posts happened. The cops didn't do shit, he knows I called them, and I'm fucked. No good deed, for sure. Cop says I need to call when I'm hearing the beating or when I'm getting threatened and they'll come back out. (let it be noted it took them an hour to get there as it was) I said I may as well call you and the coroner and when you both get here we'll see which is needed. (And seriously, he threatens me again and I call, then what? You fucking bastards didn't do a damn thing to help us the first time, what makes me think you will the second?)

So we left as soon as the cops did. Packed only what we needed, very quickly, and fled to my mothers house. We passed a taxi not 3 miles from our house. (we don't have taxis around here. It was him. We left with minutes to spare) Still here now. Luckily, my mother owns the building and is giving them an eviction notice tomorrow. Not sure if it will stand up in court (I have no fucking faith in the justice system or police at this point anymore), but she's going to try. Until then my life and my children's are completely turned upside down and THAT STUPID BITCH STILL DIDN'T LEAVE HIM! My kids will be missing the rest of the school year and I'm sending them to their dad's house to be even safer for them for a while. My dad is serving the papers Monday so we're going to stay here as long as necessary I suppose. Which may be for fucking ever as of course he knows where I live and the cops aren't going to do shit if he threatens us again.

So my life is fucked as well as my kids'. The kids of Kelly and Kris' are still seeing everything and suffering. She's still suffering. And now I'm living in even more fear. 

Fuck me, right?

Edit: I do have a question. Why can someone threaten you multiple times with a deadly weapon, and you have evidence of them doing so, and nothing be done about it? Why is that not a serious thing?
"
425,"Can I get a restraining order based on this? If not, what are my options?","I am in SC.

Ok. Here is the situation. Quick background. Ex wife is living with her girlfriend in a lesbian relationship. I divorced her based on a provable affair she had with this woman. Both women are, without being officially diagnosed, clearly Borderline Personality Disorder. I was always a little concerned for my safety since this whole thing started but it was just a concern and nothing material I could present to the courts to get any kind of restraining order. I got primary custody of my kids. I have always felt they are working one on child at a time to alienate them from me to have them ""want"" to live with them. They do get visitation. My 3 kids are teens 16, 15 & 13. They have successfully converted the 16 year old against me and he is horribly abusive to me. Hates me with a passion for no reason. I am a good person, a gentle soul, and a  ""textbook"" model father. I am well educated and a white collar business person. It's a clear case of parental alienation at work by both the mother and the girlfriend.

The girlfriend is telling the kids that she is their new step parent and all other kinds of manipulative stuff. She is proven to have a temper and I would say is unpredictable. Let's call her ROSA. Her ex husband had a domestic violence charge against her that was eventually thrown out by the court.

Now here is my question.... 

There was a heated three way conversation yesterday with my son, his mother (my ex wife) and me. A car pulled up to the driveway so I paused looked out the window and said, I wonder who that is? My 16 year old says with the calmest tone and without any hint of it in any way being intended humor.... ""I think it's the hit man that Rosa hired"".

Now the point is, whether that was said in jest or not, it is pretty evident in my opinion that that has been discussed. Something like that does not come out of the blue out of the mouth of a 16 year old unless it was thought or discussed. I genuinely fear for my safety. Do I have enough here to take this to a judge and get a restraining order against Rosa both against me and a restraining order against the two crazies and keep my children away from them toxic ways?

I have it recorded. I recorded the entire 2 hour conversation. Throughout the recording you can also hear the hatred for me by my son that has been built up in him against me. Speaking to me very abusively and throwing F words around left and right.

In that recording I also have my ex wife admitting that Rosa has a temper and I also have a previous recording of Rosa verbally exploding at me another time where I saw rage in her eyes that almost erupted. 

What can I do with what I have? (Mainly based on yesterdays recording) I need my kids way from these crazies and I also genuinely fear for MY safety. You hear stories every day of ex husbands being knocked off, either by the ex wife, their lovers or even kids whose minds have been poisoned. I might be one of those stories if I don't act.

I am in SC."
426,Friend accidentally poisoned someone,"My friend (who lives in Florida) was fired from their job, and believed it was unjust because of a co-worker trying to get them fired.

The attempts to get my friend (Fr from here on out) was approached on the floor of business that had customers and coworkers by the owner of this particular business (franchisee). Owner told Fr that Fr couldn't do anything about being fired, Fr can't defend herself or do anything to keep Fr's job. Fr felt attacked/humiliated in public.

Fr saw some hand sanitizer and put two squirts in owner's water while she was away with the intent to make her taste something terrible. Realizing this was out of character and a result of being humiliated and overly emotional, Fr tried to pour all of it out of the cup, but the owner started coming back so Fr put owner's cup back on the counter before the owner saw that Fr had been holding it.

Owner takes one sip, asks out loud if someone put hand sanitizer in the drink, Fr and another employee laugh (the employee tried to hide their laughter, Fr didn't because they had already been fired and hadn't realized that isopropyl alcohol is the active ingredient and didn't realize how harmful it is to ingest).

Fr told me casually in a text what had happened, and I immediately realized that it was not just a simple prank and could seriously hurt someone. I spoke with Fr and told them that the cops might get involved if the owner presses charges, and under no circumstances to talk to them about this particular thing without legal counsel first because it is not as harmless as Fr thought.

Fr had no idea that the way hand sanitizer cleans is by using a chemical that is dangerous to ingest. Fr thought it was just like soap, and was the first thing in sight that was available to make the owner feel uncomfortable and taste something bad, and told me after the fact that if something like cayenne pepper or salt was readily available and in sight that Fr would have put that in her drink.

There was no intent to do actual harm, it was in Fr's mind just a petty thing to make owner taste something gross. This whole event was captured by CCTV. Police called her asking for a statement regarding a call to corporate about being unjustly fired, but luckily I was able to talk to Fr first as I said before, so Fr didn't meet with the authorities (Fr was not home either way). Investigator said they'd leave something at Fr's door for a statement regarding a vague investigation, but there was nothing there hours after the fact. I'm pretty sure they want to take Fr into custody because owner pressed charges. Maybe I'm being paranoid?

How bad is this situation for Fr, worst case scenario? I have a passing interest in law, but never went to school or anything for it. They have no way to prove intent if there was no previous incidents of threatening or malice, right? Florida states tampering with a drink can be a first degree felony with intent to kill or harm, but am I right in thinking that the prosecutor would have to prove intent/motive for that to stick?

427,Unwanted guest,"How do I get someone out of my house that I really hate. Bin living here. I cant ask them or its chaos in my family and I dont want police. They have their own apartment too.

428,My 17 year old niece was arrested after a traffic stop and her rights have been violated every step of the way,Our family needs help. My niece was in a car accident where the other driver died. My niece was not conscious and the sheriff searched her phone without her consent. The sheriff says the phone was in her hand and not locked so him seeing the text message she was typing was okay. The sheriff arrested her at the hospital and handcuffed her to the hospital bed and they took her to jail instead of letting her recover there. She wasn't a threat to run away but they still cuffed her and put armed guards on her. They did not allow her parents to be present when she was questioned by then even though she is underage! They also went online and looked at her Facebook page because one of the text messages she sent mentioned a selfie she just took. Her bail was set so high that it impossible for us to pay it even though she has never been arrested before and has no criminal record. She is still sore from the accident but the jail won't give her a soft bed to rest on like she needs while she recovers. It seems the sheriff wants to throw the book at her even though she is just a kid. Our family is from Virginia but this happened in Illinois when they were on a trip but they won't send her back to a jail here so she can be close to her family and her parents can't afford to stay there forever. We want to get a civil rights lawyer to get her to get released and make this to end but we don't know where to start.
429,Piece of Sports Memorabilia Contains Athlete's Personal Information,"I have in my possession an internal police printout from an arrest of a famous athlete. It includes personal details of the athlete along with the athletes front and side view photos from the arrest.

Nothing on it is anything outside of public knowledge except it has the athletes Social Security Number.

I am looking to get the autograph authenticated and potentially look at selling this piece of memorabilia but the inclusion of the SSN has me wanting to know the precedent.

Should I black out all or part of the SSN? 

Am I in the wrong possessing this ""as is"" or would I be in the wrong trying to sell it ""as is""? 

If the athlete were to pass away would that make a difference?

I also want to use a professional service to verify the autograph and want to make sure I have everything squared away with the SSN before doing that."
430,Soon to be ex-wife insists we're going to be splitting ALL assets - including my bitcoin,"[Ohio] My wife and I have been together for 9 years, married for 5. We have a 5 year old daughter together. I invested in bitcoin fairly early and made a fair amount of money from it. My wife always hated me throwing money away on it and tried to encourage me to stop - it lead to a lot of arguments and became a contentious part of my marriage (albeit one of many). 

Throughout our marriage I had a much higher wage than she did. we bought a house together (that I put up the majority of the cash for) a few months prior to getting married and had a shared bank account that she completely cleaned out (taking roughly $12,000) right before she decided it was over. Throughout our marriage I contributed about 75%+ of my wage to our home and family life, and used the additional 25% mostly on my own investments. She contributed to a few bills her and there but given her meagre salary she was mostly able to keep her own money for luxury spending. 

Since splitting my ex has been having some sort of breakdown and sending me endless text messages and harassing me over the phone about how horrible a person I am/ how badly I messed up her life and how she knows I'm trying to ""f**k her over and hide all my assets in that bitcoin shit"". I browse this sub enough to know one thing -  I've saved a copy of all the text messages and recorded some of the phone calls (not sure if this is legal, or of any use in a courtroom) in case it comes in handy later.

When I spoke to my lawyer about the divorce originally I didn't mention much about my investments in crypto-currency (we still haven't had a proper face-to-face yet) but it seems ex wife mentioned it to her lawyer and he's confident they can at least get a settlement for half of the perceived worth of my bitcoin. This could be my ex making stuff up or misinterpreting him though.

What makes the problem worse is my wife has no idea how my investments are doing, or even a basic understanding about bitcoin. If I had to total up my personal savings, investments in crypto-currencies and 'traditional' investments I'd say they currently sit in the $120,000 range but she's convinced herself I've always been lying about the value of what I have. She's insisting I have $600,000+ hidden and seems determined to get it. I'm worried she's also going to try to paint me as a bad guy trying to selfishly hide personal wealth so he doesn't have to support his own daughter.

Have there been any divorce cases where assets were held in crypto-currency? Is a Judge likely to award her half of the perceived value of my bitcoin? It seems a little unfair to have to split it when it I had to make the investment while listening to her nag me not to, and after she selfishly cashed out our shared savings. I'm VERY worried people might buy her sob story about the horrible ex-husband hiding his assets in this new technology and believe her dumb claims about the value - especially if they're a technologically challenged as she is. Am I likely to get in trouble for this?"
431,Teacher Engaged in Long-Running Conspiracy to Sabotage My Future and I Have Documented Evidence. Can I sue?[TX],"The title might seem slightly hyperbolic but I assure you that everything I'm going to tell you is real and is fully correct. I've been in the same school over the past 4 years and during the course of the studies one teacher has made it their mission to sabotage me via poor teaching, selective enforcement, biased rounding, slanderous comment and false political allegations

The teacher is an enemy of my parents because of some business dispute long-ago so he has decided to enact revenge on me. It began by making minor errors in the marking of my tests often just enough to bump grade down a letter which I just assumed was because he was lazy/tired but after consulting with my peers I realized that the only person that had been sloppily marked had been me. He refused to make any changed claiming that the grades had already been set in stone

I came back to school the next year and all my other instructors were treating me differently inquiring I realized that the teacher had claimed that my parents had spent thousands of dollars on tutors but neglected to mention that the same was true for most of my peers as well. The teacher had all taught that most of my good-grades and high-quality work came from the tutors instead of my own talent and hard work which denied many Extracurricular acitivties which are necessary for college application.

He just so happened to neglect to add me to an email informing everybody of change in school citation/plagiarism policy which forced me to re-write a month long project in weak causing my grades to plummet. Actions such as these have continued causing my true potential to be wasted and for my college application to have a distorted picture of me 

I have documented evidence for all the above incidents, and since I've been unable to gain admission anywhere except for a state university. I'm angry and ready to sue, DO I have a case? "
432,[NC] Employee transitioning from Male to Female - Sales are falling,"I run a retail store in North Carolina that targets a fairly conservative, traditional customer base. Two years ago, we hired a new male employee that was responsible for customer service, including answering customer questions, working the register, providing refunds/exchanges, etc. Six months ago, this employee started coming into work wearing mascara and press on nails. I called him into the office to talk about this and he mentioned that he had decided to transition from a man to a woman and was hoping that it wouldn't affect his employment. I told him that I respected his decision, but that I would appreciate if he kept the more flamboyant parts of his transition outside of the store. The pattern since then is that he is continuously becoming more and more flamboyant. Every time, I remind him of our conversation and he tones it back for a couple of weeks before ramping it up again. Today, he came in with a wig, full makeup, press on nails, earrings, the whole bit. If it weren't for our uniform, I'm sure he would've worn a dress with heels.

This has not affected his work performance. He's still doing his job. He arrives on time, is helpful to customers, and accurate with the register, but the sales in the store are down over 10&#37; compared to last year. I have had a few customers comment on his appearance and my response is usually a joking brush-off about it being 2018 or that if Bruce Jenner can do it, why shouldn't this guy. But in 15 years of being open, we've never had a down year, much less one so drastic like this one. The only thing I can think of is that we're losing customers due to this employee. Even though customers won't overtly complain about it, I believe they're taking the business elsewhere to not have to face this employee.

My legal question is: How do I deal with this employee that is affecting the sales of my business without bringing on a discrimination lawsuit or potential bad press regarding being discriminatory? I'm honestly thinking of suspending him today, but have no work-related cause other than he basically came to work dressed like a woman. What are my options r/legaladvice?"
433,"Help. My son is being accused of sexual assault, including drugging his ""victim.""","Crosspost from r/legal

Edit: Oregon

I'm an older redditor, but I've been around here for over five years and I know how amazing this community can be when the rubber meets the road.

I just found out about this situation today; this is a dumpster fire of brobdingnagian proportions, and I'm casting about for input. For obvious reasons, I can't share a lot of details because I'm trying to support my son without muddying the waters of emmerdement in which he has suddenly found himself swimming.

This young man is a STEM-field phD candidate at a large university in his mid-30s. He met a girl at a bar, drinks were had, one thing led to another, and sex took place. According to my boy - and I believe him, because I raised him and I know his heart - it was 100% consensual and he made sure of that before proceeding.¹ The encounter took place in the middle of last year, but six months later the woman filed a complaint with the university that she was drugged and raped, and has found himself in the middle of the bureaucratic horror that is a University's disciplinary system. His career, which he has expended immense effort to launch - largely by dint of pulling himself up by his bootstraps and a lot of hard work - is in jeopardy. In this age of #MeToo - which is, by the way, a critical and timely and important movement - this is the worst possible social time for a young man to have to deal with this kind of accusation, especially at Universities which are more interested in preserving their reputations and their funding than in pursuing justice.

He has a university-appointed attorney/counselor, and while she's helping him put together his defense, she's basically defeatist and telling him ""You're going to be expelled, just prepare for it."" He's a broke doctoral candidate, I'm a retired man of very limited means, and I'm untutored in the byzantine labyrinth we call the law. I'm also thousands of miles away from my son, so it's rough.

Clearly he needs a competent criminal defense attorney that is not connected to the university, but how to do that without going into the poorhouse is beyond me. What I'm hoping for is input, as Johnny Five says, ""megabytes of input. Anything at all would be appreciated

**Additional note**: I've been through the wiki here; sheesh, the law is complex. I have read the section on incapacitation and consent, but I don't know really how that works when two people get silly at a bar and sex is had. If only the victim is drunk and assaulted against her will, that's clearly one thing. But if both are potted and consent was clearly asked for and given, how does that rise to the level of assault?

¹ Just living in the world and following the news for over 65 years is enough to convince me that most parents are all, ""Oh, my kid is a good kid, he/she would never do something like that."" But guess what, they would, and they did. No, parents don't know everything about their kids - but I will pin my own reputation to that of my son, and if he goes down, I'm going down with him."
434,I (19M) am planning to report myself to my college for the sexual assault of a (ex)close friend (18F). What should I be prepared for.,"This happened in Michigan. This has all been so sudden and scary. I never thought I would be this person. After coming back from a party a week ago she and I engaged in sexual activity. I'm not sure how much detail I should go into so I'll just summarize. 

After returning from a party she and I were both fairly intoxicated. At this point I was aware that she was significantly more intoxicated than I was and that her judgement was impaired.

Maybe 1-2 hours later we were in private. She told me that she was beginning to sober up. She initiated contact by moving my hand onto her breasts. I asked for and recieved consent twice. No clothing was ever removed and I only used my hands (I'm sorry if I'm using weird language I really dont know how to talk about this comfortably). This went on for a while until she abruptly got up and left.

The next morning a recieved a text telling me that I comitted sexual assault, and that she did not plan on reporting me to the college or the police as long as I never tried to contact her. I have not attempted to contact her.

I feel extreme guilt. This person was a close friend and I can't live peacefully knowing I hurt anyone this badly let alone somebody this important to me. I believed everything was consensual. Im not sure if I had reason to know if she was mentally incapable to consent given the circurmstances. I feel that the right thing to do is to report myself to my college to at least open am investigation. If I comitted assault I don't want to run away from it. 

What should I be prepared to face, and what should I do before I report the incident? What should I do in general?"

436,"My grandmother died of complications from COVID-19, but COVID-19 isn't on her death certificate. How do we dispute this? (FL)","My grandmother (95) resided in a nursing home Florida and had no significant health concerns, just difficulty with mobility. She tested positive in November and had mild symptoms over the next few weeks. About a month later she developed a blood clot in her leg, which the virus is known to cause. She was treated for the blood clot at a hospital and released back to the nursing home. We were led to believe she was stable, however she suddenly passed away a few days later.

My dad got her death certificate in the mail and we were surprised to see that COVID-19 wasn't listed as a primary or secondary cause of death, and neither is the blood clot. The primary cause listed was a respiratory infection. 

How do we dispute this? Would a lawyer be the only way, or do we start with the nursing home or the hospital or the county or a state representative or...? To make things worse, we all live in Pennsylvania, so we would be doing this from afar. 

I'm wondering if the coroner labeled her death as such so that the nursing home wouldn't have to have this count towards their number of COVID-19 deaths.  From what I read in the news, I'm guessing a lot of COVID victims are never officially identified."
437,The horros story of my morning chickens,"The neighbors dog killed two of my chickens at 8am today. My wife, landlord and I are devastated. I have video and photo evidence of this and I am running outside every 5 mins to check on them with my heart racing every time they make a sound. I don't know where to post the video/pics, but I have contacted my local town hall, and was assured that a sheriff will be starting paperwork about this considering the amount of horror we woke up to.

(First time chicken owner)

 Long story short, I'm going to write this in the likeness of a suspense story.

 I need the guidance so maybe it will help keep you reading & because it helps me cope with what I'm writing. Thank You

 

I woke up this morning earlier than usual to a sound that brought chills down my spine. I ran outside to see whats good. A stranger has infiltrated my safe-haven... The neighbors dog looked back at me like a deer in the headlights. The damn mutt dug through the fence and was lurking. I see one chicken to my left, my baby girl Big Red (RUSS/RED), I see to my right my Denver John. (Speckle BLK/WHT). I tell the mutt to GTFO (PETE!, GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY YARD!!!) I started video recording with one hand and my dog (Big Louie) chased him around. I was furious beyond words. After the mutt gets back to it's own house, I walked to my back yard to complete silence. Wait, whats good with the chickens! My vision blurred and the world slowed down like the south park ""Imagination Land"" When the breach happened and time slowed after Stan got hit... I saw feathers that lead to the carcass of the other Russian red. naturally, i was going to wrangle up my loves and inspect everything else. toward the other side of the yard i see the grizzly remains, torn and horrifying details left out. This is a nightmare.

438,Legally screwed by MN. Any legal advice to help with an interlock situation?,"So my boyfriend got a dui and got the intoxalock. He completed his amount of time. Except when he went to get it off he was informed that he has over 60 violations elongating his sentance from 1 year off 6 months ago to now being required by our state not intoxalock itself to have it till 2022. Its 200 a month. Its acts up all the time causing him to miss or be late to work. Which is why I'm writing this now. We have a 6 month old baby and in MN its below 0 most of winter and he can never warm his car up. Its a safety issue by distracting him from the road. He has followed every rule and completed what was needed.. Whenever the camera was off or there was an issue they would call him... But never called to tell him that he was receiving these violations of missed tests for simply warming his car up. He is 3 years sober and followed literally everything to a T and is being shot at like a target because apparently interlock and the state don't talk so they had no way of knowing about his violations. The time to ""appeal"" was past due when he found out about the lengthening of his interlock time. And even if he did he would have to write over 60 appeals. Anything we can do to fix this?"

I'm almost at the halfway mark and I have been put on non reporting by my probation officer, due to completion of requirements and good behavior. My probation officer agreed to allow me to appeal to the court for early dismissal. It's been a really tough 6 months for me and about 2 months ago being a student that works I forgot to shave for a few weeks and started to grow a beard. Now a little over a month away from my appeal my beard is almost perfect, in one month it should be completely full. My beard has been an important symbol to me as I've matured through this past 6 months and I'm curious if I should shave it before my appeal. I really don't want to but I'm unsure of how it would affect my appeal. I plan on trimming it befor court and even using it to describe how it has symbolized my maturation. Is this silly? Should I shave it? If anyone has some advice, past experience or even an educated opinion please weigh in! Thank you!!"
440,New Jersey-I lied about my kid's rabbit being vaccinated and it bit my neighbor's daughter.,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I know this was a stupid move on my part but I never thought it would escalate to something like this. A month ago I bought a rabbit off Craigslist for my daughter. I wasn't provided any papers on it being vaccinated. I know, dumb. Last week my daughter's four year old friend was over the house playing with the rabbit and it bit her. Her mother was understanding at first and asked if the rabbit was vaccinated. I said it was and thought nothing of it. 
Well two days ago we found the rabbit dead in its cage. My daughter told her friend who told her mother. Apparently the mother called her pediatrician and the doctor asked her to get proof the rabbit was vaccinated. Well, obviously I can't provide that. 
Now the kid may have to get a rabies test or shot which is apparently like 30 shots in the stomach. Her father came over the house the house tonight and threatened to beat me up if his daughter had to get the shots. I frankly felt threatened. 
My question is how will this affect me legally? Can they sue? Can I press charges for the dad threatening me? Again, I know I messed up but I'm just trying to figure out the legal repercussions. Thanks. "
441,"[CA] Dad killed by a cop in the late 90s, settled for $1mil against city for a fraction of the initial suit. Is it possible to reopen this issue?","I'm 24.  Currently trying to improve my career path so I Google myself from time to time.  I just did that and realized that there is now a fucking Wikipedia article on his shooting and death.

A brief summary of what happened.  I was 5 at the time and have found out everything I know from old 90's/00's online articles, I don't wanna ask my mom about any of this.  So my dad was at a bar after work one night celebrating a new job with a buddy.  At one point some racist pieces of shit decided to throw some racial slurs and attacked and stabbed him with a dart.  A fight was about to break out but the barkeep knew my dad, attempted to defuse the situation and sent him home in a cab.  But he was drunk, stabbed with a dart, and was obviously upset and making noise in the street late at night.  Neighbors called the cops, two showed up, the latter shot my dad shortly after arriving on scene, on our driveway.

In court, the cop's justification was that because my dad was Asian, he was acting in a threatening martial arts manner.  He'd never taken martial arts, he worked at a software company as an engineer.  This marked nearly the 10th racially-motivated police shooting in 2 years in that county.  There were several investigations but all concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the cop for wrongdoing (surprise!).  So my mom lost the $50million federal suit and had to settle for $1 million, most of which was gone after lawyer fees and moving expenses.

My mom received a pittance for my dad's death after the lawyers had their cut.  They tried, but either weren't good enough or the 90s legal system was too fucking corrupt, and I wasn't old enough to become an activist and social media hadn't been invented.  The settlement hasn't been enough to put all of us kids through college, I chose not to go so my little brothers could.  It's fucking with my head and my future.  Is there anything I can do to open this matter back up?  If anyone has any advice on how I can go about investigating this, or details I'd have to dig up beyond antiquated articles, please let me know.

(edit: clarity)

edit 2: I'd appreciate any alternate perspectives regarding statute of limitations and possibility of maneuvering outside of the decisions binding my mom, since I was a minor then and had no comprehension of anything up until relatively recently.

edit 3: Anyone know any software-entrepreneur-therapists? /s"

443,[UPDATE] Ex GF has belongings and refuses to give them back. Can I get a LEO involved?,"Update to my last post. First of all, I want to thank everyone to chimed in with their advice. I did end up having to get the law involved and though she did end up giving the firearm back once she realized they were coming, she still refused to give back my belongings. She states that she will give back the belongings (~$1200 worth) once I get her name off my vehicle... which she is a cosigner. The LEO played along and told me that im getting the better end of the deal, 20k to 1200... and I was like, wtf? Since the firearm was returned, it turned into a civil matter and nothing the LEO could do but to mediate. Anyway, I have everything documented and a case number so I can take her to small claims court and file for replevin. With that and the case number, I can claim that I attempted to get her to return my belongings and she refused. 

TL;DR: Called the police, firearm returned before they arrived. Still no belongings so filing for replevin."
444,I was assaulted on the operating table - Legal action yes or no?,"I live in Australia and want to see your thoughts on my potential claim for medical negligence/malpractice.

I gave birth to my Son in January of 2019 via csection. After receiving my epidural and while having my catheter inserted I started to feel sick and while my partner entered the operating theatre I begain to panic asking if they could please sit me up (the worst panic attack I have ever experienced) The anaesthetist told me to 'snap out of it' and grabbed at my cheeks and slapped me in the face until I was sedated seconds later. My partner was immediately removed from the theatre. I woke up in a state of panic. I came from a DV relationship prior to meeting my partner and father of my children and this took me back to that time. I never saw the anaesthetist again nor got an apology for her physically grabbing my face (I guess assaulting me) while I was unable to move. 

Months later I ended up with a mental health team and a perinatal psychiatrist and has diagnosed and medicated me for a variety of mental health issues including complrs PTSD which is likely to be life long. 

I had my third child 16mths laters and ended up with the head anaesthetist with me throughout the birth along with my Aboriginal health care worker and partner. I reluctantly went to my pre-anesthetics appts with alot of anxiety and hatred for the surgical team at the hospital and trying to refuse another csection. I told her what happened and she told me to 'do what I have to do' when I threatened bluffed legal action. 

I guess what im trying to say is, would I have a case for medical malpractice? Is it worth it? I just want to move on and forget it ever happened but yet every now again again I have flashbacks and it makes me feel so helpless. I cant even recall the week following the birth of my son. Its like that time has disappeared. It terrifies me to even seek care at hospital thinking I will be treated the same if I panic for a procedure. I dont feel like myself anymore and I feel sad my vibrant outgoing personality is gone...."
445,Food poisoning ended up giving me a hole in my esophagus,"So I’ve had food poisoning from Taco Bell three separate times. You’d think I’d learned from my second time, but when you haven’t eaten in twelve hours  and that’s all that’s around, had to eat it. 
Fast forward to the next morning: 4am violent vomiting and non stop diarrhea until 8:30am. Used google to Check symptoms and sure enough, what I had read told me to go to the ER. 
I get to the ER they do blood work and hook me up to an IV for water. Results came back as a high white cell count.
With this new info, I have to go and do a cat scan and they end up finding tears in my esophagus. 
I’ve been in the hospital now for three days, possibly another three, and transferred to the proper surgeon I would need. 
My insurance just ran out as I turned 26 in June. 
I am from California, but this happened to me in Las Vegas Nevada.

What I’m trying to get at is if i could sue Taco Bell. The doctors diagnosed me with food poisoning but then the extra exams found the tears. These tears would not have existed if I hadn’t been poisoned

446,Use of the N-word by white vs black employees.,"Texas

I am a white guy working at a restaurant where work environment is pretty irreverent. Drug use, sexual themes, underage drinking, etc are all frequent topics, as is the common use of the N-word, especially among kitchen staff. In a debate with a coworker today regarding the use of the word as an epithet vs a term of endearment. I posited that either the word was offensive and no one should use it, or it was a term of endearment and anyone could use it. My point was that a different standard should not be applied based on race. She, a black woman, said that she was allowed to use it but I was not. I said, ""I have the right to say anything that you do. Nigga. There, I just said it"". The coworker complained, and I was sent home. I am facing possible termination over this, despite the words frequent usage among black and Hispanic staff members. I would like to know if this constitutes discrimination, as a different standard applies to employees of different races. It was obviously poor judgement, and I have literally never said it before, but she got under my skin. Ironic how quickly a hypothetical debate became a reality.


Also, I know Texas is an at-will employment state, however I have a right to arbitration through the company per my employee handbook. Company based in Colorado/Tennessee, if that matters.

Thanks for your time, sorry if this is a stupid question. "
447,"(Ohio)is it illegal for my ""boyfriend"" to force religion on me?","Hey everyone, 

So I'm new here and could use some advice. 
 Basically my boyfriend is controlling in general, but when it comes to religion, he is extremely controlling. 

I'm a Christian, and he is Jewish. He hasn't converted yet, but lives and poses as a Jew. We have alot of the same beliefs due to attending the same church for some time. We have Known each other for 8 years. Been together pretty much that whole time. 

Within these past 6 months I've struggled terribly was depression and I've changed a lot, some of which is for the better. My views on religion and practices have changed a bit as well. He's never heard me out on this, and has shut down every conversation in relation to it, and refuses to discuss it. 

So I'm curious, is there any laws in regards to forcing religion on a spouse? or boyfriend/ girlfriend? 

By forcing me, I mean if I don't do exactly what he wants, he starts calling me a bitch, amongst other things. He doesn't see it as, me making my own decisions, he sees it as me being ""difficult."" I'm pretty sure, I have the right to make my own decisions.  He gets visibly angry and agitated, and will talk non-stop about the situation. 

Thank you. 


Edit: Wanted to let you all know that I left him. Life is so much better. I'm dealing with depression and fear but I'm free and so greatful to be out of that toxicity. I seriously could not see how bad it was, I'm happy to be free."
448,I want to get sued,"So my best friend and I have started a comedy podcast and we are averaging around 100 listens per episode. 
We think we have a real shot at doing something like this for a living and we both want to pursue it until it reaches fruition.

I had the (in my opinion, not his) brilliant idea to get sued by a big company because they say there is no such thing as bad publicity. My idea is 
-Say something on the podcast to get sued 
-Get sued by a big name company
-Get into news headlines
-Get listens on our podcast because of the publicity

What I want to know is
-How can we can get sued without ruining our financial lives
-What’s the worst that could happen, legitimately
We are in Indiana, USA

450,Fired from job for being angry. Co-worker touched me sexually,"So I'd like to get some advice on what has happened to me today and a few weeks ago.

&#x200B;

Today I got fired for my job for threatening a co-worker. I told him I was going to kick his ass. I was mostly joking. However a few weeks ago he sucked on his finger and got it wet with saliva and poked my butthole with his finger intentionally. I made it clear to him that I did not like being touched and if he did again I was going to kick his ass. I don't encounter this co-worker every day. However a few times afterwards he continued to make threatening motions to try and touch me over and over again. Each time I shoved him away and stupidly threatened to kick his ass. I did not hit him though. Only enough to back off and get away from him.

&#x200B;

So now I have no job. I would like to know what I should do about this. Should I contact the police and press sexual assault charges? I didn't get a chance to tell my employer my side of the story I was forced out.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any advice on what the best thing I could do is, I would really appreciate it."
451,Did the cops illegally detain me and were they negligent while doing so?,"Colorado laws shall apply here. 3 cops showed up on my door issuing me a harassment ticket. They were asking for my information in order to fill out the ticket. They asked for my phone number and I simply said ""I don't need to provide you with this information. It's public info I'm sure you can find but I'm not going to provide it."" 

They immediately put me in cuffs and walked me to the car.  They did ask if anything was in my pockets before placing me in the car which I know is correct, but once I was in the car I was able to take the hand cuffs off with ease. I tapped on the window and kept asking the officer stupid questions. Just mainly to get his attention to the fact that I wasn't hand cuffed. 

After they ran my information and were about to uncuff me I made sure my hands were in front of me and I said "" you didn't do well I took the cuffs off.""

""We weren't worried about you"" was their response 

I feel like this was negligence on Their part and they weren't following standard protocol, nor do I believe I should have even been detained for not providing my phone number. 

Was I in the wrong? Were they in the wrong? Can I possibly get my whole charge thrown out because of their negligence?"
452,Detained at a Texas Walmart for shoplifting while going to grab a cart without ever leaving the store.,"So this happened yesterday morning on my day off when my sister (28F) and I (20F) went to our nearby Walmart in San Antonio for a short shopping trip. We had brought with us those tote bags for shopping because we did not want all of the plastic ones at checkout. She brought a Walmart one, and I brought one from sprouts. We continue throughout the store, stopping at various places of interest where we deliberate over products before putting them in our tote bags. 
When we finally decide to grab the groceries, we realize we had run out of space in our bags and needed a cart to carry the milk. I volunteer to grab the cart and realize on my way there that Walmart is separating the exits and entrances due to COVID so I decide to leave on the exit side, get into that middle section with the carts (before you go outside), grab a cart, and continue back into the store. 
This was my plan however security didn't see it that way and stopped me right as I passed the sensor (which would have alerted me of what I was doing anyway). I did not get close to the sliding entrance doors as the sensors are several feet before them.  The first thing I tried to explain to the head of security was that I just went to get a cart, but she insisted that I had to go with her into the side room. Once there she instructed me to take the items out of my bag and when I asked if I was being detained she said yes. I continued to explain myself and tried to get her to realize this was just a misunderstanding as I had only gone to go grab a cart but she was convinced that once I passed the 'last point of sale' that I was shoplifting. All the while, my sister is frantic looking everywhere for me in the store as I failed to return with the cart.
The security lady kept me in there for 2 hours roughly, going over the footage of me (she showed me the video) and asking me questions. She showed me how she had been watching me and my sister since we came into the store. As we watch, I point out that there is no attempt to hide or conceal any of the products as I just put them in my shopping bag but she had stopped listening to me at this point. She even admitted to questioning her decision when she called her ""big boss"" (her words) for his input on the situation. After talking with him outside they decided to go through with the charge and SAPD shows up, the officer cuffs me and tells me to show up to court in a month. 
The total amount 'stolen' as recorded on my citation was $31.03 and was a spring mix of spinach, a white bandana for my hair, and some crocheting items my sister had picked up. I complied with security, all Walmart representatives, and the police, and though I got emotional when I was handcuffed I was in no way aggressive. IMO, the security lady seriously jumped the gun on detaining me and having me arrested when there was a reasonable explanation for this. Is this as ridiculous as I think it is?? I've never been in trouble with the law, I'm just a student and I'm really scared."
453,How can it be legal for a hotel or youth hostel to deny a minor accommodation if that minor has no other place to go?,"Hello and sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post to but I'm very lost and clueless in this. I am an Australian of 17 years of age that is moving to France for university. Uni starts in September so I have a lot of time to kill and travel. I am currently in France. However almost all establishments I go to (including youth hostels and Airbnb) refuse me accommodation. Yesterday I had to sleep in a bloody forest because of this and will do this tonight as well. How can it be legal for them to do this? How is this not considered child endangerment or something of the sort? I usually lie about my age to avoid this which works when the establishment isn't ""fancy"" and doesn't bother with my age. I get that the laws regarding this exist in order to protect the hotel/youth hostel from issues regarding liability and whatever but by refusing me they are putting me in danger. Also once again sorry but I have no idea where to ask for help but here. Also I'm not looking for help I'm actually pretty happy sleeping in the forest aside from the cunt load of bugs and future accommodation will not be as hard as this, I just had a lot of problems happen over the last few days. Cheers."

455,A neighbor left my daughters unsupervised for three hours. Can I press criminal charges or file a civil suit against them?,"My wife had an agreement with a neighbor down the street that they would alternate days picking up both family's kids from school.  Today was the neighbor's day to pick up.   My wife was three hours away on business and I was out of town.  My wife received a phone call from my daughters saying that no one was there to get them.  My wife called the neighbor and asked where she was.  Neighbor says her son didn't go to school today so she didn't have to pick up our daughters.  My wife explains she is three hours away and needs her to go get them.  The lady says her son has a baseball game that she can't miss.  My wife was unable to find someone else to help, so drove back to get the kids.  They were alone outside the school for three hours.  My wife told the woman she was irresponsible and she blew her off and told my wife she was overreacting.  Seeing as there are common human trafficking kidnappings of preteen girls in the area (Columbus, Georgia), both my wife and I did not think so.

Is what the neighbor did illegal?  We had an agreement, and evidence of the agreement is present in my wife's text messages.  Can I press criminal charges or file a criminal suit?

458,[Cali] I'm thinking about buying and eating industrial Lithium Carbonate. Is that legal?,"I have bipolar disorder and it is being [treated with Lithium Carbonate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))
[Lithium Carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_carbonate) is also used in industry for things like ceramics and lithium-ion batteries. Pure Lithium reacts readily with many chemicals, including with those in the atmosphere. Because of this, Lithium is frequently sold and shipped as the stable Lithium Carbonate after being mined. 
The point is that industrial Lithium Carbonate is readily available at many legit chemical distributors. The purity of the Lithium Carbonate that is sold varies but it is easy to find Lithium Carbonate that is much more [pure than pharmaceutical grade Lithium Carbonate.](http://www.risonchem.com/product_detail/id/207.html)

If I buy industrial Lithium Carbonate in bulk then I can measure it myself and save thousands of $$$$ by cutting out the middle men (like the pharmacist). In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for Li-ion batteries is causing the price of Lithium Carbonate to increase year by year so buying industrial Lithium Carbonate in bulk now would allow me to lock in a price.

Giving out these self made capsules would be clearly illegal and I have NO intention of doing this. This Lithium Carbonate would be for my own consumption *only*. I have not tried ordering it but if while ordering it I'm asked why I want it then of course, I would not tell them that I plan on eating it (would this cause me any legal trouble?).

So is it legal for me to buy and eat industrial Lithium Carbonate? Or would it then suddenly magically turn into a medication and somehow violate the law?

Edit: Got my answer. It's not illegal. Thanks everyone."

460,Stopped by plough drivers at Pike's Peak for reckless driving. Park Rangers said I am going to receive a summons for reckless driving.,"On Saturday I was driving at Pike's Peak, when two men operating a plough told me that my driving was unsafe and that I should leave. I had not done anything to warrant this, though my car is loud and does ""look"" quick. 

They had stopped to watch me round a corner, probably as I had my girlfriend film my car while I did so, (Pike's peak is on my bucket list and I wanted a video of me in my car there). I did not see any problem with what I was doing and drove around the corner as normal.

They drove up to my girlfriend immediately afterward and said ""you're not safe, you're leaving"". I thought this was in reference to the filming, and we obliged and made to leave the park.

When I got to the bottom of the tolled road, I was stopped by park rangers who requested my license and told me that I would be issued with a summons for reckless driving. I did not believe I had done anything wrong, and handed over my license as requested.

Upon researching this, it appears to be quite a serious offense that could result in jail time, and I believe this would almost certainly impact my visa. (Irish citizen working under an O-1A).

It is my belief that I did not act recklessly or even carelessly, and that no proof exists or could exist of this other than the two witnesses in the plough, and a park ranger who claims to have witnessed me ""peel out"" from a stop sign near the top of the peak. (Worth noting that my car is incapable of ""peeling out,"" as claimed).

What should I do here? Given the potential severity of the situation I feel getting a lawyer is prudent, but at the same time I was not stopped by an officer, nor was I doing anything wrong. 

If anyone has any direction here, it would be much appreciated."

464,I repeated office gossip in a goodbye email to my coworkers.,"This last week I left a manager job that I'd had for about 18 months at a small retail business. I wasn't fired, I got a new job and put in my two weeks notice. My boss wasn't the greatest. She was angry a lot, and easily frustrated when training new employees. She was always gossiping about them to me, and some of the stuff she said about them was pretty nasty. For instance, she said that one employee was too fat to wear leggings to work, and that another employee was wearing tops that were too low cut and that her chest looked gross. Then the business got a weird review online, and the boss thinks that one of the employees wrote it. She told me this!

So after I left my last day at work, I sent some emails to the other girls telling them what the boss had said about them, and yes, some of the things they said about each other. I know that repeating office gossip is a little dirty, but it felt really good to vent and get it all out. Well they all told the boss! 

So the boss called me and left a voicemail telling me how disappointed I was, and that I shouldn't use her as a reference anymore because I betrayed my post as manager or something, and that if I continued to email the other employees about the business she would get her lawyer involved. She sued a former employee once before, I don't know for what, but she pretty much ruined that persons life. 

Can I actually get in legal trouble for this?
Can she rescind the really good reference she gave me for the new job I just got? Can she call them up and take it back?

**Edit** 

You guys are dicks. I was just trying to be an honest person and to warn my coworkers about what a poisonous person our boss was. Now I might pay the price for doing the right thing and trying to help others. Wow, I could lose my new job that has amazing benefits and pays very well, all because my boss loved to gossip viciously about others. How is that fair? And you all think it's so funny because youre pathetic pieces of shit who love to watch people who are better than you fall on hard times. "

467,"Seeking advice, before I lawyer up, on what to do about being put on child support.","Location: TEXAS

Seeking legal advice...
This is my throwaway account. My main is my username for everything, so I don’t want it being linked back to me, and would like it very much if a face couldn’t be put to the stuff I’m about to type.

The mother of my child wants to put me on child support. The case is still pending.
I don’t want to be put on child support.
I want my daughter to live with us equally (alternating four days of the week every other week), and the cost be cut in half. I don’t want to help the mother with her rent or anything. I just want to make sure my daughter is well taken care of.
Should I get a lawyer? The lawyer I want to go with is asking for money even for advice. Would it be a waste of time and money since 90% of the time the mother always win.

Things I have on her that could help me.
-She has let my daughter get lice for months on end over the last three years. She waits until the last minute to do something about it. Always! She thinks that the over the counter stuff works, but she only buys it once they get really bad.
-She’s always sick while with her. I know little kids get sick a lot. It’s mostly always strep throat or an ear infection.
-On top of the lice thing on her hair, she developed a fungus on hair (which is now gone), but the doctor told her that it was most likely from being dirty, and not bathing. She would not bathe her because she rather her go to sleep or she’s too tired.
-She has an one bedroom apartment. I have a three bedroom house that she will have her own room in.
They share a bed over there. My daughter needs space.

Now the more complex stuff I hate talking about.
-I have videos of us fighting where she gets physical, and starts swinging at me. In the videos you can hear me asking her to stop.
-When we would fight and I would just need space away from her; she would go as far as showing up to my job. One time she showed up with our daughter unbuckled in the backseat. We had to argue outside my job, and I told her to just go home, she sped off causing my daughter to fly backwards in the back of the car. I texted her and told her that I was going to call the cops and told her what she had done because I was worried about my daughter. She texted back “It wasn’t that fast.” “She didn’t hurt herself. She’s okay.”
-I wasn’t always the best boyfriend. I let the stress of making ends meet get to me, and started neglecting her, and she ended up cheating. For two years we tried getting over it. I just couldn’t.
-I have pictures of the scratches she would leave on me after a fight we had because she was tired of me “not being able to see her” and the effort she’s putting into fixing the fact that she cheated.
-I got pictures and videos of her breaking stuff outside my house just because I wouldn’t let her inside my home for stuff that belonged to her. She also has stuff of mine that she doesn’t want to return. I’m willing to give her all her stuff back, but I need my stuff as well.
-Before the separation. We shared my current home. She would apply for store credit cards, max them out, and let the bills to collections. That just shows she’s terrible with finances. So I have a stack pile of letters from banks and debt collectors trying to collect what is due to them.
-She’s a shop lifter or was. I don’t know if she still does it, but she’s been caught three times at Walmart while being with our daughter. She’s lucky that they didn’t call CPS on her. She would text me that she was caught and she’s really nervous, and whatever one feels when they’ve been caught in deep shit. So I only have text messages of her saying she’s been caught with dates and time stamps, so perhaps I could go to that Walmart and ask for a copy of that footage from that date.
There’s more, but you guys get my point. I don’t want my daughter developing such toxic habits like her mother.
Should I go for full custody and be the one to put her on child support or should I just bite the bullet and take it up bum like most men who are put on child support?
Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks."
468,Parents want to kick me out without notice and are threatening to call the police and lie if I don't leave,"I'm 19. My parents want to kick me out. They haven't given me notice which I'm sure they need to give me notice before they kick me out. I told them this and they don't care. 

My mom says she will call the police if I don't leave. She will tell them that I'm using drugs. That's not true. I wasn't using any drugs until today and she found small amounts of Coke and heroin and drug paraphernalia that she says she will show the police as proof so I'll get arrested for drugs. 

I'm high right now in case that matters so if she calls the police, I'm gonna still be high. I'm not obviously high or fucked up. 

Can the police arrest me for the drugs my mom says that I did even if I'm not obviously high? And what do I do if the police show up and my mom starts lying about me saying I'm violent or stealing from the house? Would I be arrested for things she claims I'm doing because there's no proof I actually did anything she says I did. The reason I ask is because I fell and cut my head in the process and so she might say I was fighting because I look it. 

Also I have money that I made in my bank account that my parents won't hand over even though it's mine and obviously I can't complain to the police because then my mom will just say I'm lying or high and they'll believe her. 

And also, if I leave and my parents call the police anyway, would they look for me? "

470,"Maryland- my POS ex-girlfriend is taking advantage of the Red Flag Law, and she’s trying to claim my “alcoholism” is making me suicidal.","I’m a college aged man, and as a young and dumb adult, I merely didn’t know my limits when I had a night of drinking. I passed out and somebody called the ambulance because they thought I was showing signs of acute alcohol poisoning at a house party. The reality is that I sleep like a rock, even when I’m sober. It was just that I happened to barf because I also got dared to chug a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi, which made the vomit look concerning. 

My girlfriend hears about this, she comes home from university, about an hour away, and she immediately starts telling the doctors and nurses that she “always knew my alcoholism would make me suicidal!” 

I immediately tell her to shut her mouthy a** up, and try and explain that I simply didn’t know my limits, and there’s no evidence to suggest that I’m suicidal. Doesn’t stop her, she then starts mouthing off about how I might shoot myself out of impulse. 

I always wanted to break up with her, but didn’t have the heart to do so, but this particular day was different. See, she’s a POS because she cannot accept the fact that I don’t want to smoke weed with her. She tries to push it on me constantly, which has put a damper on our relationship. She also handles stress terribly by turning on her close friends, and she’s a thief. Additionally, we don’t see eye to eye with gun ownership. 

Anyways, she said she’s going to be seeking the protective order that takes an owner’s guns before due process. I lose my cool, and I tell she needs to get the F out of my life, and that I don’t want to ever see her again. She was taken back by those comments, and she asked if I was for real, and I said yes. 

I even brought up all the crap she’s pulled, the stealing of fundraiser money, the pressing weed on me all the time, the temper she has when she’s stressed, etc. I told her that I was done with her. She refuses to leave the hospital room. 

I tell her to get the hell out, she still doesn’t want to leave, I poured the now cold shepherd’s pie down her bra, and tell her to get the hell out of my hospital room. She runs off in tears and embarrassment. 

I check out of the hospital after spending 6 hours of my life there. We go to today, I get a knock on the door, and the police officers explain to me that the judge has indeed granted the protective order, and that I need to hand over my firearms. 

I ask for a moment to consult with my attorney, I ask for advice, he tells me to itemize all the firearms by taking pictures of everything the police grab. Building off that, I didn’t tell the police anything, and yes they missed many firearms. 

One’s cached underground, and they missed a couple hunting rifles. 

Of the things they took, it included stuff that I wasn’t aware was fair game with these horrible laws such as my compound and crossbows. My muzzleloader, hunting rifles, etc. 

I then tried reaching out to the county attorney, and she basically told me that “people’s lives are more important than your guns, and your hunting” when asked how I would defend myself without a gun, she rudely says “use a baseball bat!” And hangs up on me. 

So where do I really go from here? Do I get my attorney on this thing? 

Oh yea, I’m being charged for the pie incident, but that chick promised to drop the charges if I apologize and hook back up with her..."

472,Awful AirBnb Trip. Evicted out of the house with 7 kids under the age of 4 for having to many people in a hot tub and staying int he hot tub 7 minutes longer than allowed.,"The title sums it up. My family and friends were staying in State College, PA over the weekend for the Blue and White weekend. We got to the AirBnB rental property at 10pm on Friday night. We stayed the night, went to the game the next day and came home around 6pm. We then played with the kids in the back yard, ate dinner, put the kids to bed, and retired to the patio and hot tub for the night. We were drinking, a couple of us got in the hot tub, definitely too many, but not unsafe. I own a hot tub so I did not consider this misuse. Well at about 10:05 the host game out from behind some bushes and started screaming at us, telling us we were being too loud, it was past curfew, and we were miss using the hot tub. He said we had to get out of the house right away and the cops had been called. He was screaming at us to get out and actually screamed at my 3-year-old daughter. The Cops came and when they arrived, they actually said they thought they were at the wrong house because it was too quite. We explained the situation to the police and they pleaded with the guy not to kick us out. We apologized and said we would go inside and head to bed as we had seven children sleeping in the house. He would not take no for an answer and had the police forcibly remove us. He showed the cops a video a video of us from the surveillance system (is that legal to film us?). The cops said they had never seen anything like this, but they had to ask us to leave. It was very traumatizing, especially to the kids and my autistic sister (who was crying throughout the whole thing). We eventually got everyone up and out of the house, which took us until midnight, and had to drive 2 hours to one of my friend’s house to stay. We called the police this morning and the Sargent was very nice. He complimented us on how we handled the situation and even mentioned the guy tried to charge us with a noise violation and public disturbance. The Police called a district judge to see if they could do that and the judge told them, we were doing nothing wrong. This cop even apologized for having to do it, and said they would not have handled that as well as we did. He said we literally got kicked out of the house for having to many people in the hot tub, and being in the hot tub for 7 minutes to long (the police call from him came in at 10:07pm. Anyway, I reported the issue to AirBnB and I requested a full refund. This guy was a true asshole. Is there anything else legally I need to do or should do? I think this guy is dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to be on AirBnB and should have consequences for what he did. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: 
House Rules


No smoking


Not suitable for pets


No parties or events (this was not a party)


Check in is anytime after 2PM

Residence is in a Quiet Residential Neighborhood. No parties allowed and noise ordinances 
are in affect after 7pm. (Cops said there is no noise ordinances and when the pulled up they did not hear anything. We did not recieve a noise violation even though the guy wanted us charged with it)


We apologize that our Hot Tub & Patio
area must be vacated by 10 pm. (Didn't even get the chance to because the guy scared us out)
out of respect to the neighbors. (no neighbors complained per the cop)


Video Surveillance on exterior of property.


Non-compliance with this rule will result in loss of security deposit & or Possible immediate eviction of the property.

Edit: Grammar\Spelling


Edit: To Further Paint the picture.  There was no party.  At it's peak we had 11 total people outside on the deck relaxing, 6 of those in the hot tub, and a kid sleeping.  We are all over the age of 35 except the kids.  The guy showed up at 9:57pm and called the cops at 10:07pm per the police report.   At this point there where 7 adults outside and 4 in the tub.  We were actually wrapping up before he jumped out on us as my brother and his wife had already gone inside, and another couple was already in bed.  My dad, who is 68, walked around the house to make sure we where not being to loud at 9:15pm.  I don't think we broke any rules at this point, as there was no max limit on the hottub set and he jumped out on us before we had a chance to vacate the outside.  Also, no need to send me parenting advice.  Looking for legal advice, which I did get some good responses on.  Thanks to /u/antmadison for pointing out they are not supposed to kick us out.  They are supposed to contact AirBnB to resolve the problem.  Thanks for the support and help!!

Edit:  All 11 adults where staying at the house.  The house sleeps 15 per the posting.  No one not staying at the house was ever at the house.  The kids where in Pack N' Plays and little cots.

Edit:  Everyone staying in the house was registered to stay in the house.  The owner was there when we all checked in on Friday."
473,UPDATE: Some guys and me in my school got in trouble for touching girls. Can we legally get in big trouble? (update),"So today was my first day back at school. We actually just finished spring break but my suspension was three days before the break started (so basically extra three days of break xD). 

Anyways the principal called my parents and I into the office. Apparently its a little worse than I thought. It wasn't just one girl that reported us. It was like 5 or 6. We aren't allowed to know the names (confidentiality and privacy duh). The principal told us what we did was very serious and that a lot of guys got in trouble for it (more than 6 actually, a lot more got in trouble, I thought it was just 6 but I think atleast 10 guys got in trouble). He told us that this behavior, if continued, would involve the police. He also told us that the girls' parents could potentially report us to the authorities.

The principal did tell us that the school did not tell the girls' parents the names of the perpetrators (again because of privacy and school policy).

My parents were pretty mad at me too. They took away a lot of my game/phone privelages and Im actually typing this from my moms laptop on incognito mode. My dad took away my allowance too and said Im not allowed to go out with my friends for a few months.

Now Im trying to figure out how to apologize to the girls. I wont do this shit ever again for sure. I didnt realize how much it could hurt people and thought we were just fooling around. On top of that, what type of brother am I being to my sister? And as the older guys in the school, what type of example are we setting? I dont want my sister to go through this in 7/8th grade. 

So anyways I plan on apologizing to all the girls in person. I thought about doing a letter but thats a written confession and not good for legal stuff. It shouldnt be too hard. Im friends with most, if not all, of them and I do talk to them quite often. Ill apologize to them and help them out if they ever need anything. Also I wont hang out with my friends who did this either. I think they are also remorseful and are facing punishments from their parents too. Im not going to blame peer pressure either, I did this, nobody forced me to do anything.

As for legal trouble, I think I will be fine. Maybe not but we'll see I guess.

thanks for the advice and lessons in my original post."
474,My job is retroactively firing me and withholding pay.,"I'm in Arkansas.  My job contract was through June 20 and I'm a salaried employee with biweekly pay.  I had to leave the state early May 31st to move to a new job, medical residency, that begins July 1st.  So from May 31st until now I have been out of state and not present in clinic which is 2 days a week and is my only job responsibility now.  They do not rely on me at the clinic and don't miss me while I'm gone.  In fact, no one knows when I'm supposed to be there aside from my boss.  I know I should have had a conversation with my employer but no one knew I was gone until I confessed, over phone, to my boss when she emailed asking for my keys.  I'm wondering if I'm entitled to those two weeks of pay because I was not fired before now. Can I retroactively be fired and pay withheld?  Some things to add, I had to leave on May 31st and couldn't leave later.  I regret it but I was trying to be sneaky and get paid for those extra weeks as I desperately need money and I knew no one would miss me."
475,"[NY] Serial rapist just got an order of protection against me for telling people he's a serial rapist. Only confirmed victim won't come forward. Order of protection says ""no third party contact."" What can I still do?","I introduced this dirtbag to two of my friends and he coerced one of them into sex multiple times, seriously traumatizing her, probably the other one as well, and who knows how many others. 

I've been spreading the word and he came to my house yesterday saying he was going to take me to court for slander. I was very excited to watch him either confess (he thinks what he did wasn't rape so he might) or perjure himself while getting increasingly frustrated that the court won't just trust his word.

I'm very disappointed he's going after me for harassment instead. The definition of harassment seems really stupid to me at this point, I don't understand how he was able to do this instead of slander. It seems like it completely changes the game, right? I know he'd fuck himself over in a slander case, but with this I'm not so sure. Am I wrong about that somehow?

First thing that's happened so far is I was just brought to the local court for an order of protection. It's just the usual, but this is the most concerning part:

>  Specify other conditions defendant must observe for the purposes of protection: NO THIRD PARTY CONTACT

The judge told me this meant I can no longer talk to people about him. I literally can't have any communication with anyone regarding him. This doesn't make sense to me, as I've had an order of protection against me before (I totally deserved that one though - mental breakdown, said some horrible shit) and from what I understand, third-party contact is just that, having a third party make contact for you. How can it prevent me from sharing information? It seems to me like the judge was just bullshitting because everyone in the justice system seems to be a pathological liar when it comes to grey areas. It probably just makes his job easier. Honestly, I don't give a fuck how easy his job is, while I'm trying to stop this kid from hurting anyone else. 

So what are my real legal limits? Can I actually still contact people and tell them what I know as long as I'm not asking them to contact him or anything? What if others contact me about him, can I answer their questions? I'm prepared to deal with whatever amount of hassle it takes. I'm not afraid of jail time while the case plays out, either. I do not give a shit what hardships I have to go through for the sake of this endeavor, as long as I can prevail in the end legally. So don't give me the advice that makes things easiest, give me the legal truth.

As an aside - this is a much more important question, but I have to relegate it to footnote status because it's so much less likely to get answered - is there any fucking way I can get him to charge me with slander? It's such bullshit that this is being done through harassment laws, it shouldn't be possible. Can I appeal to get my charge altered? Like seriously, is there any (legal) action I could take that might trigger a slander charge? Or is this going to play out differently than I thought and there's just as much room for him to fuck himself over in this case as there would be with slander? "
476,Impersonated on Facebook to the point of being arrested (almost Swatted) 3 times! Facebook/Police not helping and I'm scared for my life. #Swatting,"This is absolutely madness: I am in desperate need of a good advice. I am scared for my life. This is a ""throwaway"" account for obvious reasons. This is all about throwaway accounts ironically. **If your going to comment please read thoroughly and understand all the dynamics involved, not looking for hundreds of comments telling me to report the account or things like that, that won't help.** 

Last year I was dating a girl for several months, at the end we had a miscommunication about what she wanted and she became pregnant. It was one of this issues that we split up over and in the heat of moment she believed she needed a Protection From Abuse order. I allowed a default judgement to happen because I did not want to fight with her in court at all, I was too sad. There was no actual abuse ever in our relationship outside of disagreements, not verbal, physical or otherwise. She simply had raised hormones and really did not like some of my opinions on that matter but it was not abuse. I talked to people about the breakup and abortion to grieve and may have made a post about how sad I was to have an abortion.

Roughly 6 months went by and everything was fine until one day I get a call from a police officer explaining they have an arrest warrant for me for harassing my ex on Facebook before even asking me any questions, claiming they had tried to call earlier but I never received any missed calls. He tells me that the profile name is (lets say for story purposes) Jason(not my name, not even close) and that Jason has been threatening my ex. I explain to him that this is impossible because I have her blocked on my Facebook account, and agree to be cooperative and allow him to do whatever they need to prove it was not me, but that it was definitely not me. I was certain they would rescind a warrant or have to if give it a second look given new evidence proving it wasn't me. I know you usually are not supposed to answer any questions but I was and am genuinely interested in finding who really did this and in protecting anyone from this person or these types of actions by anyone to anyone.  The police's logic up to that point was absolutely unhinged so I thought any kind of logic would help.

Upon getting the police reports months later they are saying the person simply said that yes they were me when asked by my ex if it was me. They also are saying it is me because the person mentioned the pregnancy and her and I were the only ones that could possibly know about that (6 months later, after I had vented to many about it in a healthy way and after she could have told anyone) or talk the way the ""Jason"" talked to her.

I was arrested none the less, I had unsecured bail that time, but immediately I began to become completely afraid and victimized. No one had advice for me to protect myself from further arrests and that stress has not stopped to this day to the point it is getting very problematic for my mental and physical health even though the arrests have finally stopped (after a 2nd and 3rd), I'm traumatized. I am starting to see a doctor but do not have insurance so that makes this all more stressful to the point where I have really never felt lower in my life or more afraid. The stress makes it hard to mount the kind of courage I need to take this on. It's a real shame that I have a support team and am still feeling defeated. I hate to think about the weak ones in our society.

Weeks later at the arraignment I was told I was being arrested again for the very same thing, again without being talked to. Again the same profile. My worst fear that they would keep doing it had came true and no one had or has any answers to this day. Bail was secured and we decided to pay the whole thing which was thousands of dollars.

Whoever impersonated me (or still is) is definitely getting the best of me. I thank anyone who is reading because it's been hard to vent on social media due to the sensitive nature and I tend to cry very badly if I talk about the way I REALLY feel in person so this is the first time I've been able to tell a fuller side of the story to anyone outside my family and a couple close friends but even than I try be brave to not stress them even though I am terrified. I'm worried my lawyer won't have me testify and I'll be railroaded and never heard, locked up and have the key thrown away for something I didn't do and given a ""life sentence"" of harassment from this person to get me in trouble whenever they want.

I have a good lawyer and I have confidence in him but there's so much more at stake here than just my criminal defense and I saw that from the start. That's why I'm here is to find a lawyer that feels passionately or specializes in civil rights. No one should ever be arrested for such flimsy evidence, Facebook should be giving them information to actually catch the person, or someone higher up in cyber crime should be involved to do WHATEVER needed to really catch this person as red handed as possible. Bottom line is the police are not doing their job and this is a common problem between me and my ex. Facebook is not doing their job catch ""Jason"" SO FAR and it's been over 7 months or longer.

AND it didn't end there! Months later I was contacted again by the police as the impersonator was harassing her again. But this time they didn't have an arrest warrant yet and I had an air tight alibi under cameras and without my phone so they did not arrest me.

2 days later the same police department arrested me again without calling, without looking into the events 2 days prior, simply based on the links to the account based on the previous arrests. This time ""Jason"" said used an escalated threat and a new charge was added. I believe they were trying to Swat me. Bail was through the roof this time, nearly $10k cash. None of the police officers were educated in what Swatting is. I don't know who gets bailed out over and over again and pays cash bail just to do something they know they would get arrested for again, it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. Its been hell on my family. Before I left the police station I went up and asked the front desk for help as my fear was setting into full blown panic of going home just to be arrested again. They had no answers. My criminal lawyer helped the arrests stop after that but I have no idea whether or not the actual harassment has stopped other than to guess because they have not told me about arresting anyone else for it; meaning that the person is still free to do it, and I'm not sure what would make them stop.

I have tried to avoid thinking about who exactly it could be ""Jason"" so I don't go crazy but I thought about the motivations.  They either don't like me, or her, or both, and there are all sorts of people who could fit that description and also know about our situation and details about our lives in the 6 months between the break up and the incident.

I need all the help I can get. I'm scared. I want the person responsible caught and brought to justice. I wonder if the only way to do that is with a good civil rights lawyer who perhaps has dealt with a similar case, Swatting, or with Facebook I have ways to borrow money to pay whatever but it is straining me and adding to the stress and victimization. I really think that I have a strong case to win some money for having my rights violated like this. When I did a search here on Reddit I'm not the only one who has incurred loses from someone impersonating them on Facebook. I want to make sure this doesn't happen again and the person is caught but if I should be compensated I want to know if that's something that I should start now. If I should do anything to get this in the public eye and court of public opinion or anything to prevent it from happening to anyone in my state or in the country again I want to know. Any advice at all is appreciated. Not looking for information on a specific lawyer here as that's for another thread but rather if that's something people do now. Thank you for your time. It feels great to get this out and I'm sure I will have some great advice soon.  Your helping a man who feels completely broken. Your helping my ex who is a single mom with a son get justice. Your helping my family and anyone else affected. But mainly your helping everyone and that's what this thread is about, not specific advice or my defense but more so generally how this affects the legal system, everyone, me, etc.

P.S. and putting up with any grammar or rule errors as I'm stressed thinking about this and it's late. I will proof read and fix anything needed asap, please bring it to my attention if I have done something wrong here, I initially didn't realize I had to go somewhere else for specific lawyer recommendations.

Thank you all. Spread Love and Peace.

Sincerely,"

I work nights, and sleep during the day.  I ordered a pizza from a pizza place as soon as they opened at 10 AM.  The pizza was not delivered by noon, so i gave up and went to bed... Two hours later I was awoken by the police knocking on my bedroom door, inside my house.  Apparently the pizza place called the police because they ""thought something was wrong""  but i suspect that in reality they were just getting petty revenge for me not answering the door because I was asleep.  I should add that the food was paid for, as i had given them my credit card over the phone.  

&#x200B;

The police opened my (unlocked) garage door from the outside, and then opened my (unlocked) door that went into the garage, and woke me up by knocking on my bedroom door inside my house.

&#x200B;

Were these officers operating under the letter of the law?  Furthermore is there anything I can do about this pizza place wasting the polices time and harassing customers?

478,(Georgia) My brother was shot twice in an Uber. No health insurance.,"Hi Everyone,

I appreciate all replies in advance.  This happened over a year ago and I have yet to find any options that help the situation.  I should have posted here sooner.

My brother and his lady friend were getting in an uber behind some local bars when 4 men approached the car with guns drawn.  They were tapping on the windows and demanding the people in the car give away valuables.  The driver hit the gas and the men started shooting.  My brother jumped on the girl and took two bullets.  The uber driver drove him straight to the hospital.  

My brother didn't have health insurance. Yes, I get that probably wasn't the best decision on his part. Through all surgeries and medical complications he accumulated over $100k in medical debt.  

Uber did nothing through all of this.  They were slow to get back to him and offered very little condolence or options.  My brother has given up on his debt and it has basically tanked his future financial stability.  Luckily he is alive, healthy, and well.  

Is Uber not liable to offer some sort of recompense if a rider is hurt or attacked? If not, isn't this a bigger problem?

Edit: I get that Uber wasn't at fault.  Maybe my post was poorly worded.  I guess I should have asked how does Uber not have some sort of insurance for their riders in case something bad happens.      "

The person who asked me is asking for his friend. He says he has known him for years, a great guy, and he needs to stay here so he can keep sending money back to his country for his family.

Questions

1. What are the concerns I should have if I do this, and if there are ways to prevent them, what are they?

2. Is 20k a good price for doing something like this?

3. If you marry someone in the country, are you able to get divorced, and if you do get divorced, are they able to stay? Is there a certain amount of time you’ll be able to get divorced? 

I have more but I’ll start there. If there’s any more advice you think I should here please let me know. I have a lot of time to consider it. Thank you so much."
483,"Brother was abusive last night, I left the home to go to my sister’s place for safety only to have her husband attempt to drug me and try to sexually coerce me. (Maryland)","Reddit, my family is fucking garbage.

The parents are out of town for a funeral, my brother at some point got very drunk and lost his dab pen. He accused me of stealing it and proceeded to do up to $5,000 of damage to the home, eventually found it but refused to leave and physically attacked me during an argument.

I went to the commissioners office for a protection order and to filed forms for being the victim of second degree assault. 

I get done there, go to my sister’s home for refuge as I had no where else to go and the police were really pushing that I should leave for my safety.

My sister is out of town, but my nephew and his father were supposed to be there. Around 6am I ring their doorbell and my BIL (brother-in-law) answers. I explained what was going on and he said I could stay. My nephew was apparently staying at a friend’s home that night.
However when we go outside to smoke a cigarette he offers me weed and a rolling paper. I def need to unwind. However he then started telling me he wanted to see me shirtless. I put out the joint, smoking maybe 1/3 of it. He offered me shots of crown royal and I decline. He proceeded to talk about sex and how it’s a stress release, I try to steer the convo in some other direction. He asks me if I’m tired, offers me a shower and “his side of the bed”. I’m really tired and traumatized already so I move to another room, honestly trying to sober up ASAP to leave. He enters the room I’m in, gives me this weird hug where he basically caressed half my body and planted some open mouthed kisses on my face then mentions he’ll be getting naked in the other room and to join him and I decline. 

While my head was racing about what had happened, the police called me asking permission to enter the home where my brother was, they eventually call back to tell me he’s been told to vacate and that his dog was not secured (the sliding glass door shattered so the dog was able to escape) so I had to go back and deal with that. I swiftly left my sister’s place, still high, glad to leave. 

I don’t even know what to tell my sister, I’m going to wait for her to get back from vacation before I tell her what happened. Her husband had an affair earlier in the year so she was on the fence with the decision to divorce him. Telling her this news that her husband tried to take advantage of me while I was vulnerable will most definitely trigger the divorce if she doesn’t fucking murder him first.

I stayed pretty silent so her husband doesn’t know how upset I am. I know he owns firearms too so I’m a bit fearful of retaliation. Idk what I should do, should I fill another protection order?  What do I do?"
484,Can you snitch out of a DUI?,"My friend crashed his car drunk, was taken to the hospital, but was able to leave the following morning. He has since had nothing happen to him. His reasoning for nothing happening to him was first that, “the officer in charge is on vacation,” and now that he’s, “waiting for blood tests.”  The accident was over a month ago now.

Is it possible he snitched and didn’t get any charges? I don’t want to jump to conclusions but this all sounds unbelievable. Especially if you take into consideration that he has evaded serious charges in the past with similarly suspicious reasoning.

this took place in IA if that’s relevant"
485,Pregnancy Discrimination,"My wife works for a county is Wisconsin.  We have 2 children.  During each of her pregnancies, she asked for light-duty but was told ""there was none available"".  She ended up burning through her leave and had to take an unpaid leave of absence for both pregnancies.  

&#x200B;

Relevant facts:  Several others were given light duty assignments before and after my wife's leave.  In one case, a male was given light duty while my wife was off.

My wife went unpaid for a several months due to medical restrictions enacted by her doctor.

I believe she is out significant income and time towards retirement due to their lack of accommodation.

Pregnant women in the past have been reassigned to another area of the agency that would fall within their medical restrictions.

Men have been re-assigned to other departments when staffing was an issue.  I can show documentation of staffing shortages in the same department during the time she was denied light duty.  This would have fallen into her medical restrictions and has been done with others several times in the past.

She did file an FMLA request with HR and specifically wrote a request for light duty assignments.  I do not believe HR was involved in any of those decisions.

There is a part-time front office position that has ""hours as needed"".  I understand that this person continued to get hours during my wife's leave.  When asked about this, I understand the justification was that ""her hourly rate was higher than the part-timer"".  Pregnant women had been allowed to do this front office work in the past, however that's been 7 or 8 years.

My wife is prepared to leave employment here if we pursue this matter.  

We have both thought this was very wrong from the beginning.  She elected not to pursue anything in an attempt to ""be a team player"".      

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some questions:

1. This is super wrong, correct?
2. Doesn't a government agency have a duty to accommodate medical restrictions?  ie if there is work to do that falls within her medical restrictions, is their a duty to accommodate?  or can they just say ""we don't have anything available""?
3. I understand her employer to be the county, not the specific county agency.  Therefore, shouldn't they have sought light-duty work in other departments of the county?, (before completely denying her).  
4. I understand there are time limits for filing a complaint.  She is outside the window from when she was last denied, however, as they are currently allowing others to have light duty, desn't the clock re-set as males are freely being given light duty but she wasn't?
5. Does it pay to address any of this with HR, or just contact an attorney?

Thanks or any help / advice.

I think this is mostly about making sure others don't go through the same things we did.

486,"Discovered I was transgender 8 months into marriage, and 16 months into marriage we are divorcing mutually. In laws want to sue me for cost of the wedding. [TX]","I married my parter last year. 6 months in I went on antidepressants over some suicidal ideations. 2 months after that, and some research, I started to question some feelings I've had with me all my life but no therapist or counselor could ever identify. I went to see an LGBT specific therapist the week after I told her I was questioning my gender. She has loved and supported me the whole way. However after months of weekly therapy for me and couples counseling for us, we realize we cannot be happy as partners anymore and want to separate non-contested. So we can stay friends,which is really about how we turned out in the end. I filed 3 days ago. She submitted her waiver of service (or notice? I'm not in a very clear head rn) yesterday, fully notarized. She informed her parents. Initially they just talked plans of moving her back to their town.

They called again today saying they contacted a lawyer on my partners behalf about the situation and are trying to force her to sue me based on the grounds of it being a ""fraudulent marriage"". The entire cost of the wedding. She is forced to live with them when she goes back. I suspect they are going to threaten her with homelessness if she doesn't sue me. She has a job but no place to stay down there other than their house.

They want either a check of my savings, of which there's none, or to sue me for everything I'm worth. Which, again, isn't more than a few hundred. Since therapy and counseling and bills for 8 months means I'm living almost paycheck to paycheck.

We never combined finances. Never owned property. Everything was pretty much bought and owned seperately and we agreed to keep things as is in the paperwork. 

When I started therapy I didn't know I was trans. I was questioning. About 3 months of weekly therapy I figured out I  really was fully trans. I started hormones about 3 or 4 months after that. I still see this therapist and they definitely still have my file. 

The MiL is very manipulative and abusive. They are also very conservative and anti-trans. I believe they simply want to sue me to hurt me. And given my ex's history with her, I believe she will go through with it despite her not wanting to.

I'm not really sure what to do right now. I'm very scared."
487,"I want to voluntarily surrender my parental rights to a child I have never met and basically already have no legal rights to aside from paying child support. (Colorado, USA)","I (35 M) had a 10 day ""relationship"" with a Chilean woman (38). We communicated online for a few months before meeting in person. When we met her and I spent some time with her in person, I really really disliked her for many reasons.
 When she went back to Chile (after a 10 day visit with me in CO, USA) she was pregnant and now she is using this child to try and manipulate me into being in a relationship with her.
 She threatens me and my children from my marriage (I'm not married now and wasn't when the ""relationship"" occurred.) with violence, cyber bullying, legal action. She has threatened to kill herself if I don't go back with her, she sent me a picture of herself holding our child over a stair well and threatened to drop him if I didn't go back with her. She has threatened to jump off the building where she lives with our child if I won't go back with her, so many terrible things I won't recount them all. 
I have absolutely no legal recourse against what she is doing because I cannot engage in legal action in Chile. However, she can and has engaged in legal action against me, her in Colorado.
She opened a child support case with the county where I live in Feb of 2016, It took months to establish the case, paternity and everything else and then after 2 months of the child support order being in place, she is coming back after me for more money. She is using this as blackmail because I won't go back with her. I'm not assuming this is her motive, this is what she has told me many times. She knows that I can barely afford what I currently pay and that raising the amount will make things hard on me and my other children. That's the situation, my question is, can I voluntarily surrender my parental rights to this child and take away this little ""weapon"" (child support) that she is using against me? Does anyone have any helpful resources or a helpful direction to point me in? Thanks in advance. 
*EDIT* 
I am not actually trying to dodge paying support for this child. I am trying to take away the ability of this woman to pull me into courts and meetings with DHS and otherwise make my life (and my childrens lives) difficult. That is really my only goal. I already have no legal rights to this child, the situation is just her abusing, harassing, bullying and annoying me and my other children and because she lives in Chile, I cannot do anything about it. Taking away this child support case would be one small step to get her to back-off. 

TLDR: Got a Chilean woman pregnant and she uses the child support system to threaten me into a relationship with her. I want to simply surrender my parental rights to this child and disarm her. "
488,[WA] Considering suicide. No debts/back taxes. How can/should I divide my estate?,"I read the subreddit guidelines and did not see any rules against titles like these, but this is essentially the issue at hand.

I have zero outstanding debts but make monthly purchases such as rent and auto insurance.

490,"[RI, USA] Downstairs neighbor is grade-10 snore-er causing loss of sleep","Going to try to keep this simple and not vent/rant and thanking you all ahead of time if take time to read/respond.

We started our lease mid-September. About a week in, we started to notice our neighbor below us snores extremely loud. For the first month, we have been able to either go to sleep before the snoring begins, but it's getting to the point where either a) the snoring wakes both myself or my partner out of a dead sleep, or b) if we happen to wake up in the middle of the night, the snoring keeps us awake. This person also has erratic sleep patterns and the snoring can also be heard/felt in our other room (we only have two, and the kitchen) at any given point.

I've already done some cursory research and the outlook isn't great. If a person is snoring this hard, most of the time they have ZERO clue or are in denial or hide behind their health condition and cry disability. Add to this that most landlords/property managers don't have a single fuck to give because all they care about is collecting rent.

Well, myself and my partner both have registered disabilities of our own and lack of sleep SEVERELY aggravates those issues. My partner is on SSI/SSDI and despite my own issues I work 40 hrs/wk. and the lack of sleep is starting to unravel my life. The stress this is causing is a massive strain on our relationship as we are both are constantly stressed out and under-slept.

So, here is what I know so far as options are concerned and what kind of push-back I expect from the property co.:

-Earplugs: Don't work because this is a bass frequency; this is snoring you FEEL, not hear.

-White-noise: Tried this too, but in order to drown out the snoring, the white noise is also too loud to sleep through

-Carpet/padding/soundproofing: An undue burden as in order to sound-proof my floor (hardwoods) a carpet and padding would be well near $1,000 I just don't have to drop on a whim (and our rent is $910/mo.)

-Change rooms: The layout of the apartment and our furniture would make this impossible

-Move the bed: The snoring permeates the entire room

-Record it and talk to the neighbor: Due to the fact it's not a volume but a vibration noise, I can't afford equipment that will actually pick this up

-Sleep-aids: Another undue burden - we will NOT risk becoming dependent to hardcore medications or build up a resistance to melatonin or something like Zzzquil which we use RARELY/as-needed on nights when we can't sleep due to our disabilities and usually result in waking up feeling like you're hungover

Edit: Formatting.
I plan to try to talk to the neighbors, but the folks that live in the unit below us don't speak English very well and I fully expect them to act like they don't speak English at all if I try to approach them or leave them a letter. I've also internalized guilt for being angry because I know this person likely also has sleep apnea and is either breaking through their treatment, ignoring treatment or can't afford treatment (CPAP machines are EXPENSIVE).

At this point, we just don't know what to do. We can't afford to move and the kind of property owners we have, based on how they strict they are about ""late fees"" and the general condition of the building, we aren't expecting even a sliver of compassion or empathy. I would bet money they would NOT be interested in relocating us and I cannot afford the time/money to move again even if they offer a different unit.

The feeling of being stuck in this situation is really destroying our mental state. We moved to this side of town because it's nicer, quieter and has significantly less crime. We love this unit and the location and it's infuriating/depressing this is what we have come in to.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and if you happen to have any advice to share, thank you so, so, so, so much! Have an awesome day, r/legaladvice!



Edit: Every single comment I make on this post is getting downvoted almost instantly after posting. I have a feeling either a bot or a troll/s or someone who just doesn't want me talking about this has an ax to grind and is trying to sink my worthless internet points. Isn't that... uh... breaking some rules?



Edit numero dos: My comment karma just shot up 40 points... so, huh. Weird. Either someone got banned, or someone else actually went through and counter-voted the downvote bot/troll.

Anywho, just talked to the rental office folks: It appears that it is indeed a new tenant who moved in recently, hence why we didn't notice this day one.

The gentleman who rented the unit to this person is going to call them to give them a heads up and see if they can open up a dialog with him. They also advised that I contact the occupancy manager via email to open a dialog there as well. They told me that if it does indeed get bad enough and there is a tenable unit of similar price/size/condition/location the likelihood of having to pay the transfer fee would be incredibly low and we would only be on the hook for our own moving expenses. Thankfully, all the units are in a relatively close proximity to eachother, so hopefully, if things come to pass as such, we do have options.

So, to all who genuinely contributed, from a legal or personal prospective, thank you SO much, really. Your input, advice and kind words have made this quite a bit easier to process and brainstorm around.

And to all the trolls, name-callers and those who pandered antagonism I only have this to say: I'm sorry your life is so miserable you feel the need to take it out on other people. I hope you get the help you need and maybe a hug or two sometime soon.

Edit # 3: and my comment karma just dropped 60-points. Sweet. Getting closer and closer to my negative karma bucket-list goal. Man, must have REALLY rustled some jimmies for people to sift through the entire thread (and possibly my post history) just to downvote everything.

Final Edit: thanks again to all who have contributed. I now have a LOT more to work with and a much better outlook on the situation as a whole. I appreciate you time and really can't thank some of you enough for the trully valuable feedback.

And a final note to the downboat brigade: If you guys just make two more throwaway accounts and downvote the whole thread again, I'll finally be at negative comment karma! It's a dream come true! THANK YOU SO MUCH LE REDDIT for showing, yet again, that internet points are srs bizness that you'd take the such precious time out of your life to go through my entire comment history just to downvote me because reasons I guess.



... oh, and hello, SRD. Thanks for breaking your own rules and brigading not only this thread, but my account as a whole. Top notch work you folks are doing over there."
491,Is there anything that I as a breadwinner can do to protect my assets before getting married?,"I currently enjoy a high paying job and an excellent career. I put alot of money into investments and live below my means. I am single now but I am hoping to one day get married and have children and then pass the investments onto them so that they can live off the interest 50 years from now. It is possible my descendants won't have to work again for many generations if I am smart in my lifetime.

However, this could all fall apart if I were to get divorced. I have seen so many people, men and women, absolutely destroyed during a divorce and lose everything they have taken twenty or thirty years to build. 

I have a stable life and I want to only increase that, not add undo risk into the equation.

My question is, what options do I have to prevent a divorce where I lose everything? Are there any options besides simply not getting married in the first place?

For example, Could I get surrogate mothers and then date my whole life? Could I put the index funds into an LLC that can't be touched in a divorce? Could I sign agreements for full child custody before ever having a child with anyone I am dating? 

Are there any solutions available to lower my risk?

492,"I have three children at home. 40% of my money is going to my ex for my fourth child, even he has money, which he used to hire a lawyer to get 100% custody (based on lies). I have a hearing tomorrow!","**Alaska.**

Posting for a friend. A friend who is a doormat. A friend who is broke. A single mom raising three children.

She's worked a low-level job for years, (though she's gotten promoted), just for one reason: to prove she can keep a job. All for her fourth child.

Her ex has full custody of her fourth child. He got custody because he has money, and used that money to hire a lawyer. Together, they told the judge she was a drug addict/using drugs, and the judge believed them, and awarded him full custody. (I'm sure they said more, but I don't have all the details, and this was the *main* thing.) She was caught off guard, *did NOT have a lawyer,* and was dumbfounded by the accusations. Seriously, she clammed up in shock and surprise. She says she was cut off when she finally tried to respond, and never got to rebut the accusations.

(**Edit:** she also was apparently convicted of a crime years ago in the past. Details are sparse, but she believed her kids were in physical danger, and used a vehicle that wasn't hers to flee. From what I've gathered, she didn't mount any legal defense, and thus she was convicted of theft.)

This was three years ago. Since then, he has been telling the child the reason she doesn't see her mommy that ""mommy doesn't want to see you.""

From what I've heard, he's a liar and a manipulator. And he uses drugs, at least one which was illegal until recently. She receives no child support. She has literally never used illegal drugs. She is actually a very kind, very patient, very loving, helpful, and dependable person. (I wouldn't say this about 80% of people I know, so I'm not just saying that.)

What can she say in court tomorrow to help reverse this decision?

496,Suspended from my job until further notice,"Hey law-versed folks of reddit, I need some help.

I work in Phoenix, and recently returned to the area yesterday after traveling for the holidays. Sunday 11/26/17 I took roughly 2 or 3mg of of (admittedly non-prescription) Xanax at ~7pm because I knew I wanted to get a full night of rest before work. I fell asleep around 11:30pm, and woke up the next morning at around 8:30 in the morning.

I drove to work just fine, but as I was pulling in my parking space I just barely clipped a car. Oops, my bad, I get it, I have to figure this out. The owner of the other car was nowhere to be found, but I was lucky enough that a security guard was close enough to notice. She asked if everything was fine, I said yeah, and she said she'd have to take pictures and call the police. No big deal. I just made the mistake of assuming she'd had it taken care of.

I go to work in my office, and about an hour later my manager comes up to me and says he has to talk to me. There's two officers waiting and they immediately ask me if I'm drunk or on drugs. They then sobriety test me with their flashlight which went fine (but I'm still fucking trembling do to the fact that I NEVER have run ins with the cops.) They then continue to have me walk in a straight line which I totally struggled with, I think due to the fear? I'm not sure, I really can do that at any time but I really couldn't do it right considering the situation.

They then arrest me and cite me with the following after taking a blood test:
> DUI - Impaired to the slightest degree

> DUI - Drugs

> False reporting to law enforcement

> Failure to leave required info

> Failure to control speed to avoid collision

Okay, so coming form someone with literally no experience with officers due to a complete lack of a criminal record I get that I shouldn't have told them shit. But I couldn't help it because I was intimidated by the situation, and allowed them to blood test me. I really don't know what's bound to happen to me because I'm now suspended from my job until the case is closed. I'm lost and know I handled it poorly.... Please please help me."
497,"(California) Slapped my girlfriend during a heated argument, neighbor recorded it but did not call police, what rights do I have?","I live in California. I got into a heated argument with my girlfriend one morning* and it was like an all day affair. Every time I said something, she would roll her eyes or bring up something I had done wrong in the past five years. At one point she stormed out of the apartment to take out the trash. I said something along the lines of let me get that for you and she freaked out(while inside the apartment) and started slapping my chest. I backed up and told her to please stop. She threw the garbage bag on the ground and started crying. I picked it up and went outside, she followed behind me screaming and hitting me in the back. I started to walk back and she continued hitting me and getting up in my face. I snapped and slapped her in the face. She finally stopped and became quiet. 


As we were walking back to our apartment, a man with a phone pointed at us was standing there recording us. He didn't even acknowledge we were there, just kept recording us. I told my girlfriend to enter the apartment and lock the door. She didn't say anything, but did it. I walked up to the guy, he wouldn't answer my questions. I told him that he needed to stop recording me in public like this because I have a right to privacy in public. He refused to speak. I grabbed the phone from him just to see what he had been recording, and he had me slapping my girlfriend, but not the events that led up to it. How screwed am I? How can I protect myself legally? This guy obviously has no intentions of calling the police as it has been several days and my weirdo neighbor has not said anything and no police has come to my front door.
