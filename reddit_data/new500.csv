1,Realistic fine amount for punching someone?,"Hi all, my boyfriend punched someone and they called the cops on him. The police showed up, and my boyfriend had already went home and they questioned me. I just told them the truth, that yeah he punched them but it wasn’t really that serious. The cops honestly seemed bored. They contacted my boyfriend and questioned him and my bf told the truth as well. They gave him a citation and said he’s going to be fined. My bf is currently freaking out over the fine and doesn’t know how much it’s going to be. He’s also saying he can face a year in jail. I honestly don’t think it’s that serious, considering the other guy isn’t pressing charges. What, realistically, will his fine be like?"
2,Cost share disagreement on driveway maintenance?,"I live in Oregon, and my house is on a shared driveway with one other house. The other property includes the driveway, and we have an easement built into the plat with instructions that maintenance is a shared expense. 

I don't have an issue with helping pay for or even providing the labor and equipment to maintain the gravel on the driveway. 
My neighbor has chosen to mail a bid to us from a local contractor that costs $1050.

 I priced out 5 tons of gravel from the local quarry and 5 gallons of diesel from a local gas station and sent her my estimate if we performed the work with the equipment we can borrow from a family member that includes a dump trailer, a tractor with a box blade and front end loader and a plate compactor. We have experience with this equipment helping this family member with their own driveway and other mud abatement projects. My total estimate came to $126.35, of which I told her if she paid half, we'd be good.
She has instead chosen to stay with her original estimate from the contractor. That's fine, it's her property,  but I have an issue with being expected to pay at least half of his quote when we could do the same job for 10x less.
We wrote her a letter expressing our concerns with the cost and followed up with a text but she's not communicating with us. I think she is going to do what she did last time which was have the work done with no input from us and tape the bill to our door.
My next step will be to inform her in writing that my maximum reimbursement towards the work done will be the total of my estimate if we did the work.
I know she'll probably threaten small claims on us. If she does, how much of a leg would we have to stand on? I looked over the Oregon statute on shared maintenance but I don't see mention of how much each party is supposed to contribute."
3,"Seller didn't disclose termites, Inspector negligently missed them... do we have any recourse? [NJ]","We are new homeowners, and dealing with a nightmare lemon-house (purchased from out of state)... please help me figure out if we have any recourse with this particular issue. If not, this may financially ruin us.

* Seller indicated ""no"" on disclosure form to history of termites, and ""no"" to a history of contracts with pest control companies for termites. We hired an inspector (who offered an add-on termite inspection), and he didn't note anything wrong with the property. There is an active infestation in the foundation and  throughout the house. 3 separate opinions noted any competent inspector should have seen the issues. (I didn't know what to look for during final walkthrough, never grew up where termites were widespread).
* I called a few local termite treatment companies. One of the big companies said that they have an account at our address, under the seller's name. There are also a few knocked-down mud tubes on the property. We were told this is a standard procedure after treatment (so you can tell if they return). It looks like the Seller failed to disclose termites (or at least, having had a contract with the company, which was on the disclosure form).

Could the seller liable for some of the repairs we will need? (it is extensive unfortunately). Our contract did say something about advising buyers hire a professional exterminator to inspect for termites prior to closing (we unfortunately trusted our inspector as competent). Does that advise disqualify the seller from liability?

4,"Passing of father, no executor. Understanding beneficiaries.","Hey all, just a little confused, unfortunately my father passed away last week and had nothing to his name.

However I got him a job last year and there’s a small amount of vacation pay left over that will help with his funeral . I informed them of his passing but they would not pass along any information regarding a beneficiary. As I am acting as his next of kin are they not allowed to inform me? 


Is there a route I can go to find this information out? 

Would appreciate any help or clarification.

5,Possible eviction. What's my window for repayment to avoid being evicted?,"Case is on the 27th. I am certain I can repay all the due rent before the day but if I am a little short, would I still have time AFTER the hearing to submit a payment to avoid the eviction?"
6,Can I write scathing opinion pieces about the education industry without being sued for everything I own?,"Thanks in advance for any advice --- I'm seeking information on creating an anonymous blog and what I need to potentially be careful about in a legal sense.

I want to create a rant-style blog in which I bring up huge issues in a certain industry - education. I have the background knowledge and experience to do this knowledgeably. I'm going to avoid naming specific groups when I can, but there is the possibility that I go after bigger groups and established 'brand names' in education like Lucy Calkins and McGraw Hill. There's a lot of bullshit that needs to be called out. I don't plan on naming or calling out any individual school districts, but it's possible that one could come up.

My questions are as follows:

1. If I publish anonymously, what advice do you have when it comes to maintaining utter online anonymity?
2. What is the possibility or chance that a McGraw-Hill and Lucy Calkins would litigate if I criticized them? I don't plan on making any outlandish claims - just strong critiques of their negative impacts on educational trends. Should I be worried about lawsuits when it comes to critiquing big names in education industries? There's also a possibility that certain individual players could be named (shady CEOs or boards), but it's unlikely to be common.
3. Would an LLC be a good idea for this venture? If lawsuits are potentially a fact of life in this type of endeavor, should I form an LLC to ensure that my personal assets are protected? Would an LLC require me to give up my plans for anonymity?
4. Are there other options besides forming an LLC to protect or help a one-person anonymous blog/social media set-up?"
7,Question about hernia mesh lawsuit in California:,"My daughter who is now 20 yrs old, had a mesh hernia surgery done when she was like 10 or 11. After it was done, she had pain and she had to go back to get surgery done again to correct. 10 years later, and she still has discomfort. I'm seeing these advertisements for mesh lawsuits, but there's so many. Is there one legit place we can call? Is it even worth it?"
8,Am I a victim of insurance fraud?,"Hello guys,

I live in Ohio and back in December 2022 I got a new car insurance company. I was able to get a Non-Ownership policy for $66 a month which included the SR-22 Bond which I am required to hold due to being pulled over and not being able to produce proper insurance (long story short, and biggest lesson I can teach y'all, PAY FOR YOUR CAR INSURANCE!! It's not worth the legal hassles of not having a policy). So $66 was a deal. Well today (it's now April 2023) I went to pay my insurance and since I moved to another city, update my address. We attempted the address change and after I gave her my address she tells me that the new price is $91. Hold up, the new price? What do you mean the new price? We have a contract stating my monthly payments are $66. She informs me that your insurance price is based on where you live. So I look at my previous policy card I got and my address is in a whole nother city. Also might I add, upon Google Mapping the address they had on file, it doesn't even exist.  That's when I get really concerned because I'm a drug felon who's changed his life and is trying to get his rights restored so I can fully protect myself and my family, so I know the legal system a little. I get concerned because now since I know that 1. Insurance price is based on where you live and 2. My address they been had on file was wrong, am I going to fall victim of insurance fraud. So now I feel like I'm in a dilemma where if I don't change my address and make a payment I knowingly commit insurance fraud at this point, or I change my address and pay the $91 and continue my relationship with a company that knowingly commits insurance fraud further putting my legal safety at risk, or do I just go ahead and cut ties with this company and maybe pursue some kind of legal action.  Well to let y'all know, I did the 3rd one. I cut ties. I informed the CSR to cancel my policy due to the fraudulent activity happening with this company. So now I guess my question is this, since I had to cancel my policy I now don't have a valid Driver's License and my professions all require a Driver's License, can I sue the insurance company for damages lost due to not being able to work because they was commiting fraud under my name?  I'll reiterate what I said before, I did not know insurance price was based on where I lived so I definitely gave him the address I was residing at in that current time. I'm also temporarily disabled due to a PCL injury and what little money I did have was so I can still drive myself to my appointments. Which now I can't do. And the little bit of money I have won't cover the start of a new policy so this has greatly effected my quality of life. What should I do lawyers of Reddit. Please help. 


Also big plus if any attorney can help me with an Aflac case on what I think is a bad faith claim."
9,Visible by Verizon sold me stolen iPhone!!!,"Hello, all. So, this is a new one for me. In January, I purchased an iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB thru Visible (financed with Affirm on Visible's checkout page). I paid $429.73 immediately with Amex as a down payment and the rest l've been paying monthly. Already having a phone, I never activated it and it's still brand new in the box. I ran the IMEI when I got it and it was clean. I ran it again yesterday when I intended to port out of Visible.  Guess what! It's been reported stolen by AT&T Mobility.

I learned from Verizon (not Visible) that the number assigned to me by Visible originated from Cingular.  Beyond that, I am unaware of any connection with AT&T, and still cannot fathom a scenario in which this could occur. Other than some back and forth in Visible chat and in Twitter DMs, I am getting nowhere, although I've been informed my case has been escalated. Has anyone experienced any of this nonsense before?

Also, now I have two phones I cannot sell, the ""stolen"" one and another iPhone 14 Pro Max I purchased directly from Apple (as it is tied to my Visible number now, I can't terminate service and maintain account access with Visible). I've copied every single thing from their website in case I lose access anyway, but haven't cancelled yet in case I need to chat with them again.

Currently, I've communicated with Visible only. I suppose next, I need to inform Affirm and Amex, if for nothing else than to make them aware.

Does anyone here in Tampa have any recommendations for an attorney specializing in corporate fraud cases??

Also, would now be a good time to contact the Tampa PD and file a report with them too??

Thanks!

I originally posted this in r/tampa and hopefully it’s allowed that I post it here, too."
10,NEED HELP!! Contractor refuses to continue work and has taken materials ordered for our project,"We hired a contractor to build a gable patio for us in the backyard. The contractor had originally quoted us 4 weeks to finish this project. We have a contract, which outlines a payment schedule by time. Such as week 1 an X amount will be paid, Week 2 X amount will be paid (I know this was our mistake, we should have done by the work done instead) . The first week things were slow, demolition took way longer then it should have. The contractor assured us that thing will pick up. Second was the same as well, yet we adhered to the payment schedule.  By the end of week 3, ~ 70% of the work was done. But the rest still remained. But there was no change as week 4 concluded, and he asked for money so we told him we won't be releasing any money as there no progress from the previous week. After a long and heated discussion we ended up give him the check. At this point,  we have given 92% of the amount agreeed upon by bother parties and the last 8% was to be delieved upon finishing the project. The week later he came back and asked for more money. We refused as its not in the contract we signed. And he came back with change orders, (changes that we supposedly made to the scope of work). Most of the items were already in the scope of work disscussed and signed by him and I. So we refused them as well. He then took the marterial for our project  and refuses to give it back. The dudes an 80 year old man, who is kinda racist ( we are immigrants).  I just want to know what I can do. He refuses to meet, our original idea was to have him sign an agreement where we release the remaining 8% of the money in parts after certain things of the project are completed. To the best of our knowledge, we have not breached the contract. Would love some help in this manner. He keeps threatening liens on us if we don't pay. We live in Texas btw."
11,Seeking advice,"Hi all. I am looking for some legal representation, if appropriate. I have been a resident of my complex for almost 7 years (I rent, most own). It is mostly elderly and retired people that live here. Randomly I received a call from a manager that we no longer have access to the clubhouse and pool due to a neighbor complaining that the club house bathroom smelled like marijuana and the video footage was reviewed and my 15-year-old daughter and her boyfriend had both used the bathroom, separately. I drug tested my daughter, negative for THC, told them she is an ""a"" student that has never touched drugs, but they stated, ""too many other things had happened"". I was sure there was a misunderstanding so I wrote an appeal letter requesting reconsideration, notified them that the drug test was negative, and my daughter had footage on her cell phone with no behavior that would be considered against the club house/pool rules. They replied with a letter claiming over the years that there has been damage to pool table, burns on the table, ornaments missing from the tree, and other issues. These are all new accusations without any merit, proof, no police reports, or notification to our unit to date. They haven't' been able to walk the dog without someone telling them that they need to clean up after themselves, which they have never done anything but be respectful and responsible. They are the only children, living among the elderly, and sometimes just their presence is enough to annoy the residents. We were also told in the past that my oldest daughter's boyfriend needed to be walked up to the unit, no other teenagers, just him as he made the lady residents ""uncomfortable"". He is black and young. My youngest daughter's boyfriend is also black, and he had been in the club house a total of 2 times the day we were kicked out for life. Is this something that should be handled through a lawyer? I have 14 more months on my lease."
12,"I'm suing Ebay, small claims, any pointers?","I bought an item for nearly $500. The item got to my post office and the package was returned to the seller. We just bought and moved into this house, I've received  FedEx, UPS and Amazon,  but ohhh no, not the US Mail! The return of this item is not really a big deal to me, what IS, are the tracking details, loss of money and loss of time.

The tracking clearly shows the package being shipped, arriving to my post office, noted Insufficient Address and you can see it traveling allll the way back to the dirt bag seller. It's scanned at the sellers post office....AND THEN, for whatever reason, says ""Delivered front porch"" with MY TOWN, not his!!!!

The seller is his own kind of d-bag, instead of canceling the order so I get my money back and he gets reimbursed for shipping so we can then do the whole transaction over again...this guy tells Ebay he shipped it and keeps my money and keeps his item! It's all there clear as day in our messages. He acknowledges having the item and demands I pay more shipping! Ha, I'm not paying another DIME. Cancel the order!!

This is where I quit talking to the seller and kindly ask Ebay for my money back as I never received the item. Ebay takes one lazy look at the tracking, that does indeed say ""Delivered, ..my porch"" and says they show it Delivered, please check with my neighbors or behind the bushes. OMFG. Any normal human could objectively look at the tracking and see the ""delivered"" part didn't happen. A giant package can't go from California to Colorado in four hours!! On top of that, I have messages from the seller detailing his possession of the item. They did not care. I appealed the case, they closed it citing the tracking stating it was delivered!!

Ok, fine, I'll go to my bank. Chase gave me my money back....for a month, then took it back saying they communicated with Ebay and Ebay says its a legitimate sale. Chase wont help you. I even appealed to their escalations team who after reviewing FOURTEEN PAGES of documented evidence said ""its been too long"". RIDICULOUS.

I am absolutely furious. My wife and I closed all of our Chase accounts and moved to a credit union. After 23 years of Ebay I'm never going back and I wanna sue their pants off..or at least get what's mine. 

Anybody been here before? As far as I know, all I have to do is go down to my court house, fill out the paper work and pay a fee.

Edit: forgot to mention I have detailed tracking showing and a letter from the postmaster stating it was never delivered to me."
13,Scammed in Philippines,"Admittedly, i fucked up this time. Last night I matched with a girl on tinder, and we agreed to meet. I did ask if she was a prostitute, or charged in anyway, and she said no. we went to her hotel room, and mid way her friend walked in, and she joined in without saying more than hey whats up. After the deed was done they then demanded 60,000 philippino pesos, saying their friend was a hooker. Of course I only had 3000, so they walked me to an ATM, where 4 of their friends joined and made sure I didn't try anything.
They even threatened to call the police on ME.
I know, I'm an idiot, but I want to know, what should I do now, what should I have done, and cani actually get in trouble here? PS yes I'm an American traveling abroad.

Tldr:got scammed big time by hooker I thought was into me"
14,Employer falsely accusing me of neglect and abuse of senior citizens - no evidence,"I worked at an assisted living for three months, and at the end of my three month probationary period my boss accused me of the following:
- yelling and screaming at residents 
- unlawfully restraining them 
- lying on incidence reports after a resident got a head injury
- refusing to clean them 

I am willing to swear in front of a Bible that I didn’t do these things. They have no evidence at all just gossip from employees who refuse to act as witnesses. My employer is threatening to fire me and put a mark in my record, and also has access to my social security and banking information. 

I don’t know what to do. My boss won’t act reasonable and won’t believe me that I didn’t do these things."
15,I bought a pickup and never changed the title into my name,So I bought my pickup about 3.5 years ago and when the old owners sold it to me they signed the release of liability and gave me the title and release of liability. I put it in a file somewhere and lost it for a couple years I couldn’t remember where I put it and looked “everywhere” for it.

16,Unresponsive immigration lawyers,"I am based in San Diego but our immigration lawyers office is based in New York. We signed up with our lawyers in June 2022. In January of 2023 I provided all the documents for my EB2-NIW to get started on case prep. In late Feb 2023 our lawyer informed us they are ready to file our case. We paid the remaining lawyer fees and filing fees. It now mid April our case has not been filed. We have reached out to get an update and a timeline but they are now unresponsive. I could not get a hold anyone on any of the phone numbers provided. My next step is to write a formal letter and send it with receipt demanding reasons they haven't been responding to us. If they do not resond I will terminate our contract and demand a refund. Their retainer fee was 3000 and we have paid another 5000 for case prep. Realistically how much of that money could we hope to get back? 

Also if they don't return my case documents and money, does filing a complaint with the bar association work?"

18,Preliminary Notice of Mechanics Lien,"Just received a letter in the mail saying that it's a Preliminary Notice for furnishing equipment, labor, materials or service.   


It says that the work/materials furnished started in Late November 2022. It lists my address as the jobsite and an original contractor, who is not the company filing the lien. We're in New York State.   


The thing is: we never had work done by this contractor? Not any that we agreed to, at least. At one point, a company was working on the sidewalks of my entire road around that time period, but we assumed they were with the utilities company.   


How do we address this?"

This includes text, social media, location, calls, photos, internet history and what apps we use. This is not on a company phone but our own personal phone. 

On top of this we are not only being monitored during our shift but were told that the app will continue monitoring while we are not at work. This seems like it is violating ethic codes. What are my options?"
20,How would I go about protecting myself legally if I want to sell plant seeds and/or props for potentially dangerous plants?,"Context: I'm a horticultural hobbyist and I'm considering selling seeds, props, maybe seedlings, ect to earn a little money from my hobby. My problem here is that I tend to grow more unusual or exotic plants for my area including potentially dangerous plants. I am especially worried about the plants that can give you a high (IE I grow a few varieties of datura, which is particularly notorious). 

Is there anything I can or should do to protect myself from any legal repercussions should a theoretical customer either purposely or accidentally injure themself or another (or get high, as someone could probably claim me to be a dealer)?

I am in Michigan, USA. Thanks in advance

21,Ex roommate,"I know this probably isn’t relevant on this forum 

But I need some advice. My husband and I are so stressed out about this I’m trying to keep peace and handle the situation. 

Long story short we just had a so called roommate move out Thursday. Broke the lease 6 months in, less than 2 weeks notice. She told my husband she’d pay the utilities and clean the next day. Last night she got all upset and texted my husband asking why everyone was being rude to her. When… 

Our other roommate has never spoken to her. She ignored him. She hates me and has never given me a reason why (everything was great the first two months, we were even friends before and her and husband used to work together the last year.) she is causing so much unnecessary drama it’s affecting all of us and we believe she’s doing it on purpose. I don’t know if I should contact my landlord and let him know what’s going on. If I’m being honest he never really liked her, she kept texting and emailing him about problems with the sink/toilet/lights when we’ve had the plumber come more than 4x to check and everything was fine. I’ve even done some handy work down there. He was upset she broke the lease halfway. 

I want her to pay her half (she did rent) get the rest of her stuff, leave the keys(she made copies and gave em out no joke) and leave. That’s it but she’s pitching a fit. This woman has a masters, works full time, holds so much hatred and grudges it’s uncomfortable (even our friends could feel the tension coming into our home). This isn’t fair, I wrote out a message that I’m gonna send Monday. I told my husband to block her number for now. Are we in the wrong here? Please any advice would be greatly appreciated."
22,Excessive Force?,I was arrested at my residence for traffic ticket warrants and while being escorted out of my home in handcufs my dog lunged at the officer thinking I was in danger. My dog did not bite the officer but came very close to he then told me “you better get your dog before I shoot it” I then replied “your not gonna shoot my dog your in her yard”. I then yelled at my dog to get away wich she did the officer then jerked me to continue walking toward the end of the driveway. He then jerked me again at which point I told him “chill out” and before I new it he legged swept me from the front causing me to land straight on my head. Being that i was handcuffed i could not brace my fall and ended up being knocked unconscious from the fall. My question is  Can i sue the police officer for excessive force or would his actions be justified under law? my security cameras captured the whole encounter.
23,"160k in debt, no promised license yet, can I sue?","I graduated last year from a nonprofit private university with $160,000 of private loan debt for a music teaching degree. Please don't comment on the poor reasoning here- it's beside the point and I’ve learned my lesson. This degree promised to equip me with all the requirements to obtain a teaching license. After graduating, the school reached out with the following:

""Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that the instructor who taught you the required reading standards did not meet the new faculty qualifications under a recent state rule that was passed. Because of this, we now need you to complete an additional course with a qualified reading instructor before we can submit your license materials to the proper licensure association."" They covered the course for me. 

I completed the class and still haven't gotten my license yet this year as the teacher still hasn't put in final grades for the course (and the course was a total joke, it took me roughly two hours to complete (all online) and the professor took 2+ months respond to any request). Obviously, I was declined from all teaching jobs I applied to during this time while I didn't have a license. I've taken a job in a childcare, just trying to make ends meet right now. This put my career on hold for a whole year, and I can’t get my deposit back from the licensing organization when I went to try and apply the first time back in July. Can I press charges against my university? Any other advice for what to do is appreciated."
24,"Terminating lease due to no hot water for almost 6 months. What are my rights, how do I go about ending my contract?","So middle of October 2022 I did not have hot water. A work order was submitted to the property and after I followed up they said the plumber was working on it. Fast forward to today, April 2023. I still do not have hot water. The property is well aware of the hot water issues and there are tons of other tenants who have left reviews on their website complaining, even the news interviewed a previous tenant regarding the hot water issues. I am at a point where I need to get out of this lease, I cannot take it anymore. They closed my last work order (cancelled it ) regarding the hot water without following up with me to see if I had hot water. No plumber has been by my apartment since January to check. I have the option to “buy out” of my lease…but given the fact they aren’t holding up their end of the contract, I would like to end the contract without legal repercussions or paying the buy out fees. Is this something I legally have a right to do at this point? I am located in Oklahoma, which of course has almost 0 laws to protect tenants. But, hot water is a basic necessity so I need to know if I have a standing chance to get out of my lease legally."
25,What legal actions can I take against a landlord who ignored my special accommodation request?,"I live in a project based section 8 apartment and requested a special accommodation for a live in aid to help me with my two special needs children. I submitted all the requested information as did their pediatrician and they confirmed receipt via email February 13th. I followed up with them multiple time over the following 4 weeks because she originally said it would take about 2 weeks. After the 4th week I just stopped asking. However, I really needed the aide and everything continued to go down hill. The state is working on finding emergency placement for kids no so I will no longer need the aide. Is this worth pursuing from a legal standpoint ?

Also, they made me pay about $400 for a stove that one of the kids broke. I’m scared to tell them about the rest of the damage they’ve caused to the apartment because I can’t afford to pay for the repairs. However, I recently read that we can’t be charged because of their disabilities. Is this true?"

27,"My son has started refusing to come over for visitation, and my ex is not following any of the court orders. What can i do?","I have an order of joint custody (im non-custodial) and a standard visitation order following oklahoma law. My son who is 7 has started refusing to come over and giving every excuse imaginable from ""i dont play with him"" to ""i ignore him"" which isn't true but his mother refuses to listen. Whenever asked to be more encouraging instead of simply saying ""you dont have to go if you dont want to"" she just replies that shes not forcing her autistic son to do something he doesnt want to. This also isnt the first time this has happened. After looking at it further she hasnt followed a single one of the courts orders, she always makes plans on my weekends with him and in the 4 years since the court order hes stayed the night a total of 4 times. I had to have myself added to his medical records by contacting the hospital and giving them the court order, and had to do the same for his old school. I dont even know what school he is in now and i certainly havnt been added to his contact list. 

&#x200B;

So are there any options or steps i can take before finding a lawyer and making it a full blown court battle? Ive tried contacting DHS already but they told me they dont handle that kind of issue."
28,Apartment won’t give my application deposit back,"My boyfriend and I applied for an apartment last November with a $750 application fee/holding deposit and were denied after waiting a whole month to hear back (we were fresh out of grad school and couldn’t provide pay stubs, we toured the place and they said offer letters from our jobs would be okay then went back on their word, but that’s beside the point). We were told we would get the deposit back within 4-6 weeks. 

We were about to start the process of moving out of the apartment we stayed in during grad school, and each of us went to our parents’ homes for the holidays. When we were rejected, I spoke with someone on the phone AND sent an email asking them to send our check to my parents’ address instead, knowing it would take forever. I have an email from them confirming they had received my email and would request the check be sent there. 

Well we never got the check back and obviously ended up moving into a different apartment building in the same area. I went in person back in January and was told they had sent the check to the old address, our graduate school apartment, despite their email confirmation that it would be sent to my parents’ address! They said they would cancel the original check and issue a new one, to expect it in 3-4 weeks. It’s been 3 months and nothing. We’ve tried calling, they never answer. Emailing, they never get back to us. Our work hours don’t align with their hours, so now that we’ve started our jobs it’s impossible to go in person. What are our options and what are the laws about this? We’re in New York if that matters."

30,Someone cancelled my insurance and my dog suddenly got sick,"I’ll try to keep this short, but basically I need some advice on who to talk to about this situation. 

I have pet insurance for my dog and he became very sick, so I logged into the insurance app and it said my account said it was cancelled. I was confused as I’ve never missed a payment. I called them and they said they got an email from my email canceling the account. There is no way someone accessed my account because Google tells you. There is also no sent email from my account. They said there was. 

I am waiting on the tests to come back to see if he was poisoned. I have no idea how this happened or who could have done it. Do I talk to the police? Should I find a lawyer? Should I try to contact the insurance again?

My dog is doing better now and I paid for vet bills out of pocket, which is fine. My main concern is that the insurance was cancelled and then he got sick within a week. I have gone through the list in my head and I can figure out who knew I had that insurance and also who would do this. I generally keep to myself and I don’t feel like I have anyone who would do this to me."

If I were to use, for example, the art from a card called Kuriboh as my profile picture on various platforms, would that be legal or is it protected by some copyright law? This is assuming it's strictly for personal use and no monetary gain.

Additional question. If I were to use that same art for my avatar on social media platforms that I am making money off, therefor it would in a way be used as my own marketing tool (I assume?), could I get in throuble then?

I remember years ago, a member of an e-sports organisation called Faze had to rebrand, because his name was ""Blaziken"" (also a name of a very popular Pokemon creature) and he therefor got in trouble with the makers of Pokémon."
35,Month to month lease regulations,"So I might post this on a few different subreddits, as I don't know where people migrate for these type of topics.

We have lived in our current apartment for almost 7 years. We haven't signed a lease in around 3 years so we have been month to month tenants, complied with every rent increase etc. 

We recently found a new place to move to and I applied 2 months out. The application process, finding out if we got approved, getting the lease etc took a while. We finally got the lease the first week of April and signed the week after (after reading it thoroughly). That new lease starts on 5/1. 

So we notified our current landlord that we were moving and he said he needs 60 days notice. Now my primary question is, how can he require a 60 day notice on a month to month lease? The whole point of a month to month is either landlord or tenant can terminate the agreement with 30 days notice. Now I looked it up and most states say 30 day notice for a month to month is law. We live in Michigan. 

Our landlord is saying that because expired lease from years ago says 60 days that we have to abide by that. I'm having a hard time understanding how Michigan law for month to month is 30 days notice but he's saying because the expired lease says 60 days that it's still 60 days. They can't both be true. One must trump the other. And as far as I'm aware, law trumps policy. Giving 60 days notice on a month to month lease is like giving 2 years notice on a year lease. It's nonsensical. 

Anyway, because we effectively only gave him 16 days notice, we thought that we could offer to stay till the end of May... which would be 47 days notice in total. We would just use the month of May to move slowly and have to eat the cost of 2 rent payments for the month. 

Is this reasonable? We have lived there for almost 7 years so its not like he can move someone in right after we vacate. He will need to renovate the place and do maintenance that he didn't do while we lived there. He also will just keep our security deposit anyway. What should we do?

If someone knows the correct answer, or what laws to point me too I would appreciate it. We are due with our third child this Summer and don't want to be dealing with a court case while I'm in labor/about to have a baby. Thank you."

37,Default Judgment,"Hello. I appreciate whatever help you can provide. I currently resides in Florida. My son had a student loan which he added by information that was in 2012. The loan originated from Salle Mae then later turned into Navient who sold the loan to LC Capital. LC Capital removed my son from the suit and made the judgment against me. What can I do now? I received a letter asking for my personal information. Also, the loan had been discharged.

38,"Purchasing, registering, and insuring a vehicle in another state","Hi, all! I live in Louisiana where insurance rates are skyrocketing. I’m looking at purchasing a new EV. There aren’t any stores here so I was planning to go look at some different models in my home state of Maryland, where both of my parents still reside in my childhood home.

Apparently Maryland has some law that they can’t sell EVs out of the state supposedly, so that gave me the idea of registering the car with my dad.

I have the utmost trust in my dad, so no issues there. If we registered the car as co-owners and I drove it primarily in Louisiana, would there be legal issues with that?

What if I were to purchase the car and be on the loan, but not on the title/registration if that’s even possible and only have it in his name in Maryland?

39,"I lost the keys to my car a few days ago, and now there's a tow sticker on it","So like I said, I lost my keys at an AirBnB a few days ago (although I may have an idea of where they may be, basically the only place I didn't look when I was tearing the place apart 20 minutes before my checkout time). Anyway, I guess since its been in the same place for nearly two weeks^(it was parked for the week I was gone & I've been back almost a week) and because I have generally nosy neighbors with **zero** chill, someone called to report it. I'm trying to get in contact with the owner of the AirBnB I stayed at to see if she'd be willing to stop by the place and take a look for me, but that could take some time. Until then, does anyone know if its possible to call someone and explain the issue, or at least ask for a bit more time before they haul it off? And if so, who exactly would I call? Would it be the police, or maybe the number I found online dedicated to *reporting* ""abandoned"" vehicles? 
Thanks y'all!"
40,(UK) Boss Withholding Pay for Hours Worked After Missing Work Unexpectedly,"Hi all,

I recently began working part time at a local pub the last four weeks. All was going well until I had to unexpectedly miss a weekend shift to deal with family matters. After that my boss did not schedule me for the following weekend, and has not given me my pay for hours worked the week prior to leaving unexpectedly. I’ve checked with other staff who worked that week and all have received their pay from that week. 

After I reached out to my boss to ask why I was not scheduled for the following weekend, they simply responded that they would like to meet with me when I am back from dealing with my family matters.

What is my legal recourse here in the UK if my boss opts to terminate my employment, and refuses to pay me for the hours worked?"

You can clearly smell mold coming from an ac vent when it turns on but the community manager will not test for mold, only ac leaks - and any test done has to be done by a professional (no kits) and at my expense. They send maintenance and he insists he can’t smell anything, again refusing to do an actual test. Meanwhile, my air purifier always reads some degree of “unhealthy” air quality, my cat and I sneeze non-stop, and I have shortness of breath and random rashes that have been so bad I’m being tested for auto immune issues. How to I proceed?

44,My company my son works for can’t pay them this week. Is this common?,"My son started this manufacturing company in January. Everything was going great. Unlimited overtime and lots of opportunities to hone his skill as a machinist. He loves it there.

That they’d all have to wait ‘til next week. The company is in California. What can be done legally? And if this is a recurring thing?

46,Will Withheld,"My father passed away from a stroke when I was 16 and my brother was 12. That was almost 30 years ago. Since we were minors, we never received a copy of his will. My mother refuses to give me a copy. I am asking with good intentions, I have no expectation of something wonky nor am I asking for money or property or anything. It is for my brother and I to have the artifact of our father’s will. It is an important part of him, especially since our time with him was so short. We look for anything. I don’t think asking 30 years later - now I am 46 - is unreasonable. But my mother apparently does and angrily refuses and tells me to ask someone else. Which would be weird and was when i did do that. Asking for the last will from for your own father apparently makes people become suspicious of you,, which is not the case.

Does anyone know if a minor who does not get a will can receive one upon becoming an adult? Or any advice on this or is it impossible?

47,Do I have to pay for damages to door after being locked out?,"I just signed the lease to an apartment yeaterdya. They did not tell me that the door key did not unlock both the locks on the door, which I feel is a reasonable assumption to make. I checked the apartment out and then locnked up and went back to my old place to start moving in. When I got back, I couldn't get in because my key didn't work in the bottom lock. I really needed to move in then and the office was closed for the weekend and timing was off the essence. Also, I didn't have a number for emergency maintenance, so I kicked the door in. I can still secure the door with the top lock, but there is ñ the door frame and a little bit to the door itself.

Do I (or my insurance) have to pay for the damage because I kicked the door or do they have to pay the damage because I was not informed that there was no key for the bottom look or that it didn't work? My mom told me the former and a friend told me the latter."
48,[FL] Falsely evicted by someone buying the house without the landlord's knowledge or consent,"Apologies for repost. This was originally posted under the flair for Real Estate law. My landlord made a good point though, that they weren't liable for anything for her, but as the tenant, I should be. I thought I'd reflair and get a second opinion since my original post was buried. Doubt it'll make a difference, but figured I'd try my luck. Sorry if this breaks any rules!

Our story will take place in Tallahassee, Florida. On March 12th, 2022, I received a ""Termination of Tenancy"" notice from- let's call her, Kunt. At the time, Kunt was my landlord's roommate, and my (duplex) neighbor's mother. Prior to receiving this notice, my neighbor has frequently spoken to me about how horrible and manipulative her mother was. Kunt shows up at my door and hands me this notice, explains that my landlord is retiring and has sold the property to her. She offered a very generous amount of time to move out (May 15th, 2022), and even an incentive to move out early. Up to this point, I had been living at this property for probably about three years. 

Not particularly relevant legally, but for some context:
My landlord is incredible. I'd had many issues with my mental health back then, and every time my landlord was so very forgiving about late rent payments and any drama I caused them. At the time, I had also just broken up with my partner, who moved into that house when I first got it. I loved that house, and considered buying it on multiple occasions. Needless to say, with everything going on at the time, I simply cried about the situation and cursed the forces that be for giving me such a rough time.

I had assumed that the sale was a done deal, and never bothered to ask my landlord about it. Fast forward to now. Comparatively, I am living in a far worse place with far more people than I'd ever wanted in my home. I've had several of my belongings stolen, damaged, and destroyed. I had to sell a lot of very valued things in order to even have space to live. Despite all that, I am doing well for myself. The only unfortunate thing is my living situation! I'm having to move, now for the third time, and thought I'd message my former landlord and offer my appreciation while I was in the headspace of having to move (quietly hoping she would potentially know of any affordable places to live in my area).

Well! My landlord texts me back shorty after asking, ""What retirement? What eviction notice?"" For those who can't pick up on context clues (or those who neglected to read the title), THE EVICTION NOTICE WAS FAKE. Kunt lied to my landlord by telling her that I was okay with moving out given sufficient time and she never thought to question it. According to my landlord, Kunt signed a contract to (if I understood correctly) buy the house on May 11th, but the house was never sold until April 30th. The notice I was given specifically states that the property had been sold to her, signed by her and everything. I even kept it for sentimental value!

Basically, I'm wanting to know if we have a case, and if so, what could either of us ever even hope to get out of this? I don't imagine she could be forced to return the house for buying it under false pretenses, but that would be my dream scenario. I'm young and completely ignorant legally. I made the mistake of telling my former neighbor all this (again, her daughter), and now Kunt knows I'm onto her. I assured her I was too broke and busy moving to a different state to take legal action, but that was only in the hope that she wouldn't preemptively start preparing a defense. I want justice for myself, my landlord, and my neighbor (who, I failed to mention is a single mother. I suspect this situation arose due to the mother wanting to manipulate her daughter and control her, and her granddaughter's life) I will take any and all advice here. Thank you generous redditors so very much for this and everything you do on this sub. Even if my situation is a bust, you're making a difference."
49,TX - apartment landlord won’t treat for bedbugs despite proof. This will be my third time requesting bedbug extermination services,"Shortly after moving in to the apartment in September, I noticed I was getting severely bitten by bedbugs in multiples of 3. Called landlord and they sent pest services that said they didn’t find any despite seeing all the bites on me. Said it was mosquitoes. Called again in March of 2023 with bites and a picture. Was told it was not a bedbug despite the bites in multiplies of three and the photo (albeit blurry). I now have physical evidence and bites and am going to call again. 

My questions are do I have any recourse in suing for rent for all the months I had them and they refused to treat? Can I sue for the amount of the pest services if they finally agree to treat (they said we would have to pay). Can I make them inspect my adjacent neighbors? Any resources would be helpful."
50,imperfect auto title solutions,"I recently purchased a used vehicle from a supposed top tier dealership and I now cannot title and register due to the dealer possessing an imperfect title from the previous owners.

I am starting the process to find legal assistance to understand my options.  I want this resolved ASAP.  Based on the time and expense I've already invested with completing this purchase, I don't want to simply return the vehicle for a refund - at least not without additional compensation.  Interested in handling suggestions but also have some liability questions?

I understand the liability still to the original owners but might there be any liability risk to me if I continue to drive it without ultimate proof of ownership?  and similar considerations.  thx."
51,Billed for No Services Rendered,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, not sure exactly where it belongs.  This is in PA.

In 2018 my husband and I purchased a LG washer and drier.  The salesman convinced us to purchase a warranty which we later realized was money wasted.  The warranty was from Consumer Protection Services (CPS).

In January the washer dies and we are in dire straights because we have a newborn and are using it for multiple loads daily.  We submit a claim using the CPS website.  The claim is accepted and a company called LG Electronics Alabama, Inc is assigned the repair with a date scheduled.  In the meantime we are frantically searching for a place that can repair it sooner. 

We find another repair place and the washer gets fixed.  LG Electronics Alabama, Inc gets in contact with my husband for the appointment and he cancels it (he has all the texts saved).  I checked the CPS website and couldn't find a way to officially cancel the claim online so I just left it open.  Probably should have called to talk to someone but had other newborn stuff to do.

Fast forward to yesterday and we receive a bill in the mail for $268 for ""Service call not covered under warranty”.  Bill dated 4-11.  Of course we call and can't get through so I send an email to the address listed on the bill explaining the situation and asking for proof of services rendered.

If the appointment was cancelled and no services were provided I can't just be billed, right?  I am hoping this is just a mistake, but if CPS pushes back, what are my best options?  I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a fighting a ding on my credit for not paying a fabricated bill."
52,Resigning & breaking contract early,"I’m a physician assistant in Georgia looking to resign from my position only a few months in to a multi-year contract. Biggest stipulation in the contract is having to repay a training fee (which training - or lack thereof - is one of the reasons I’m leaving) if you leave before the end of the contract.
Multiple PAs have left over the past year for various issues, all related to the toxic and unethical work environment.
I guess I have 2 main questions:
1) How much (or how little) should I say in my conversation with my boss telling them I’m resigning/in my follow-up resignation letter? I don’t necessarily want to come across as threatening, but I have consulted an attorney and will hire one if necessary.
2) What is the likelihood my employer will take me to court for the training repayment? From what I know, she has not taken any of the previous PAs who have left early to court, only sent vague legal letters."
53,Is there a way to find out if someone has died?,"Not sure this is the right sub so please let me know. 

My husband and I recently got a message from someone we don't know saying that his estranged brother died. They provided names of some family members as well as places my BIL frequented and people he associated with. 

My BIL and his wife are addicts and disappeared about 3 years ago. We know the last city they lived in but don't believe his wife would have done an obituary or anything like that. 

Is there any way to confirm if he died?"
54,ADA reasonable accomidation request..employer stalling,"I will be right up front and say that what happened to me at work doesn't sound very serious to most but it broke me.

I have a diagnosis of GAD and Complex PTSD. After an incident at work caused a flair up of very debilitating symptoms I requested an accomidation for my health and safety. My company has been dragging thier feet, requesting medical input and letting me know they are ""working on it"". I have exhausted my PTO. I know they have all the medical records from my doctor and they still have not agreed to any reasonable accomidations. This situation is just exacerbating my symptoms. It's been weeks. 

My request was a simple work from home solution. It is already a standard practice for the company. 99% of my work is done via email so there would be no hardship or unreasonable expenses accociated. I have been restricted by my doctor to avoid the trigger for my panic attacks, so that means no going into the office at all. Because they are unwilling to restrict the person's access to my area. The incident resulted in a slap on the wrist for them and I was informed they are a ""valued member of the team"". That is it. The person had been escalating thier behavior. I no longer feel safe and I started having panic attacks. 

Do I have enough cause to complain to my state labor board or the equal opportunity commission?

Just from the way they handled the origional incident I know they are acting in bad faith but how do I prove it?

I am in Oregon."
55,"Loaded question, model release, intimidation","I am a photographer. I never share any images without a model release. Ever. I have model releases on file from 2012 still. 

A former friend/client and I parted ways. For personal reasons not business. When things like this happen, despite my model release I remove images. It’s drama I don’t need or want for my business. No one has ever asked me to take their images down, I just do it on my own. 

Now to the dramatics of the story. 

Former Client, is a legal staff member for a government agency in the area. 
Former Client also is a bully. She found my”private”  social media account  (public account, my own fault, but for personal use)
And commented something on it. I took a screen shot of her comment and shared it. 

Her profile picture, is a photo I took of her family. 

She’s currently telling people I am harassing a public official but sharing private images of her family. (The screen shot included the profile picture that she used when she chose to comment on my stuff)…. She’s telling people she’s planning to sue me. 

The thing is, i still hold the model release. She’s never once asked me to take anything down, and the photo in question is one she put up on her social media.

I guess my question is, is there a legal limit on model releases in the USA? 

Also, does she have any legal grounds for harassment when she commented on my stuff? I’ve since blocked her, and coincidentally since then I’ve received an influx of fake account requests to all of my socials. 

Isn’t “intimidating BY An elected official” against some law? She has claimed her boss (an actual lawyer) supposedly agrees my sharing of the image is harassment."
56,My apartment neighbor is insane and being harassing. Can I leave the lease without legal trouble?,"First off, a little bit about me I’m 26 and live with my boyfriend. We put down a deposit of $2600 to live in a apartment in LA, we are new to our careers and in the case of breaking our lease we would like this deposit back. 

 We just moved to this apartment 1 month ago and the day we moved in a women who lived next to us watched us move into our home while sitting on a patio chair. Which normally isn’t too odd however we started at 9pm and ended around midnight. She just watched us the whole time out in the cold night, moving boxes into the home from a uhaul. 

About 3 days upon my move in I noticed dirty cat food dishes at my back door and the walk way in front of my apartment unit. Which is odd because she has her own space for this in front of her own door and stoop. 

This went on for the next two weeks. Eventually, when my sister came down to visit me and while walking into my house my sister asked me about the bowls.  I said, “yeah I don’t know, she puts her cat bowls here by my door and in the walkway. It’s annoying” 
Which then my sister said “you should put it back in front of her own door!“  
Then BOOM! the lady who puts the cat bowls there slams her door as loud as she can. 
I’m not sure if her door was open and slammed it or if it was always open.  
Obviously, it was not the best way to handle it. I really didn’t know she was listening. 

The next morning my boyfriend and I were in the kitchen with our window open talking about our plans for the day. All the sudden we hear a loud “F*ck you b*tch!!!!
The women came out to feed her cats and on top of her lunges started screaming “F**ck  YOU!! F*ck you!!! B*tch!! This isn’t your territory! I can do what I want!!-“ and stuff like that for the next 10 minutes. Yelling to no one but facing my unit. Im assuming this regarding what my sister and I said the day before and she must of hear us. 

But it didn’t stop there. Then she went to the center of the plaza, which is next to our unit and sat there for a while muttering stuff. 

 Since my boyfriend and I were leaving out of town for Easter, so we were packing at this time. After a while we can hear her yelling from her door again to us. The same 5 sentences over and over. “F**ck  YOU!! F*ck you!!! B*tch! Something-something in my family committed suicide!! You don’t know what I been through, this isn’t your territory!! F*cking C*nt!!” This yelling went on for about half a hour. I have never heard someone yell like this! 

Then she started blasting her music with her door open and was yelling from inside her home yelling “YOU LIKE THAT? F*ck you!!” And the sound of the music, her screaming and stuff crashing in her own home. This lasted till the afternoon. Since we needed to leave anyways we just decided to leave out the door safely holding pepper spray in case. 

After talking about the situation, we decided to txt the landlord and told her everything that happened. She replied with this message:  “Hi, I am currently out of country. I will forward your message to the office so they can reach out to her. This is the first time I heard about her disturbing behavior. She has always been quiet and keep things to herself. She has been there for 6+ years and we never received any complaints. Maybe she just had a bad day, but I will have office reach out to her tomorrow.” 
I agreed with my landlord said thank you.
I figured things would solve themselves out. However, the following day I came home around 10pm and found that the women and walked around to my garden stuff and around it she make a 4x4ft pentagram out of large stones and shells. It’s so perfect, it must have taken her a while. 

I’m assuming she’s trying to scare me?  Or she’s trying to curse me or something. I don’t know, It was just unsettling. 
I sent the picture to my landlord and haven’t touched the stones or removed the pentagram. 
My landlord never responded.

This was all 5 days ago and the crazy lady has  been silent until today. Two hours ago my boyfriend went to his car and was siting in it removing trash for about 10 minutes. He said he opened the door to get out and she yelled out from her window to him - “This isn’t your fucking territory!!! F*ck you!! F*ck you!!! This isn’t your territory!!” My boyfriend said it startled him, especially since it was 1am and dark. 
He didn’t expect her to be watching from her back window and yell at him. He said he shut his door and drove away to the other side of the apartments to avoid her.

My boyfriend and I are talking about it, we both feel like she’s possibly on drugs or something. 
My boyfriend is also leaving for two weeks soon and doesn’t feel like it’s safe to leave me here alone now. We are asking ourselves what we can do? 
We are only a month in and it’s already so uncomfortable to be here with her acting like this. We feel like we are walking on eggshells here. I share a closed in parking garage with her too, luckily I haven’t ran into her yet. I have to walk by her door to get to mine and now I don’t even wanna garden in my backyard since she can come out. 

Can we do anything to back out of this lease? Besides pictures of the pentagram we have no video evidence of her screaming and yelling at us to deliver to the landlord. 
So I guess what I’m asking is, is there a legal way we can get outta here to find good safe apartment? Can we break the lease and keep our deposit with what’s going on? 
What steps do we take? 
Thanks for reading."

They always hire outside the agency people with no experience then give me a chance. This last thing set me over the edge was we got a new Janitoral hire. When I was training, her two jobs postings became available. Human resources pulled her into her office and asked why she hadn't applied for the jobs and handed her the applications. Human Resources also told her that there was no probationary period she had to wait for her to apply. Mind you, when I got hired on I was told that I had to wait six months before I could even apply for a job with in the agency. We both put in our applications for the job postings. She got the job offer with no experience and being with us for less than a month. Human Resources is bias she also sits in on the interviews. I feel like I didn't have a fair chance. Human Resources has never done anything like that for me. Why go above and beyond for someone new? When you have a loyal and reliable employee, that's been with you for 2 years. How are they going to hire someone with no prior experience that has been with us less than a month? It's not fair! I will be giving my resignation letter because they are not an equal opportunity employer. They don't value there employees.  This is not the first time Human Resources and I had issues.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading."
58,Employer owes me three paychecks and refuses to pay,"Last summer my paychecks were running behind the scheduled pay dates at my job of 31 years.  In July they became a few days past the legal limit when I was told the business was being evicted the next morning, abruptly ending my position.  When I did not receive pay, I of course filed with the Minnesota Department of Labor, following their instructions.  They started an investigation (which consisted of two phone call attempts) and eventually told me they had no power to do anything, and I should take it to court - which I did.  I won the case (unsurprisingly), but there has been no response from the business owner.  I have docketed the judgment, and filed for an Order of Disclosure, which he has ignored.  

Going through the court system has been difficult, and every document I file costs me $50 -$60. I have so far sunk several hundred dollars in to this attempt.  Is there any other course of action I can take to actually collect my pay? Not only does this violate business law, as wage theft it is also criminal, but I don't know if it is ever enforced. I have also talked to the Federal Department of Labor, who told me they have no jurisdiction.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
59,Question about “burusera” legality,"I’m trying to figure out if woman can legally sell vaginal discharge, urine or spit for kinks? Trying to figure out for someone.

60,Cousin was seriously injured at work because of negligence and boss filed bankruptcy and now my cousin is left with thousands in hospital bills,"I haven’t been able to talk with my cousin because he’s back at work (new job). Trying to pay back all the hospital bills from the accident. But basically he got crushed by many tons of hay bales and his boss wouldn’t take blame and basically filed for bankruptcy (I’m pretty that’s the term for what he did , but not 100%, I just know his boss was shady and didn’t want to pay the bills or get in trouble, and basically left him hanging). Thankfully he’s recovered ( but he will have long-term injuries I’m sure) My cousins family can’t afford excellent legal help, but I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on this situation and if it’s worth pursuing so they could hopefully get some money for his bills. I really don’t know how to help, I just can’t believe the situation and how he was the one who got messed up so badly and now has to work even harder to pay for someone else’s mistake that caused his injuries. :/"
61,How to keep the fact that I was the victim in a child sexual abuse case private when I have to include it on my bar application?,"The state is MA, if that helps.

The C&F question is ""*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*""

I was a victim-witness in a child sexual abuse case and I also sued my abuser after the criminal case concluded.

I don't want this to become public record. I don't want the entire board of bar examiners knowing this sensitive information about me if it's avoidable. And I certainly I don't wish for the bar examiners to contact me or anyone in my family to ask questions about it.

It has zero bearing on my ability to practice law. It seems crazy that I have to include legal actions in which I was not the party who caused the harm.

I was *three years old* when the harm began (or at least when it was first independently verifiable--most likely began earlier than that.) It seems crazy that anything that happened that long ago should have to be included on my bar application. What's next? Do I have to include my kindergarten disciplinary record?

Is there anything I can do to keep this private, totally irrelevant information private?

And how many documents do they expect me to dig up for this? Finding documents (perhaps having to request documents from a court in another state) from the cases is going to cause more emotional distress than I want to be dealing with during exam. Is there any way to avoid this? I hate this."
62,Friend getting extorted and blackmailed on Instagram,"My friend did something really stupid and some random girl texted him and exchanged nudes. This supposed “girl” then got everyone that followed him into a group chat and said if he didn’t cash app 400 dollars they would send his nudes to everyone. For the past couple hours they have been sending nudes to his family and friends, what would be the best course of action?"
63,Is there a list of things I'd need to do in order to legally manufacture my own vehicles in California/United States?,"I'm spending my free time designing a car that I'd like to eventually be able to manufacture and sell in the state of California. Most of the car is going to be constructed from externally sourced parts, which will limit my upfront manufacturing costs and allow me to be slightly more economical at a small business scale.   
I need some source or something that I can read that has a list of all the laws that apply to me and my vehicle so that I can design it in a way that I'd be able to legally build said design."
64,Can I garnish the bank account of my husband (who is spending literally HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS on his mistress) for nonpayment of temporary alimony?,"The trial is almost a year away. He was court-ordered to pay alimony pendente lite, and he just stopped paying (purely out of anger), giving no notice to me or his lawyers. His noncompliance is EXTREME. He has already been held in contempt twice over other matters, and there are additional contempt motions pending.  He is not at all dissuaded by contempt motions. He is self-employed, so I can’t garnish his wages. He was also court-ordered to cover our expensive health insurance premium, and he stopped paying that as well. I am chronically ill and need medication that costs tens of thousands per month without insurance.  "
65,Do I have verified complaint about not receiving a rest break. I’m in Cali,"So I want to do something, I honestly don’t care if I get any money out or anything I just want the company I worked for to change their way of practice 

So here’s the situation:

I was employed by ******* with hours of 30+ a week roughly during my time of employment. Since the date hired I was not allowed to take a second rest break if I had worked 7.5hrs or more. And I had  if worked 5hrs or more and had taken a meal break I was not allowed to take a single rest break. When I had asked my managers if I could take one I was told that it was either too busy to take one or a response whereabouts of “you want a 10? I haven’t even taken a break” with no indication of yes or no but it pretty much meant that I wasn’t able to take one; on the off chance that I would take it upon myself to step out after notifying my coworkers that I did so, a manager would come looking for me and tell me that I had to go back to work even though I would inform them that I was trying to take a break. After awhile it had become clear that I was not able to take a meal break and a rest break without any type of snide remark that had an implication of denial of a rest break. I eventually stopped asking. It is not only myself who has had this experience, all my coworkers have aswell

I want to file a wage complaint with the labor commissioner but I don’t have any type of proof, I feel like like if I go the legal route they would have some sort of an investigator or whatnot that would be able to witness employees not able to take their rest breaks.
I have work for this company for over 5yrs"
66,How do I prove custody of an unborn child?,"Long story short, my ex is pregnant with my child. We get along just fine. I don't think any issues will arise but I am worried she might run off with the soon to be kid. We both currently live in MT. She is planning on moving in with her parents in WI before the kid is born. I have no texts or written stuff from her stating the kid is mine. Everything happened verbally. I want to have every part as much as her in the raising of our kid. The situation seems civil but I want to make sure if things go south that my kid isn't just gone from my life because I might not be able to prove it's my kid. I hope that I can be present for the birth but at the end of the day it's her decision not mine

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to take full custody or do anything of the sort

I am 30 and she is 38 if that helps clear anything up"
67,Car insurance personal injury,"Was in a wreck the other driver was deemed at fault and cited by police. His insurance called me and said they accept 100% of fault and wanted information from me. I was injured in the accident have broken bones severe brusing and took an ambulance ride and visited several orthopedic surgeons and have appointments with more in future for follow ups. Some of the bills are coming in now from the incident and are already over $8000 dollars. My question is my health insurance already paid an amount of it and say I only owe a portion of the total billed typical health insurance stuff, but the insurance is asking for the total, am I suppose to give them the total billed? The total left? The total I owe plus insurance paid or what? And if it's the total billed what happens with the leftover difference?

Second question do insurance companies pay out for pain and suffering without a lawyer or do I need to retain one? So far they only agreed to all medical bills, car and wage reimbursement though none of that has been finalized and is only a verbal agreement. 

Any insight would be great sorry if scattered first wreck I've been involved in
Thanks!"
68,Neighbor telling cops false information leading to possible harassment.," My neighbor is a redneck with his own business that takes way too much interest in my life and what goes on at my house. Sometimes it's good, if someone were to break in hedfire a gun over their heads. Other times it's bad, like recently.  We found a crossbow bolt on our property.  My bf went to the neighbors wife looking for neighbor,  he wasn't around so bf told her about the bolt, asked that if they lose an arrow to pick it up cause our dogs walk there. Neighbor comes down yelling wearing his sidearm  asking what my bf said to upset his wife, then went off on a barrage of insults culminating in him saying my bf is a dope dealer and he has video of him taking bags of drugs down the driveway to cars with out of state tags. That the cops are watching our house, taking pictures of all the tags and running background checks on the owners. Basically he says the cops are looking for any excuse to nail him (he had a warrant for child support he hid from for awhile), and the whole neighborhood knows he's a dope dealer and want him gone. We're older punk rockers and our friends are 2 train kids that come by and pick up my bf (he doesn't drive) all of them excluding my bf have medical cards as do I,  also my bf is an alcoholic  and my neighbor accused him of selling heroin. All this is very unsettling,  I own my home and don't want to move, my bf is afraid the neighbor is going to find a way to send him to jail or burn our house down, he's become very paranoid and feels unsafe here. But, my neighbor is all buddy buddy with cops and we're in a small town. So I don't think going to them would do any good. What can we do on a budget, we're pretty broke."
69,Can my sister get her belongings even if the owner of the house says no but my sister had lived there a year?,"So my sister just broke the news she wanted to divorce her husband. They are living with the husbands parents and have been living there for a year. During the breakup tonight my sister wanted to just get her belongings and leave but the mother refused and told her to leave. But the ex husband didn’t want her to leave and smashed my sisters phone on the ground while doing that.
Eventually my sister left and said she will be back for her things tomorrow. If we involve the police can my sister get her belongings or would they tell us to just leave? 
If the ex husband is there being unruly or seems very prone to breaking something of my sisters will the police take that seriously?"
70,Unclaimed money; TN RESIDENT MINORS,"So my children are minors when their grandparents  died  2  if them  weren’t born yet my ex was in the obituary and  then it just says 10 grand children and the other siblings I have no contact with his family and barley talk to him. I got mail him for the deceased, and it was one of those unclaimed properties flyers. It’s over 4K on their website it shows the decedents death certificate or obituary documents will be needed , I can get both of their obituaries but since my children are the only ones claiming I know I will need a copy of my exes state ID but he lives out of state. Only my address was only the papers and I wasn’t in the documents how would I claim it? I’m or would they make me wait for everyone to claim? ALSO these people have been dead since 08-and 11 and I’m constantly getting mail and taking to their dad he doesn’t open it he throws it away. 🤦🏻‍♀️ A LIFE INSURANCE CHECK FOR 4500 that would pay for his child’s braces YALL."
71,"Dad was victim of check washing $28k made out to the IRS in July 2022, didn't realize until January 2023 and the bank is not covering."," 

He filed a police report, filed an incident with the Post Office where the check went missing as soon as they found out in January but have not gotten any updates. He didn't realize for as long as he did because the money was taken out of the account so he thought that was the IRS receiving the payment. 

Since it has been more than 30 days, the institution where the check was cashed will not reimburse his bank, so my dad's bank will not reimburse him\* either.

He owned a small specialty garage which was just himself + 2 employees where he was the shop master doing the bulk of the hands-on work himself. He is gutted, he has to pull the missing money from his retirement because of this. He worked hard his whole life and to be swindled for such a large amount of money (to us this is huge) is devastating

No word from the police, or the post office but there have been stolen and washed checks frequently in our city over the past few years and it seems clear to many that the problem is coming from within the post office itself.

We were hoping that since it's a check made out specifically to the federal government it would be considered a felony investigation that would be taken very seriously, but have received no traction on an investigation whatsoever.

Now that the bank has chosen not to reimburse him, what are his options? I saw a previous thread where someone suggested filing a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He is looking into that currently, but does anybody have any other advice surrounding strategies or even small things he needs to do? ."
72,"Harassment has stopped, but do I still have a case?","A super weird incident happened recently. This guy that’s super pro-gun control (not making a value judgment- it is relevant to the content of the communications) started arguing with a friend of mine over instagram. My friend, “Paul” is very pro-second amendment and makes his stance known loud & proud, especially after big-news mass shootings. The other guy, “Dirk” didn’t like what Paul had to say following a mass shooting and started messaging him just a bunch of facts and statistics about gun violence, coupled with his opinions, arguments and like open ended questions? Paul blocked Dirk on instagram but then Dirk began harassing Paul via text (they used to be coworkers) with more gun-control stuff and like a weird, reverse threat? Dirk seemed to channel Ghandi or MLK and told Paul that if Paul wished to get physical, he would drop to a “submissive” posture and said he wouldn’t fight back, he’ll be defenseless and that Paul can attack him if he wants to. Paul then blocks Dirk’s number, but Dirk started using another phone to continue harassment. 

So, after this guy Dirk sends my friend texts from another phone number, Paul told me about it and I got curious of who it was. I then visited Dirk’s instagram account and watched his “story” posts a few times. If you are unfamiliar with the feature, basically this guy can see that I watched it. It shows a list of people who have viewed it. I do not follow Dirk and he does not follow me. I guess after he noticed I was watching his stories, he sent me a message directed for Paul with more gun-control stuff and like an insult about Paul’s intelligence a couple times. No direct threats. I told him to stop and then he began mocking me, telling me to block him. I felt that since he kept going after I told him to stop, he was for sure harassing me. So rather than block him, I wanted to see how much he would send after I told him to stop. He kept going. He started sending long messages in Chinese characters. More gun-control stuff. And eventually he kept mocking me for not blocking him. He was condescendingly explaining how blocking someone works. He sent a picture of the block option and said “just click it and I’ll go away.” He kept making fun of me for asking him to stop instead of blocking him. Eventually, he kept spamming the call feature on Instagram I guess to annoy me. I would ignore the call but it would just start up again. 

So after this had gone on for an hour or two, he visited my art/business page that I have linked to my personal profile and spammed comments on those posts with some “embarrassing” information he had on Paul that kinda makes Paul out to be a creepy guy or something, I’m not sure if it’s true. But anyway, finally I blocked him because I don’t need that particular page infested with weird comments. I blocked him on my original personal account as well. 



It’s been about a week and a half and he hasn’t contacted myself or Paul since then. We were wondering if we still have legal options for the harassment he did engage in? I asked him to stop and he didn’t and he also contacted Paul after he knew he was blocked. 

People are saying we don’t have a case unless his texts were threatening in nature or if it was continuing. But what do you guys think? Is it possible to take legal action against Dirk for the harassment we have confirmed and documented?"
73,Deceased Father With Child Support,"My Dad passed away but my mom is living. I never met him, but I met the family during the funeral. the court ordered him to provide child support. In nearly 18 years of my life he hasn’t given her the money. She’s currently re-filing the support papers, I just want to know where it will come from, if it does come at all ? Social Security ? His estate ? Or living members of the family ? I’m sure I missed some spots here and there so feel free to ask me questions as well for more context."
74,Can I sue the state for contaminating my drinking water with PFOA chemicals and causing my property to plummet in value? (Alaska),"I own land directly adjacent to my local airport (small town Alaska that isn't on the road network). We've had title to this land for decades, almost since statehood (we're indigenous Alaskan). When we got title, the ""airport"" was literally no more than a dirt field for bush planes to land on, no buildings, no gas, etc. Today the airport is a much bigger operation and small commercial jets come in and out, which means refueling and deicing services have been added. 

About a decade ago my family developed the land and there are now 2 single family homes (both occupied by my extended family) as well as a 4 unit apartment building. About a year ago we discovered that the airport operations had contaminated our groundwater with PFOA chemicals. As we are on a well (everyone here is on a well and septic), this is also our drinking water. The state has been providing free bottled water since this was discovered. We are now looking to sell the land, but of course, the contamination had greatly reduced its market value. The airport is owned and operated by the state. 

I know it's generally hard to sue the state but that is possible in certain circumstances. In a case like this, is it possible to either sue the state for the lost value or to have them just buy the property outright at its pre-contamination value?"
75,Wife may not return to US with children after extended stay in UK.," Im (M41) British/Australian. I live in the Los Angeles with my British/Australian wife F42). 

I’m on the EB2 Green Card with the intention of getting citizenship. 

We have two children, a boy (4) and girl (7) born in Portland.

In 2018, we moved to LA as I was starting a business. The plan was to stay there, or, if the business failed, to move back to Portland. 

The business started well, but got stifled by the pandemic somewhat, and then I became addicted to prescription medication. 

In early November 2022 it was agreed that I got to rehab in the UK, the kids get homeschooled and we spend a few months in the UK. 

The plan was always to return to the USA. This is important because my whole career is in the USA, our house is in the USA, and the children’s school and friend network is in the USA. 

I wasn’t exactly thinking straight at the time, but I did question why so much of our stuff was being sold IF we were going to return. However I was assured I was being paranoid and it was agreed that a lot of our items should be put in storage. 

In addition, we have two cats we’re paying for a couple to look after while away. 

I completed rehab and have remained completely clean. I’ve been going to NA, and my wife and her family (plus friends etc) have remarked on the change in me. In many we’ve we’re closer than ever. 

I even spent a month on my own in LA in February with work, and attended meetings and kept clean. 

We’ve been staying at my wife’s house in the middle of the countryside. It’s incredibly boring and remote, but my wife wanted time to reconnect. 

However, a week into rehab, it was decided (not with me involved) that the kids should attend a local school as they wouldn’t be socialized at home. Again, this was ‘just a few months. 

And now, my wife is making comments about not returning. Just last night, over absolutely nothing, she spat out that ‘she wish she’d never helped me, because now she’s torn between her family not wanting her to return, and me’. 

Her family spend half a year about 12 hours away in their second home. She has a sister locally, but that’s it. I have no family locally, no means of working, not network or career here. I’ve been out of the country for 18 years. 

My wife has now suggested I go back and get work, and they’ll join. My intuition tells me this isn’t true. She’s not exactly great at having difficult discussions, and I suspect when I ‘m over there, she’ll not join. 

Can she do this? I feel like I was given literally one opportunity to get better, and have gladly taken it, I’m unbelievably close to my kids and just feel like I’ve been duped. I’ve looked into work here and there is nothing (otherwise I would at least have spent the past few months working here), instead I’ve been languishing in the countryside. 

To be clear, there was absolutely NO agreement on my side to move the kids permanently. 

I have texts to prove what the plan was. I have texts to prove how much my wife thinks I’ve recovered. I have evidence that our life is still very much in the States. 

Plus the kids hate being in the countryside as all their toys etc are in storage. 

Obviously, if my wife wants out, that's okay. It's no doubt been a tough ride and I'll understand, but if so, I'll have to stay here because of the kids. The intention was always to stay in the US, I have no career, network, plus my Green Card will lapse. Do I have any options here?"
76,Got rear ended and now worried their insurance won't pay for my damages bc of the report,"I got rear ended in the state of IN. It was a green light and the car infront of me went straight ahead. I slowly pulled up with my light signal to the intersection to make a right turn and came to a complete stop bc there were pedestrians crossing from both directions. One walking and one on a Lime scooter. The car behind admitted to being on the phone and didn't see me stop bc of the pedestrians. We Exchanged info and made a call to the police for a report. Police showed up and we tell them the same thing pretty much. I was stopped waiting to make a right hand turn bc I was waiting for the pedestrians to cross.
I get the report back and this cop had put down (along the lines of) that I made a sudden stop bc someone on a scooter suddenly crossed.  
I have a strong inclination to believe the officer HATES ppl who ride those scooters, as he made it well known to us after we told our versions. He said ""their the vain on my existence..."" and ""I wish I could get rid of them"" 

I am now worried their insurance will not cover it my damages Bc of the wording that the cop used.
He really took off with a whole different narrative and it concerns me.

Anyone have experience with this?"
77,"Moving states, keeping home state residency?","I moved from my home state of Texas to Florida for a job. This is only a temporary move of about a year and a half. I will be returning back to my home state after said timeframe. Since I’m not planning on being a Florida resident, but I will be in the state for longer than the 183 residency days, would I be required to switch over my car registration and license? 

I’ve tried googling this but all information I get is people moving from a income tax state or out of state university students. Since I’m not a student and Texas is also a no income state, none of that applies to me. 

I’ll switch over my stuff if deemed necessary, but I’d rather not if I know with 100% certainty that I’ll be going back."
78,Repairs,I’ve been waiting on repairs to my property since east knock bought it last summer. Now I’m down from 2 bathrooms to 1 my house trips breakers every other day due to  half done work. I have mold in my bathrooms you won’t pay to have repairs done on with my repair fund the “repair team vp” told me it wasn’t in the budget. They sent a plumber out because water was coming up from the toilet line in my hall bathroom I’ve never seen another plumber and that’s been since 4/5/2022. When I tell you if you’re thinking about it don’t. I regret it and I’m stuck. I’m a single mom of 3 kids I can’t afford to buy another home I owned this one free and clear and I did this to try and get out of debt. and instead I’ll never be able to buy my home back. The repairs had to be done by 11/08/22  and they haven’t been. so can I sue an get my home back? because if I’m going to have to fix it out of my pocket anyway I’d rather not have to pay them almost 1600 for it; EDIT TO ADD- I have 5 years on a lease here they can raise the rent whenever. And the price on the home will go up 13% every quarter. Right now to buy it back with the issues it’s 138k. I live in TN when I ask when they will be coming I get told I have to speak to my manager
79,"A former friend lied to police, I went to jail","A former friend of mine lied to the police claiming that I contacted her employer, resulting in her termination. I never made such an action, and she admitted online that her coworkers ""narced"" on her.

Following this, I was arrested and spent a few hours in jail until my family posted bail. Sitting in the booking/bail area of the jail was extremely distressing to me, between fear of unethical COs, abusive inmates, denial of healthcare; and what if my family couldn't post my bail. My emotional health continued to worsen between being released on bail and my hearing because I was convinced my life was over; I came close to admitting myself to short term behavioral health treatment.

I'm not sure what happened on the prosecution side but I think charges were dropped because nothing happened during my arraignment (compared to others having their charges read, public defenders offered, and so on). Even after my hearing, I struggle with my mental health due to the trauma this situation has caused.

So, I am wondering if I'd have any grounds to press charges against the former friend for the severe emotional distress she caused me, including her knowingly lying to the police, my being booked in jail (which her friends enjoyed hearing about, at my expense), and questioning my freedom.

If I do have any standing, how could I proceed? I'm well below the poverty line due to my mental disabilities."
80,[US - WA] advice: collections case filed against me but haven’t received summons,"Hey smart folks — seeking advice on how to best resolve the situation I find myself in. Throwaway, because I’ve been freaking out for the past few hours and feeling paranoid. 

Overly-long backstory, short: I’ve fallen into delinquency with a major credit card provider in the last 8 months due to a combination of unexpected income shifts and poor coping skills surrounding anxiety and depression. No excuses, I know it’s my fault. 

—

So, why I’m here: I know very clearly I’ve fucked up by ignoring debt I couldn’t pay over the last 6+ months. I just ignored / avoided everything (emails, calls, snail mail) because I wasn’t willing to face it. Thanks to treatment and (attempts at) regular exercise, I had a burst of motivation today to start getting on the right track. I pulled my credit report found out I had an account in collections with what looked like a law firm. I’m sure they’ve called and/or sent mail I haven’t answered or seen, but it made me worried enough to check court records for my name. 

As it turns out, there was a commercial complaint case filed against me at the end of February, which is rather terrifying. I can’t see much information online, beyond that it was marked “archived, no docket info,” has a document list I can’t see the contents of, and has a trial date in 2024. 

I’ve torn through my mile-high stack of unopened mail and flipped through recent memory, but I don’t believe I’ve received any summons regarding the case. I’m terrified that I have some legal obligation to respond, but I don’t have anything to respond to. 

Any advice on the best course of action? I frankly can’t afford a lawyer for at least a month, at which point I will get a bit of cash from a stock sale. I’m trying to do the right thing here, but I’m fully aware I’m out of my depth, and worry that anything I say/do will stack the deck against me. 

Apologies if this isn’t the right kind of question for y’all; alternatively, thank you in advance for your thought!

Edit: one final/random question that just occurred to me: is it worth contacting the creditor to work out resolving the debt? They are name in the suit, so I don’t believe they have sold the debt to a third party. But, I’m also not sure if such an action in irrelevant at this point given they’ve hired attorneys."

82,Death threats!!!What are my next steps for getting this nut job away from my wife and I?,"Basically, she’s an alcoholic and I caught her asking an ex for money to drink. Used manipulation by telling him she was afraid of me, and send her money for a room. Real reason was booze. She didn’t elaborate or say anything specific just afraid. 
Found her at work later that day, passed out in the parking lot, found their texts and confronted her when she sobered up. 
Breaking off contact once and for all were my terms for numerous reasons, mostly because he’s an enabler. 
She called him and texted a few times for him to stop contact. 
This dude is flipping out now, making threats to kill me the most alarming text reads as follows 

“give me this guy’s number. Also his name and address if he knows I know how to find him he will back off This shit stops now I’ll hunt him down like a fucking dog and he better pray I never find him it’s ok you told me where he lives if he hurts you he’s a fucking dead man I will not stop until he’s delt with” 

There are several emails and texts with death threats to me included, he sent a string of probably 10 emails this afternoon, after he was asked to stop contacting her. Many of which include threats of physical harm and death.
 
Another reads 

“I live in the one of the most conservative cities in the country lighting up psychos is no big deal” he also mentions his “bennilli 12 gauge” again, never not once spoken to this guy. And again, probably more than a dozen threats of violence and death in the span of 12 hours.

So restraining order? Is this violating any “threat” laws? It also is across state lines, tx and az"
83,Lienholder refusing to remove lien on car?,"Okay, please forgive my explanation of this. I haven’t dealt with this sort of thing before. 

Also, this is in Virginia. 

My fiancé’s mother is in rough shape physically and has decided to gift her car, a 2003 Toyota Camry, to my fiancé. It has more sentimental value than anything, but my fiancé could definitely use a working car. 

Prior to MIL having the car, it belonged to her brother. They apparently worked out an arrangement where MIL made payments on car. It was registered in MIL’s name, she had insurance on it, she drove it, whole 9 yards. But apparently he had placed a lien on it to ensure payment. 

MIL successfully paid car off a year, possibly longer ago. Her brother sent her the title and a form releasing the lien, but MIL lost them both. 

So here we are, trying to get a replacement title from the DMV today, and there’s still an active lien on the car. They said all they need is a handwritten letter from the lienholder saying it’s released, which sounds simple. 

The problem is, dude doesn’t want my fiancé to have the car. Their family is like this, and dude will actively fight her getting the car just out of spite. 

Since the car is paid for, can DMV force him to release it? What does that look like? This car likely isn’t worth lawyering up over. I asked DMV and the lady didn’t really know. I fear MIL - who is low income and not the brightest - likely has no way of proving she ever made payments. 

What’s my next step here?

Thank y’all in advance."
84,Legal question,State is Pennsylvania. I have an autistic son he is 3 years old (non verbal) and today while he’s at daycare his mom gets a call from a police officer saying our son was found outside about half a block away from his daycare by a lady working at one of the offices in that area she called said he was putting rocks in his mouth she went to pick him up to bring him inside and he ran into the street she had to chase him. Afterwards he had to go to the hospital for X-rays to make sure he didn’t eat any rocks there was a police report filed and an investigation open with the state he was given a clean bill of health and released. I want to know can we sue the daycare?
85,I requested an exterminator for a mouse outbreak. Eleven days later and no exterminator has come and my landlord has sent notice that my apartment has unsanitary living conditions.,"I am a current student at university and have lived in my apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the past year and a half. Last week, I was doing work in my living space when a mouse crawled under my door and run into my kitchen. I put in a maintenance request that day requesting an exterminator. I am deeply afraid of mice and have been avoiding my kitchen at all cost because that is where the mouse tends to live. 

A maintenance man showed up the next day asking where the dead mouse was and I stated that I needed someone to remove the mouse living in my kitchen. He looked around and told me that the exterminator only comes to the building one day a week and that he had just come the day prior so I had to wait a week for the exterminator. 

In the mean time, I purchased a few hundred dollars worth of mice removal equipment and pet control items for my apartment. I waited a week for the exterminator to come on the day that the maintenance man said the exterminator would come but they no showed. Due to my university schedule, I was home until 3:00pm when I left my only class of the day (which started at 3:30) began.

The next day, I called my apartment complex  when I saw the mouse again and explained that the mouse was still there. I explained that the exterminator never showed like was promised and they said they would send someone my way. 

I was breaking down large boxes when a maintenance man showed up at my door. I had left my boxes next to my sofa and the trash bags, full of items the mouse got into the night prior that I had just finished cleaning up, along the wall next to the boxes.  The maintenance man asked where the dead mouse was again and I told him that the mouse was still alive hiding in my kitchen. He asked to come in and I let him in again. He looked at my boxes and said that those were good hiding spots for mice to hide in and I told him that I was just breaking them down when he arrived. 

He then entered the kitchen (which I have refused to enter for the past week) to see if there were any holes in the walls that the mouse was using as a hiding spot. I explained to him that the mouse had crawled threw my front door to enter my apartment so he left to get something to prevent the mouse from entering my apartment that way in the future. He told me he would only be gone a couple of minutes but ended up being gone for 40 minutes. By the time he has come back, I needed to get to class so I left him in my apartment to do whatever he needed to do.

Later in the day, I get an email stating that due to ""undisposed garbage, boxes along the floor, and moldy food left in the kitchen sink and oven"" I was going to be expecting a surprise visit from my landlord to inspect the property. I went into my kitchen and did see dishes in my sink I needed to wash but there was no mold on any plates nor was there any food or mold in my oven.

I have since cleaned up the boxes and trash bags but what can I do to get them to send an exterminator? Could this be something they can evict me for?"

The lease says that we are supposed to pay for the electricity but we've never received a bill in the mail. We are moving out in 2 months, so should we ignore it?

88,Small business not giving tips,"Hi so I am in the training period at a small business in Ventura county and I’m a barista. They have this system in place where you go through the “training” period and after you graduate you receive 50% of the tips in the tip pool and then when you graduate from that and show you are a leader you get 100% of the tips. 

My question is I’ve been at the training period for 2 months at this point because the test to pass literally is extremely hard and you have to memorize A LOT of shit. I’m getting minimum wage and 0% of the credit card tips through the iPad, which is 99% of tips. I get a super small portion of cash tips that amount to basically nothing. But is this legal because I’ve missed out on $600 in tips because of this dumb system. 

Any help is super appreciated thank you!"
89,Got Into Car Accident With Expired License,"I feel like such an idiot. I've been so busy with classes I haven't really been checking my mail. I got into a pretty gnarly accident today. It was definitely not my fault. There was nothing I could do to avoid this accident- I was driving at a normal speed on a road and someone pulled out of a parking lot when I suppose they didn't see me. I was able to brake and swerve into the turn lane, but they still hit me in on the passenger side of my car. So I think it was fairly easy for police (and insurance I hope) to see it wasn't my fault as I was driving on the road and hit in the side from someone exiting a parking lot (or possibly a small road with a stop sign.) Don't worry- everyone was okay. Her car didn't even suffer too much damage, but mine is pretty gnarly on the side but at least I was able to drive it home. I doubt either passenger side door open though nor do I think the windows will roll down- it was pretty bad.

The car is pretty crushed on the passenger side, and I'm very concerned about insurance since looks like my license is a little expired. A little over a month.

I called the police and the other driver and I exchanged info. The police came by and got my info, and I also gave it over the phone. The police didn't notice my license was a little expired at the time.

Obviously I made an appointment at Sec of State Monday to get it renewed. I'm so worried now- are the police going to cite me or do they give you a little bit of a grace period? **Will insurance try to not pay?** This is what I am most concerned about. Is anyone even really going to notice though? I'm so worried about this.

I live in Michigan if it matters."
90,Do I have to register my car in my new state if it’s not in my name?,"I’m about to move for FL to UT in a few months. I drive a car but my mother’s name is on the title, not mine. I plan to take this car with me to Utah but I’m not sure if I legally have to register the car under my name, then get UT-based insurance, etc. or if I can just keep the car under her name and maintain my Florida insurance. Am I able to just keep it in her name?

Thank you!"
91,Can I ask the landlord to evict our roommate or take her off the lease?,"Okay so me and my boyfriend moved into our first place together with 2 of our friends. At the time we thought it was a good idea, and roommate 1 is fantastic we lived with her for a few weeks before roommate 2 moved in. However roommate 2 is constantly complaining over every little thing, lazy (not doing chores as simple as dishes but complaining when the dishes arent clean her dishes exactly) being somewhat manipulative , and everyone in the house regrets moving in with roommate 2 and its only been one month. However roommate 2 is on the lease as a tenant like the rest of us, and I'm pregnant so all this stress isn't good for my baby. Is there any legal way for us and our landlord to get her off the lease as a tenant or evicted so our household can live together in peace again like before she moved in?"
92,Lash lift and tint service damaged my eyes and salon refusing to refund unless I sign a commercial release,"I’m pasting my google review as it best explains the situation. 

Do I have any legal entitlement to compensation? FYI the lady who did the service may not have been fully licensed yet 

I have been getting waxing and facial services at this salon since they began offering them at the end of last year. Each facial and waxing treatment I received has been outstanding.

A month ago, following my waxing and facial service, I decided to try a lash lift and tint service for the first time, 2 days before my vacation.

Unfortunately, it caused an awful antibacterial resistant double eye infection. I remember the chemicals burning my eyes when they were tugged open during the treatment. The following evening my eyes were completely red, painful, itchy and producing a ton of discharge. It damaged my eyes and left me with an excruciatingly painful infection. It felt like I was blinking through gravel and shards of glass. Every second, all I could think about was the pain through each blink. The ibuprofen and Tylenol rounds only helped take the edge off for a couple of hours and I would count down the minutes until my next dose. I couldn’t wear my contacts so I had to use only my glasses, meaning I couldn’t go in the sun or swim with my daughter on our beach vacation. I was prescribed two antibacterial drops by my doctor at home the day before I left. After using them as prescribed for 3 days, the condition only worsened and my vision blurred.

I had to seek medical care overseas and was referred to a specialist to which I had to travel to the main city to see. This was a whole day of travel on the day of a family wedding and a very expensive taxi ride and doctor/medicine fees. I also had to buy prescription sunglasses so I could both see and protect my eyes from the sun. It was a painful, scary and expensive ordeal.

This was almost a month ago and my eyes are still messed up. I can’t wear my contacts or makeup. The infection won’t fully subside and I’m having other side effects from the prolonged use of antibiotic drops and steroids. I am waiting to see a specialist here at home.

I asked for a refund for the lash lift and tint service. $65. In the form of a credit to my next waxing or facial service.

It’s standard business practice to offer a refund or at least a credit to your customers when a procedure goes wrong, yields poor results, or in my case damages your eyeballs.

I don’t hold it against the service provider at all. I know her. She’s amazing and so talented at waxing and facials. But something went wrong during the lash procedure and I’m still dealing with the effects today. It’s been scary, painful, uncomfortable and expensive. So at the very least I would expect a business to handle this with a “how can we make this right” approach and honor my request for offer a refund or credit.

I was told that I would need to complete paperwork and wait for my refund via a cashiers check. That this was “salon policy” even though the policy is not publicly available on their website and I was not informed about this policy at any point.

The paperwork that I’m required to sign in order to get a refund is a legally binding commercial release form which would not only silence me, but put me in legal and financial trouble if I tell anyone about what happened to my eyes verbally or online.

I wasn’t going to share a review or tell anyone about my eyes. In fact, I was still referring my friends there. The fact is that mistakes and accidents happen. Especially with people who are still learning. And there is risk is involved with anything you do.

In the end I decided to share, because they are refusing to give me my money back or offer a credit unless I sign this legally binding document commercial release document which releases them from all liability and puts me at risk.

No thanks. You can keep my $65.

So what I want others to know, and wish I would have known, is
1) The “salon policy” on refunds
2) That they don’t stand behind their services. It’s buyer beware and beautify at your own risk.
3) The serious risks involved with lash services.

I’m so disappointed and shocked. It is such an unethical business practice to put extreme legal contingencies on a refund or credit to which I am 100% entitled."
93,What does a bonded title do for resale value?,"Unfortunately I live in a state that requires the seller to notarize their signature on the title.. I inquired with the DMV, notary offices, and the state treasurer’s office: bonded title is my only option since I can’t get a hold of the seller.

Does a bonded title affect the resale value if I decide to sell the car?"
94,Can I keep my kids from their father? Alberta.,"My ex has 3 children. His oldest (7) is raised by someone other than him and the mom. We have 2 children together (2 and 6 months) I have sole custody of our oldest. I got sole custody when we broke up the first time because he has alcohol and drug issues, he is unreliable and mentally unstable and cannot keep a job. When we are together he is okay, he doesn’t do his full job as a parent but does help when it’s convenient but I would never trust him to take either of my children overnight. 

His oldest has become well known to the parents addict issues and frequently is let down and disappointed but their absence. My ex recently missed our oldest child’s birthday last weekend. He took off from Friday night for 6 days with absolutely no contact. This is not the first time he has taken off for several days, but he has never missed our kids birthday (given this is only the second birthday) but he has missed their first Halloween, Easter, thanksgiving sort of deal. 

I’m tired of this continuing hurt cycle he inflicts on his oldest, and it’s starting with our oldest and I’m worried my children will grow up always hurting. In a legal sense, what can I do? I know cutting complete contact can be messy and toxic but I want to prevent my children from living this life comfortably the way his oldest does. I am in Alberta, Canada."
95,Is this enough for a restraining order?,"So my roommate smokes weed in my house against our agreement - not anti 420 just have kids in my home and therefore take it outside. He will not stop despite the arrangement of an outdoor location for him. He brings different women over all the time - who walk around my children without clothing. I need him out now!! and to top it all off, he brought an illegal loaded gun to my property - in his car, yes. but the real kicker is he gave access to it to someone with an active no violent contact order protecting me from them. So he just armed him. Someone who has threatened my life on multiple occasions. Is this ground for a restraining order against my roommate or quick removal?"
96,Search warrant,"
I live in Illinois. My house was raided and they found very little meaning a used bong and a small baggy.

They are using same warrant today around 5 pm that they used yesterday at around 6 am. Is this legal."

98,"[Colorado] Paid private seller upfront for motorcycle, I received the title and bill of sale. Now they are not responding.","Hey everyone,

I found a motorcycle on Facebook Marketplace for $2000 in Golden, CO. When speaking with the private seller, we organized a time to meet at his house on February 25th. He showed me the title which shares the same VIN as the motorcycle. I looked up the VIN and verified it’s not stolen. During the showing, the bike was disassembled. The seller said he was customizing the bike, and it would take a couple days to finish. The seller is a mechanic and does this for a living; he showed me a book of other bikes he’s built. Before leaving, I gave him $200 cash as a down payment, and he gave me the title.

A few days go by and the seller mentions the bike will need some more time, and he needs the full $2000. I was leaving town for two weeks, March 1st - 15th, and I was worried he’d sell the bike, so I gave him the full $2000 in cash before leaving. We went into his house, where he had two dogs (important detail for later), and we signed a motor vehicle bill of sale on February 28th. He even wrote on the back of the bill of sale,

“I [seller’s first and last name] promise to finish build on this [Year, Make, model, VIN] and hold until buyer [my first and last name] picks up motorcycle on or before this date 03-18-2023. If motorcycle is not finished or buyer is not happy with end product full refund will be provided. 
[sellers signature]”

I felt like I could trust this guy since I have his phone number, home address, the bike’s title and bill of sale.

When I get back in town, we reconnect and set up a time to meet at my place for him to deliver the bike on March 21st. Around now he’s slow to respond. When the seller eventually picks up my call, he said that a friend was in the hospital, and he was dealing with that. Another two days go by, and he says that the hospitalized friend passed away, another friend committed suicide, and one of his dogs died. He said he’d have the bike delivered by Friday March 24th. Doesn’t happen. We speak again and he said he needed to take a vacation with his wife and daughter over the weekend. Given the events earlier in the week, I said ok, and he said we’d to meet that Tuesday March 28th. 

Since then, I have called him every day, left voicemails, texted him, and sent a Facebook message all with no response. Eventually his phone started going straight to voicemail. On April 1st, I stopped by his place to see if he was ok. A house sitter was there, who said he was out of town until April 10th. I called everyday, again to no response.

Today, April 14th, I went by his place and knocked on the door. I heard only one dog and a baby noise but no one came to the door. I sat in my car about to call for a wellness check, when I get a text from the seller’s wife from his phone. She mentioned he got into a “motorcycle accident and is resting from complications from another surgery. And will make sure he calls me tomorrow.”

With all that context, what should I do?"
99,Would this fall under a fair housing violation?,"So I apply to get my assistance animals (cats) approved by my housing provider by sending in all the documents required (care plan, therapist note, ect). I require the assistance animals for two different on going mental health problems. Without them I have problems thriving properly in my everyday life. 
My landlord originally accepted both assistance animals, but a month later requested the removal of one of them under the idea that the documents they gave me (from the landlord) were ""fake"". With this knowledge my therapist resent in all the forms needed to reapprove them. 
The landlord then rejected the approved saying ""I didn't need two"" even though my landlord isn't my health care provider, and that claim would go directly against what my Healthcare provider recommends. 
My landlord then also tried to fine/charge me for having an unapproved pet, being dishonest, and forging a document. The landlord has also in a way threatened me by claiming that I wouldn't be able to overturn her statement as she was an admin of the college and no one would belive my side. 
Do note this is a college setting, but I'm pretty sure in regards to HUD laws they are still required to follow the same laws."
100,Yellow lights that turn red halfway through,"I am a new driver and have gone through ten plus yellow lights that turned red when I was past the line and it was too late to stop so I just went through. Additionally there were two instances where I think the light may have turned red before my back wheels were past the line. I'm in Illinois and one of these intersections had a visible camera the other was in an urban empty intersection but there may have still been a camera. 

After finding out that these are all illegal I am just going to stop at yellow lights from now on. In the mean time, this all happened in the past two weeks. Should I expect 12 red light canera tickets in the mail? 2? What are the chances I won't get any tickets? How much are the fines and most importantly will they count towards violations that will suspend my license? I already have an accident on my record that resulted in a ticket and counts as a strike on my driving record. 

I'm freaking out and tried researching these answers but there were not straight answers. 

Thank you."
101,My mom is being scammed out of her home of 18 years!,"My disabled mother is being scammed out of her home of 18 years !

In 2005 my mom “purchased” a home with what she understood to be a “co-signer” (my stepsisters husband, we’ll call him G). My mom has lived in the house since & paid every bill & made every mortgage payment. The house is an older build & has been needing major repairs. Mom attempted to have the repairs done & came to the realization that she is no where on any of the house paperwork or the loans for the house. She immediately attempted to contact the G & is told he doesn’t know anything & he doesn’t want anything to do with the house & he was gonna sign it over to my step sister in their divorce & so she could sign it over to my mom. Well the divorce happened. My dad contacted his daughter regarding the house & she pretty much told him to go screw himself, she didn’t want anything to do with him or the house. My parents continued living in the house, continued making the mortgage payments. Continued attempting to make contact with G & my step sister to no avail. Well one of the loans on the house has matured & they’re wanting full payment of the remaining 13k on the loan or they’re threatening foreclosure. My mom became disabled & is on a fixed income. My dad is a migrant field worker & doesn’t make as much because he is elderly, suffers from diabetes & is going blind. My sister & I were able to locate G using social media, public records, google maps & a little detective work. We went to his residence & informed him of the situation & told him we are willing to pay off the remaining balance of both loans all he has to do is sign over the house like he originally agreed. 
He is refusing to sign it over until the ex wife signs. He claims he signed it over in the divorce, but on the divorce decree the property address is incorrect (goes to show how involved they’ve been with the property) & the title is still in his name & only his name. We drove 4 hours to visit my step sister & ask her to sign, well she’s still bitter from her divorce & is demanding half of what the property is worth. I honestly feel they’re gonna screw my mom over for something she’s invested so much into. My parents can’t afford legal help, can’t afford to move & will soon be homeless. Any advice?"
102,Father in law issues,"When I got married, I helped my in-law grow his business. As he progressed, I helped him finance a work truck. It’s in my name, but he pays it. The only thing I asked of him was to pay on time. A year later, he’s made several late payments that I had to cover so I wouldn’t have late payments on my credit. He always pays me 1-3 weeks late.  

I can’t continue to cover the truck payment till he catches up because it puts a strain on my finances. He also continues to promise he’ll pay everyday and never does. The constant disappointment over the last year has really taken a toll on me mentally.

Can I just take the truck and sell it? How do I repo it from him? Just take it?"
103,Law firm sent a letter threatening to Garnish my wages and sell my Assets Ontario,"Long story short, my mom got into a very bad accident in Pakistan while visiting her mom. I had to urgently send money to cover a life-or-death medical procedure, totaling CDN$9500. To help cover the costs, I borrowed CDN$5000 from Firestone Financial a few months ago, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I have fallen behind on my payments. Recently, a Fairstone representative visited my dad's house (where I currently reside) and presented me with a document from a lawyer demanding payment of $6700, threatening legal action, wage garnishment, and asset seizure if I do not comply. Unfortunately, I am unable to prioritize this payment at the moment, as I have other financial obligations to meet.

A few things to note: I am a 20-year-old dual citizen of the US and Canada, and I work/school in Detroit while currently living in Windsor. I'm pretty sure the CRA does not know about my US income. Can they garnish my wages in the US over 6.7k? The only asset I possess is a 2003 Honda Civic with US plates (Illinois). Would they know the car is mine? And would they be able to seize it? This will get me fired from work and while I intend to pay off the debt eventually, I am unable to do so at this time. I don't need a lecture on morals, as I had no choice but to send the money for my mom's medical procedure and would do so again in a heartbeat, so please, save it for someone else. I just need advice right now

Can y'all help me understand my legal options and potential consequences in this situation if I let it go to court?

104,Pawn shop messes up my account and sells my laptop when they shouldn't have.,"Hi, I'm new here and on mobile so not sure how things work. I'm honestly not sure if this belongs here.

Sometime last year I pawned the laptop my ex bought me for valentine's day because I was in a bind and needed food and gas. 
 Two months ago I went to go get it out after paying on it the whole time it was in there. Which was only three months since I try to rotate between my three items. 
 I learned that the day I went to go get it they had sold it because it was apparently past due despite me paying on it the month before. 
 When bringing it up to one of the managers they discovered the account was tampered with and messes up so it showed the laptop over due and able to be sold I assume to the person who messed it up in the first place. 
 They since fired the person but haven't made any attempt to replace the laptop with one they have in stock or give me any money so I can replace it myself. 
 
Some information. The laptop was a gaming laptop an acer predator Helios 3000(I think I can't remember exactly) it was about $1,300-1,400 on Amazon. 
I personally cannot afford that or any other laptop to replace it as I'm on the streets in an rv with no transmission at the moment. And was in the same rv when it was given to me. I also can't afford any lawyers and honestly don't know how to go through that process. 


 I just feel like they should of done something about it since I always go there and pawn with them and almost always gets my stuff out. I've been with them for over 2 years now and know most of the staff. What should I do?"
105,My lawyer asked me to review a 60 page insurance policy in order to 'save me money'. Is this common?,"So the short version is I had a contractor who did shoddy work on my home that will cost a 100% refund and then some to fix.  We got a lawyer to help facilitate reimbursement as the contractor was refusing to pay the full amount.  The contractor originally tried to make an insurance claim, but it was closed due to shoddy workmanship not being covered.

Our attorney was given a large binder of pictures, previous communications, and snapshots of the contractor not being appropriately licensed at the time of the job (I know, I should've checked).  He pursued the insurance policy believing that was the best means of financial restitution and got a hold of the policy, which is a 60 page document.  

I have a promotional rate through my employer for the first 25 hours and had them make a note to apprise me of how many hours have been billed.  Our attorney initially was confident that this would be resolved well before those were used up.  So far we're at about 7.  Today he indicated that he was worried about going over 25 hours and that I could save some hours by reviewing the document myself and finding anything pertinent to our case.

Up until this point I've already compiled lots of information and was kind of gobsmacked that  I was being delegated further legal work when all I can tell that's been done is they procured the insurance policy.  The rate goes up considerably after the 25 hours is used up to the point where it's counterintuitive for the size of the claim.  

I was in the process of writing a terse email regarding how I feel like they're just bilking me and that delegating insurance policy review to a non-legal entity seems like an opportunity for a miss.  But this is my first time dealing with a lawyer.  Is this an understandable ask?"

108,Served 60 day eviction notice,"Hi everyone, I got served a 60 day eviction notice due to “demolish or substantially remodeling”. We are in L.A county and the company acquired the build ring from previous company less than a year ago.  Since then they tried to increase our rent to the maximum permites by the local rent control. They are evicting all units rented by previous tenant. New tenants units (around 6) are not being evicted. Is this legal? What can I do? Here is a copy of the signed notice. 

Edit: New tenants are being charged double our rent. 

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that your tenancy of the hereinafter described premises is hereby terminati of the date sixty (60) days after the service of this NOTICE upon you and that you are hereby required to and surrender possession thereof to the undersigned on or before the date sixty (60) days after the service this NOTICE upon you. If you fail to comply with the terms of this notice, legal proceedings will be institt against you to declare the forfeiture of the lease or rental agreement under which you occupy the hereinabe described property and to recover possession of said premises, to recover court costs, and attorney's fees as permitted by law.
This is intended as a sixty (60) day legal notice for the purpose of terminating your tenancy aforesaid in accordance with the California Civil Code sections 1946 and/or 1946.1. This NOTICE is also being served pursuant to California Civil Code section 1946.2(b)(2)(D) because the undersigned intends to demolish or substantially remodel the property.


BE ADVISED THAT you are entitled to a waiver equal to one-months' of your current monthly rental rate to be applied to the final month of your tenancy. The amount being waived is $991.14. No rent is due for the final month of your tenancy. If you fail to vacate, the rent waived shall be recoverable as damages in an action to recover possession.


You have the right to request an initial inspection of your unit and be present during that inspection, which occur no earlier than two weeks before the termination of the tenancy and during normal business hours.


State law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the ten subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general these costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out."
109,Should I sue my landlord?,"Should I sue my landlord?

The beginning of March our air conditioning unit went out, it was 90 degrees in Texas. It took them two weeks to fix this issue. April 11th at 5 in the morning half of our house lost electricity and our air conditioning unit lost a leg of a power (brand new unit) so now we are going on five days of no electricity. We put in a service request promptly and have sent photos of our thermostat. It is currently reading 79 degrees and will be in the 90s this weekend. We have a property management company (mynd management) and I know the landlords name. We also have a toddler so a 90 degree home is not a safe environment.

They sent two electricians out this week who stated this was the homeowners problem because the underground is out. They called me tonight saying it was our issue and to contact Center Point. So we did and they once again confirmed this is the home owners problem. So we wasted the entire day when they could have sent a vendor over to fix it.

Is this grounds to sue or end our lease for unlivable conditions? We pay $3,150 in rent. Our electricity bill has gone up $150 since these issues started and my dryer I believe is also broken due to the electricity issue. 

What can I do to escalate this and have these issues resolved?"
110,Tenant Does Construction on Rental Property: What should be done to limit liability?,"Dad is executor of family trust that contains a run down trailer park. There is a manager on site but my dad checks in about once or twice a week. Having problems with a tenant who hasn’t paid rent in forever. Dad will start eviction soon (issue with eviction moratorium in Los Angeles County, CA).

Without permission, tenant did some brick/cement work on a lot. After it was done, he presented it to my dad and asked for payment (well, tried to barter it into taking off some of the rent he owes). Dad obviously refused, said he never contracted him to do anything, etc. etc. On-site Manager said he had no idea this was done and didn’t notice him doing it to stop him.

Question: does my father need to destroy this work to release himself of liability? Does leaving it up expose him to anything? The guy works in construction, but not sure about licenses or codes or anything that would ensure it’s safe."
111,I got swindled by a handyman that worked on my fathers home. Can I appear in small claims without my father?,"I reside with my father, who is the sole owner of the home. I care for him as he is elderly and mentally unfit. I hired a handyman to do some home renovation with his permission. Said handyman left the job after receiving payment. I filed a small claims complaint against the handyman with me being the only plaintiff. My father never communicated with the handyman during the times he was working at the house. The financial loss impacted me as I was the one who signed the contract and paid out of my pocket. Is my father required to appear to court with me?"
112,Restaurant sold the business without paying employees,"This has not affected me personally so I won’t be speaking with lawyers about this.

However the story is that a local restaurant closed and sold their business to new owners without ever paying employees at least a paycheck or two. It has sparked a big debate in my area about what the former employees should do.  What would the legal options be for those former-employees? I don’t see it likely that the new owners would assume financial responsibility unless there was a lien (which I doubt there is)."
113,Is it legal in California to tow a private car on owner’s property at their owned residence?,"We own a home in Los Angeles. We own a car with current (not expired) tags that has a broken transmission parked in our own driveway. We haven’t been able to tow it due to financial constraints. 

A company owns the undeveloped land behind our home. They have an easement to their property that includes our driveway. We are not blocking the owners from accessing their land (which can only be accessed by foot at the end of our driveway). However, they often come without notice and bring big trucks and contractors to do work (not permitted) on their land. 

They’ve asked us multiple times to move our car so they can bring contractors to park in our driveway to do work without notice. We have explained that it’s our driveway and the car is not working so it’s not that we are being difficult, we just can’t move it. 

They said if we don’t move it by next week they’ll tow the car at our own expense. Is this legal? What remedies would we have in Los Angeles if they do tow our own car off our own property? We have tried reasoning with these people but they are very nasty and threatening to us and we’ve tried getting the Sheriff involved in the past but they don’t do anything to help us. I’m afraid for our safety."
114,[CA] Apartment owners charging carpet replacement,"Throwaway.

Hey all. I recently moved out of my large apartment complex about a week ago. I lived there for 1 year and 3 months with my roommate. A large corporation owns this complex if that matters. During a pre inspection, 2 days before move out, we were told to paint some chips on the wall but that was it. During the final inspection we were told on top of covering some minor paint chips in my roommates room, both bedrooms carpets needed to be replaced due to “stains” .. the only reason we didn’t shampoo our carpets was because our carpet shampooer broke down and we didn’t have time to get another. The stains are just from us walking around with shoes on that can be removed with a carpet shampooer like i’ve done many times before in that apartment. 

Per our lease the carpet replacement happens when there is damage and can cost up to $1150. How do I argue that there is not damage without getting a lawyer involved or having to fight this in court? This is ridiculous. My carpet is not damaged and barely even stained. I showed pictures to everyone in the office and the property manager was unwilling to even look, stating if the inspector said there’s damage then there’s damage."
115,Valid Marriage?,"Had a wedding ceremony in Nevada in 2015 while residing in Maryland. We lived in Maryland for 5 years, Texas for 5 years, then Oregon for a year. Is our common law marriage considered valid or invalid in Oregon?"
116,Did I commit mortgage fraud?,"So my soon-to-be ex husband and I decided to divorce. He was trying to buy a house but couldn’t qualify for a loan on his own, and we still had a joint account open. He asked me to sign a “gift letter” for an amount that was less than what we had in our joint account, and I felt bad for him and signed it. He never withdrew the amount, and closed on his house a year and a half ago.

Finally getting around to doing divorce paperwork, and the divorce has gotten VERY nasty. I’m worried the gift letter will come back to bite me in one of two ways:

-Will he claim that I owe him the money, since he never withdrew it? (He also has never asked me for it or indicated that I owe it to him.)

-If he gets busted for mortgage fraud some day, am I going down with him?

He’s tried to pull every dirty trick in the book to get his hands on the substantial inheritance my grandmother left me, so I don’t put it past him to use this against me somehow. Thank you.

Edit to add: I was trying to keep this from being recognized so didn’t share this detail: the discovery request from his lawyer asks how I “characterize the $X gift”. This could have gone on r/divorce, but thought it would apply to any gift letter situation. 

Really, though, can I report him for mortgage fraud without getting myself in trouble?"

118,"Was hit by a car while biking in cross walk, the cop who showed up said I was at fault","In Texas. 

I was riding my bike on a side walk. I approached a crosswalk and there was a car stopped there. They were stopped for a long time. Like they had plenty of time to go before i entered the street. Because they didn’t go I assumed that the car was waiting for me to pass- I could not see into the windshield. 

Well turns out (witness account), that she was on her phone. That’s why she was stopped for so long. She accelerated without looking up from her phone and hit me with her SUV. She didn’t brake until her big ass car body slammed the ever living shit out of me. She was accelerating to turn into a highway feeder road with a 60mph speed limit. 

I broke my collarbone and busted my face open. She got out of the car saying “I’m so sorry I’m so sorry” freaking out and I could see she was on the phone with 911 already. I was like immediately high on my own adrenaline and was super calm. 

When the cop showed up he took my statement and stated in the police report that I was the at fault party and that I didn’t take an ambulance to the hospital. (When he showed up I was so out of it I didn’t even realize I had a broken bone and eventually the paramedics convinced me to go with them to the hospital)

Anyways- what are my chances of winning the lawsuit against her given what the cop wrote in his report?"

121,"Boss Says I Should Take All Conversations With Dangerous/Loud/Mentally Ill People Outside Of The Store (California, USA)","Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out if my boss is asking me to do something that is illegal or not.

I work in a very dangerous area with lots of mentally ill, homeless, and drug addicted people.

Sometimes they come into the store I work at and yell, ask me to call them an ambulance, let them use the restroom, or just give them some masks or other stuff. Other times they just want a place to sit for a bit and will get aggressive if you talk to them and ask them to leave.

Once a man came in and he was yelling and raising his voice when lots of customers were around. I was busy and my coworker asked our boss to come out of the back so we could just have power in numbers.

Boss came out, talked with the man for about 5 minutes and then convinced him to leave.

My boss said next time my coworker and I are empowered to handle these situations on our own and we should take it outside so we don’t disturb the customers.

My coworker and I are both small people who have been threatened by homeless people in the area before, and do not feel comfortable asking potentially dangerous people to continue the discussion outside of the safety of the store. Also to me that sounds like an invitation to fight.

Let’s say I listened to my boss, took the person outside, and they injured me. (Knifes have been pulled outside the store before.) could I sue the company for my boss telling me to take it outside?

Also I am already talking to my company’s HR department about other things this boss has done, so I’d like to know if this borders on illegal and if yes, then I will mention it to HR as well.

I would appreciate any help and responses. Thank you.

(P.S. in case this sounds stupid I am very sorry. I have a learning disability so some things that are obvious to others may not be to me.)"

123,"Did I get screwed over by my family member? Car I was making payments on got totaled, I got only a portion of the payout I think I should have gotten (long post)","Hi all, TLDR at the end.

I need a bit of advice on judging this situation because honestly, I am not sure what I got myself into with my family member. I am feeling as if I got screwed over or perhaps handed the short end of a stick. Then again I am completely new to how all this stuff works with car buying. Please be gentle with me as I am aware I have limited knowledge and I could have made a huge mistake here.

Background:

A couple years ago, my aunt offered to sell me her vehicle which was a 2011 Infiniti EX35 for a very big 'family discount' of sorts. It had 175k miles on it but at the time I just needed a car so I thought, eh, I'll take it. She was planning to trade it in when she went to buy a new vehicle but decided it might be good to sell it to me since I was in need. We agreed in a text message that I would just pay her $150 a month for 24 months (total price $3600) with no interest or anything of that sort. After the 24 months, she would transfer the title to me. Maybe this is where I went wrong first, but I dunno. I trusted her very much. I am beyond grateful for the deal I got cut on this...at least until now (I will get to it soon).

I drove the car ever since I made the first payment and I have never missed a payment. There was no official contract of sorts, I just made sure I Venmo'ed her what was required every month. The entire time I drove the car, I was expected to pay for all the regular maintenance and also repairs such as the engine. I also bought new things such as a new set of tires and a battery as well. I didn't buy comprehensive insurance on it because I wasn't planning on needing it. I did pay for liability insurance on it though.

&#x200B;

Problem now:

Things were going well until the end of January this year when I got hit by someone at a stop sign. The accident was not my fault, so my insurance did not take liability for it and the other person's insurance had to pay for all the damages. Well, it turns out, the repairs exceeded the value of the car so the car was deemed a total loss and the other person's insurance paid out $8000 to the title holder, my aunt.

Now... This is where I have an uneasy feeling.

During this time, I began to look for another used car to buy and she told me she would help me pay for another rental after the insurance rental ran out, plus use ""some"" of the money on the downpayment for my next car. Of course, because she had to spend some on the rental. At this time, I only owed her 5 more months of the payments ($750 total) but she said I didn't need to pay that to her. I figured she would have just taken the $750 out of the $8000 she got paid, and then given the rest of the money to me. At least, this is how I came to understand that a normal lien situation would play out if I owed money to someone and the car got totaled. But she sent me only $1500 and when I asked where the rest was, she was confused why I expected that I was going to get the full amount. I didn't expect to get the full $8000, I really only thought I would get $5600 or so, because of the money I still owed her PLUS what she spent on my rental. She seemed upset that I thought I was supposed to get the money from the car being totaled.

In the end, she gained $2850 from me over the past months PLUS the $4900 leftover from the insurance payout after she paid me $1500 and $1600 my rental. I feel that she profited more off of this situation. I am a bit frustrated that the full money that should have been paid out to me (if only I had 5 months more time to get the title in my hand before getting in a wreck) is going to her even though she did not sell it to me for $7750 or more. She was selling it to me for $3600.

I am a complete noob in this situation and quite frankly, I am not sure who is being unfair here. I do feel as though I have a right to the 8000 minus 750 I owed, minus 1600 for rental car. But I only got a small cut of 1500. I didn't want to cause discourse between us but I do want to voice my concern to her if she is being unfair. Since I'm a bit clueless about how this would work normally, maybe I am wrong?

Any advice or input before I start spouting nonsense toward her would be very much appreciated. I would love to know what your thoughts are.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My aunt offered to sell me a car at a family discount and she would transfer the title to me when I finished paying a total of $3600 over 2 years. I just paid $150 through Venmo on-time every month. I also paid for all the maintenance on the car + liability insurance. 5 months before my last payment, another car hit me and totaled the car. The title was still in my aunt's name, she got an $8000 payout from the other driver's insurance. I expected she could keep $750 of the payout because that is all I owed her now. Instead, she took $4900 for herself and she only gave me $1500 + we spent $1600 on a rental for me. She was upset when I asked her where the rest was, so I left it alone for a bit. I am feeling a bit cheated because I expected that she would only take $750 cause that's all I owed her. But also this could have been completely my fault for agreeing to this kind of payment to my aunt with no legal contracts/loans or anything. Before I confront her, did I misunderstand something here? Is there nothing I can really argue about because there is not much in writing? Please be gentle with me as I am very much a noob in this situation & I really just depended on my aunt's word for all of this deal. I appreciate all advice & input."

128,Job making me clock out to use restroom,"
Hey all,


I think I am being target for discrimination and potentially ADA violation. I work from home.


I have an accommodation on file for frequent restroom breaks due to the medication. I just wanted to have this on file to avoid any conversations that come up regarding bathroom usage.

I am required to write down the time I leave and return from the bathroom and provide it to my manager at the end of the day. 

My bathroom breaks aren’t excessive I mainly go once an hour for 5 - 7 minutes. 

My manager is on leave and currently reporting to a new manager for the time being. Since then they have put my bathroom breaks as unpaid time on my schedule. Up until this point all my bathroom breaks have been paid and we’re solely used for tracking purposes for my schedule. 

I reached out to the accommodations agent and they advised that ADA breaks protect time off and are not wage replacement.

My original approval letter did not specify that bathroom breaks would be unpaid and they never mentioned it before. 

None of my other coworkers have to report their restroom breaks and I didn’t either before I had an accommodation.

Is this illegal? It doesn’t feel right. Please let me know how I should handle. Thank you all!"

130,Apartment Insurance Trying to bill me for the damages.,"About 2 years ago there was a fire that occurred at the apartment I was living at. It was determined to be an accidental grease fire. Recently I was sent a letter by a law firm representing the management company and the apartment complex stating that I am being held liable for more than $400,000 in damages. I had renters insurance up to $100,000 liability. I am wondering what are next steps for me. I have yet to call the insurance adjustor for the claim about it as I just got the papers today. Will I be held liable to pay whatever my renter's insurance doesn't pay? I was led to believe at the time by the apartment complex people after the fire that the renters insurance would cover up to the max liability and then their insurance would kick in and cover what was left over. So now I am being blindsided by these papers that I have received. All I had was verbal confirmation that I was going to be in the clear and wasn't going to be held liable for any of the damages.

136,Pursuing Disability Insurance - Colorado,"Hi internet friends - TLDR: How does one pursue disability income/health coverage? Person in question is currently employed/has disability insurance, but has put in notice because they have a degenerative disease which is currently impacting ability to work (and will likely worsen).

Background: State of Colorado. About a year ago A was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. There is not a named diagnosis, but it is in the centromere family of autoimmune diseases (forgive me if this vocabulary is wrong). This disease has been confirmed by three separate physicians via blood test. The primary symptoms are a stiffening of soft tissues, intermittent decreased mobility, fatigue, general inflammation, pain. The diagnosis is likely degenerative, and may worsen with time (possible future outcome/worst case scenario is inability to move most or all of A's body, and/or heart failure). A, on the advice of primary care, rheumatology, endocrinology, and naturopathic specialists/doctors, has taken steps to lesson symptoms of this disease including changing diet, trying different supplement and medical protocols, and decreasing their workload. A has not been using FMLA (their employer approved time off without formal FMLA), but has been using one sick day per week and one or two work from home day(s) per week. A works in a professional job (state gov job, desk job), but finds it difficult to manage symptoms working full time (ie. maximizing rest, exercise, diet). A has put in generous notice (to quit) at their work (about six months), and intends to work long enough to fully train their replacement (ie. end date is flexible). 

Info: A's direct supervisors have been supportive and kind. They have not requested doctor's notes, and are fine with A's modified work schedule. They would love for A to stay, but understand the reasons for leaving. A's job is intended to be fully in-person, and does have functions which can only be done in person. HR at A's work is removed from their department, and supports \~4k admin staff at A's regional office. A works in a small field office, and lives in a rural part of the state (so A may need to travel a great distance to find specific types of legal or medical support).

The question: Can A apply for long term disability through their employer while still employed (likely for 2ish more months given typical hiring timelines)? They work for the state gov, so presumably have good benefits (although sick leave balance is running low). While there is not good information about how long A would be able to sustain working part time, or how quickly their disease is likely to progress... A does not want to spend whatever ""good years"" they have left managing symptoms well enough to work as much as possible (currently 2-3 days per week in office). They would rather manage symptoms to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible. I have heard that is can be very difficult to get disability, even when disability insurance is available, as in A's case. Is there a specific type of attorney that A might contact to request support in documenting/filing for disability? Would A need to completely lose the ability to work before applying for disability, or could their doctors confirm that this disease is degenerative to help with a disability claim? What can A do at this point to pursue a modest disability income, and possibly ongoing medical coverage (such as Medicare) after they leave their employer? If A leaves this job without setting up disability, is it possible to get disability as an unemployed person once the disease progresses?"
137,My professor is making assumptions I am procrastinating when I actually just found out I was pregnant and was sent to the hospital. I’m now failing even with medical evidence. Is this discrimination?,"Context: my friend told me this was discrimination. I don’t know if it is. 

I am a good student. I have a 3.8 gpa. In all of my classes I have never been late on an assignment. This professor has us ask our questions in a discussion board instead of emailing him. This way our classmates can help us. 

I was under the impression I was doing something wrong for weeks. I posted my issue in the discussion board multiple times. I went through troubleshooting steps my classmates suggested. Nothing worked. Finally I panicked and emailed him. It was then, after two assignments failed due to this error, he tells me it is a tech error (from a university program) and he tells me to file a ticket. I did. 

Then he decides to include in his email about how I shouldn’t wait until last minute. I am a mother to a toddler. I work 50+ hours a week and I just found out I was pregnant. As mentioned above this week I was sent to the hospital due to complications. I also have adhd and have been forced to come off of all medication. 

Needless to say, I have been struggling. The reason why my friend thinks it’s discrimination is because I haven’t procrastinated. I’ve worked on my assignments every night and all weekend with little to no sleep because I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong (which turned out to be a tech issue). Therefore the professor was improperly making assumptions. 

The reason why I don’t is because it’s not like he knew I had adhd or was pregnant. Although I do think it’s inappropriate to assume those things, I don’t know if that’s what’s going on here."
138,Short term disability,"So I recently been having some mental health issues and took fmla and did short term disability from my work. Everything was going fine. I was paid for the first 3 weeks then I was advised to see my dr again to keep my leave up to date. Did that. My doctor sent them everything they needed. And I got “we are having a physician review your doctor notes etc” now my claim is at a standstill. Is this normal? Any experience with this? Do I need a lawyer?

She wants to make a video about it for her YouTube channel.,"My wife found a file with her employer’s pay information and was disappointed with the salaries of some coworkers, hers included. She also recently started a YouTube channel and thinks it would be a good idea for shorts videos, exposing pay differentials for common jobs.

142,"[CO] Can a father keep a child from the mother if the parents are unwed, but voluntary paternity was established at birth?","In the state of CO, unwed parents can opt to sign a voluntary Acknowledgement of Parentage form at birth. This establishes paternity for the father. 

Also in the state of CO, for unwed couples, mothers maintain sole physical and legal custody until a court order is established. 

My child’s father and I signed the paternity form and we have always been unwed. Now separated. 

So in this case, if the father refuses to return the child at the agreed upon time, what can be done? Will the police be willing to get involved and demand the father return the child to mom? 

Also, if the father goes to work and leaves the child with family, can the mother/police then intervene to regain the child (since the child is not technically in the fathers custody at this point?)

I want to give my child to her father when he is not at work, in good faith that she will be returned to me before he returns to work. However, I’m not 100% certain he won’t try to keep her and give her to (very unsafe) family while he works.

Thank you in advance!

I had just gotten off work during heavy ish traffic,  I was in the left lane trying to merge into the right lane (1 way street 2 lanes) had my left turning signal on and waiting until safe to merge I had been waiting for a solid 30 seconds to a minute trying to merge so it wasn’t a last minute decision I had already established I wanted to change lanes, other driver pulls up into right turning lane and turns right full speed as I’m merging and I had a spilt second to stop I slam my breaks my car jerks to a stop but other driver was pulling out of his turn so fast that the passenger side bumper collided with his driver front door causing my car to jolt forward, He claims it was my fault because he was turning right but I already had my turning signal on to merge before he even arrive at the turning lane he said he had a green light to make his right turn but there is no possible way he could have seen my turning signal plus front bumper nearly In the right lane trying to merge he also said he was trying to make a call as he was turning it very possible he was distracted I triple checked for on coming traffic when I did my final check he was not at the turning lane so I believed it was safe to proceed. Cops arrive I get hit with failure to maintain lane and no proof of valid insurance (context: my mom handles our insurance, at the time I was very unaware that I had no insurance my mom hadn’t told me anything)  guy says he has a dash cam but didn’t tell the officer or show it to determine who’s really at fault. I know I will take some type of fault because of the no insurance but am I wrong? I indicated I wanted to merge, I wasn’t distracted, I checked mirrors and blind spots I’m very confused!? please help.

Also forgot to mention the other driver wasn’t even sure what happened himself, at first he said I was making an left turn from the opposite street into the right lane (I was not I had been travel straight my entire journey up to point of the incident) then he said I ran the red light from the left lane trying to merge into the right lane but I was always in the left lane and my light was most definitely green I believe cop sided with because I had no insurance at the time as of right now I am insured (accident was yesterday 4/13/2023"

146,Minor Mistake in Living Will - Virginia,"My grandfather created a living will that designates me to be the sole beneficiary and the executor. Additionally, I have the same name as him. Everything regarding that much is correct. What isn't correct is such:

""In the event my grandson is unable to serve or fails to qualify for any reason, I nominate and appoint my son, ***same name as grandfather, Jr.***, to serve as Executor in her place and stead.""

He's only had one child, my mother, who's deceased. This son mentioned doesn't exist, and it's clearly an honest mistake by the attorney. I was present during the signing of this will, and it was made clear that I would be the only executor with no backup.

147,Property Management Company won’t refund my money and they’re ignoring me,"Hello, 

So I applied for this property and paid the $50 app fee, upon approval they require $1645 deposit to hold the unit (mind you when I paid them this at 4pm MST the unit stayed on their website until the next morning around 9am when I changed my mind) after sending the money they sent me the lease agreement. Once I reviewed it I decided I didn’t want to rent with them because It just sounded like a headache of a property company to deal with so I declined to sign. The lady then calls me and I tell her I declined to sign. She then starts getting upset because they “took the unit down and denied applicants”. I told her you said this was refundable when I asked you before sending it over and she said yeah it’s refundable at move out & I responded and told her well I didn’t sign a lease so you can’t legally keep my money. She gets upset and is just arguing back and forth and tells me to reach out to my bank. So I reached out to my bank and filed a claim and of course they can’t help because I processed the payment with my checking information which the lady told me to do because the fees would be cheaper this way… so anyway the property company was messaging me back and forth through the portal saying they can process a check of $1400 but they’re keeping the $250 admin fee, even tho I paid them $50 which should cover the cost to process my application and background 
check. So I keep asking them why they’re keeping $250 and that I will pick up my check to let me know when it’s ready and I keep telling them in the lease it says the lessee is required to pay the deposit and admin fee but I didn’t sign the lease so they are not entitled to keep that money. So anyway I see their office is almost closing and they haven’t responded so I try signing back in to the portal to send another message and now the portal is deleted but I do have emails of their responses still. Btw this is in Arizona. Please let me know what you guys think"

149,"[WA, USA] Am I required to submit the Motor Vehicle Claim for Damages form?","Hi everyone,

I recently got into a major accident that was not my fault, and unfortunately, my vehicle was totaled by an uninsured driver. Thankfully, my insurance company will be providing me with a pay off soon. However, I received a Motor Vehicle Claim for Damages form in the mail yesterday, and I have a few questions.

The form requests proof of loss, which in my case will be the document from my insurance company. Based on the language in the form, it seems that the driver's license of the uninsured driver will be suspended if I provide the required information.

My question is: am I required to fill out the form and send it to the Department of Licensing? And will there be any negative consequences for doing so? I noticed that there is a section in the form that indicates the information will be sent to the uninsured driver - should I be concerned about them knowing that I filed a case against them?

Thanks"
150,Is it alright for me to trespass on my neighbor’s property if I’m trying to retrieve a pet?,"My cat is strictly an indoor cat but, despite my best efforts, my family members always leave doors open and he gets out anyway. He always makes a beeline for my neighbor’s yard and jumps over the fence, meaning the only way for me to get him back is to either climb it or go around the neighbor’s house and get him, which is what I do. This has happened a few times. I live on a very busy road so I can’t just wait for him to come back— he might get hit by a car.

I always immediately leave and touch nothing except my cat. The neighbor in question is an elderly man who doesn’t speak English, and I don’t know enough of his language to ask him permission. Additionally, this almost always happens at night, and I feel it would be rude to wake him up when I could just walk in, get my cat, and leave. However, I’m nervous that this could get me into legal trouble if I’m caught. Would I have a leg to stand on in this situation?"

152,Questions about property bond,"I am currently residing in a house that has a lien on it. FIL owns house and used it as collateral for a surety bond of X amount. When the contract for the surety bond was put in front of my FIL the court ordered amount of X was increased threefold because the property was worth more than the surety. The person the bond was for failed to show to court but was apprehended on a bench warrant when they went to the surety company to fill out paperwork. 

My question is, even though the person failed to show, is it legal for this company to artificially inflate the surety to three times the court ordered amount? The court ordered amount is expensive as it is but from what I’ve read you normally only need to front 10% of a bond not 300%. Any advice is appreciated. The court is in Texas but said property is in New York."

155,"[Ontario, Canada] Unauthorized changes to credit card statement format, fraudulent charges, bank unwilling to reverse charges","I'm part of a small non-profit NGO. One of the credit cards our organization uses to purchase goods and services received a bunch of fraudulent/unauthorized charges starting three months ago. We have since cancelled and re-issued the card. Unfortunately, whoever stole our credit card information was fairly sophisticated and was also able to change how the monthly statement was delivered to us. We used to receive our monthly statement in the mail, but the fraudster was able to change the statement  format to online-only. Since we didn't get the credit card statement on paper to review every month the fraudulent charges completely slipped by.

The weirdest thing is that the bank never flagged these charges. The charges ended up being worth thousands of dollars and were for random things from Etsy and Wayfair, which we have never used the organizational credit card for. Contacting the bank was useless as they just put us on hold for hours only to tell us we're out of luck since the charges were over 30-days-old. Our organization is severely underfunded and the amount lost is setting us back quite a bit in terms of stability.

Any advice for recovering the money lost would be much appreciated! Our organizational cards are Mastercards with a bank that starts with B, ends with O, and with a commonly used name that is three letters long. Going forward we will likely implement changes to how we review finances (i.e. we will set a time aside every 30 days or less to review credit card statements) so this doesn't happen again as we absolutely can't afford losses like this without going under."

He told me straight up that my bf has to turn himself in or he will get arrested if he gets caught. And it would be settled in court.

158,What do I do?,"So my ex asked for 180 days to pay me half of his court ordered payment from his 401K. He got the check in October of last year. I know because the idiot sent it to my house and I had to give it to him.  I gave it to him the day after I received it. 180 days was up this past Wednesday. He’s had the check for six months and He hasn’t paid it.  I also know from paperwork that he had enough to pay it the day the court ordered it. I saw copies of his bank accounts bc I had to confirm I didn’t know anything about them and wasn’t associated with them in any way. 

What do I need to do? And whatever I do, will he know I did it?  I don’t want to make him mad bc we have kids and I don’t want him to take it out on them bc he’s mad at me. 

I’ve been nothing but nice to him even though he abandoned us and took all of our money/savings when he left. He cheated on me with prostitutes and there is so much more. But I’ve been nice for the sake of my children. 

It isn’t a lot of money. But to a single momma it is. Especially since I was forced to start from scratch. I was a SAHM for six years.  I lost my house, car and savings. If I hired a lawyer, I would probably pay him what I would get from the 401k. So it wouldnt be worth it. What do I do?  I want and deserve that money.  Even if not for me, but for my kids."

160,Handling the death of a parent with no will and no assets,"For context, this is in the state of Wisconsin.

My (divorced) father passed away unexpectedly earlier this year and he did not have a will or any other legal documents for handling his death.

Additionally, my Dad basically had no measurable assets besides a used car (less than 10k in value). Bank accounts were empty, no house, no other large property, etc. In fact he owes more money than he had. He was mostly paycheck to paycheck.

My family is aware that we are not responsible for any of his debts. My Dad did have life insurance and a 401k which went to beneficiaries already.

My sister and I did a free consultation with a local lawyer who basically said we can disregard all of his debts and we don't have to worry about his ""estate"" because there basically is no estate - it would be insolvent. As for his car, we were told we could take it to the DMV to have it swapped into one of our names.

My questions are:

1. Is the approach of not worrying about his ""estate"" correct? If there is nothing to put in the estate, then there just isn't an estate right? 

2. We've been told we should file his taxes. If he owes money to the IRS, who is responsible for that given that there is no money in the estate?

3. Does anyone have any info on how to handle the car? I'm skeptical the DMV would just swap the car into someone's name. Money is also still owed on the loan for the car.

Is there anything else we should know about or consider?

Thank you for your time/advice."

This relationship ended with me and my child in a battered woman’s shelter and I had to have my mother do all communication because my child’s father was so verbally abusive every conversation and visitation exchange.

Due to the couple having a child together the one spouse is trying to get the no contact order removed with no luck.  Is it possible for one spouse to leave the house and the other come into the house for a period of time?  Would that violate the order even if they don't communicate directly or indirectly?  This is mainly because the spouse with the charge is having issues with finding housing and child care is an issue.

I (19) have been with my girlfriend (17, 18 in a month) since she was a freshman. We live in southern Alabama. For a bit of context, she has been living with me for nearly 2 years. Her mother is a recently recovering heroine addict, and her father is abusive, physically abusive. She moved in with me when her mom spent all of the money for the power bill and groceries on her addiction. My gf has 5 siblings of which she is the oldest, and the youngest is 5.

Recently, her mom went to get clean. I am not sure if it was a hospital or a rehab center, but they reported her to DHR for drug use. When DHR came a few days later, 4/5 of the siblings were home alone. The 2nd oldest was off with friends. DHR heard the kids in the house alone. DHR is unaware that my gf was living with me at any point. 

They were forced to sign a safety plan, which included my gf. All 6 of them were forced to move over an hour away, away from school and their friends and into a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 family members who already lived there. The situation is uncomfortable and awful for my gf. She can no longer even go to school. Her mom has been clean on the past 2 drug tests, however. 

I, on the other hand, have been fairly lucky. I own my home, have a steady job putting me in upper-lower class, have a paid off car, keep my home clean, and food in my fridge. 

I would be fully willing to sleep on the couch to give my gf the room to herself if necessary, and I can pass a drug test.

I have been trying to do my own research but it has been incredibly difficult for me. Is there anything I can do to let my gf live with me again, if she chooses to?"

170,Jeep dealer fraud,"I have a 2013 Jeep wrangler and it broke down while traveling out of city. Coolant spilled out and Jeep overheated. We had it towed to the nearest Jeep dealer and we had to communicate over phone over distance with them because it was not in a city we live in. We were susceptible and stranded. The jeep dealer said “you’re engine is melted and you need an entire new one and coolant system and it will be $13,000.” Also, they said they would give us $1,000 for trade in value for our jeep which is a huge slap in the face cuz just the metal frame itself is worth more than that and they told us we just need to buy a new jeep. We talked to a bunch of jeep enthusiasts online and they all (and so did I) thought we were getting scammed and we ended up taking it for a second opinion with an honest guy that specializes in Jeeps and he said the engine is FINE and all we need is a new thermostat and coolant overflow tank. Which will cost a total of $900 with labor. He also said the Jeep dealer lied about their diagnostics as their report said they did a “block test”which would be literally impossible with the broken coolant tank and the liquid would leak everywhere. I’m pretty dang mad abt how we were treated and lied to and this caused us insane amounts of stress and hardship as we had only 1 car for my family for a week. Idk if anyone has any experience with this kid a thing, but wondering if I can sue the jeep dealer or make a claim at a consumer protection agency of something? There is strong evidence of fraud here. At a bare minimum I’m going to leave a bad review and get my diagnostic money refunded. Any tips greatly appreciated!!

171,Need help with probate,"My parents both passed. It’s a tragedy. My mom passed second and was in the process of taking over my dads finances. She was just about done before passing. 

In the will she said I can have the house and all her finances. Leaving out my handicapped non-coherent brother who has a guardian in a different state. 

A lawyer my parents worked with who I spoke to said I’ll need to find out the exact value of the house and find out how much money my mother has in her bank accounts. The lawyer also said I’ll need to track down my brother even though he’s not listed in the will. 

I went to a bank I know they have, although I had the death cert and will they refused to give me any information citing that I’m not listed as a beneficiary. 

I went to a bank where I know they have their mortgage (small amount left) and it was the same thing. Refused to talk to me citing that I’m not a bene listed. They won’t even let me make a payment on their mortgage to keep it from defaulting. 

So how am I supposed to file anything at probate when I can’t fetch any numbers. The lawyer said “oh well watch out for their mail and try logging in to their accounts online” I don’t have my moms passwords or anything… 

It seems like a dead end to be honest.

I’ve had my own joint account with my mom since I was a teen and I never really thought anything of it but now I want my own. Problem is that my bank requires my mom’s signature/presence to actually get me out of the account and she refuses to go because all she does is want to control my funds and take my money. She’s telling me that i’m 21 and i need to figure it out because i’m grown when I literally NEED her there. Not want. If I could get my own account I would. How do I get out of the joint account without having her sign?? I already knew she would be difficult about this but i gave it a shot with her and now idk what to do.

Got ittt. Going to a different bank. I’m pretty clueless about life obviously but tyy guys 😅"
173,Aunt from Florida Owes me Money,"Back in July of 2022, my aunt (who lives in Florida) asked to borrow $1,000 from me (I live in Kentucky) and said she would pay me back the next day. I sent her the money through Zelle, and I still have not been paid back.

She said that she couldn’t get to the bank because she hurt herself, and then because Zelle wasn’t working. She said she would pay me back when I saw her in person. I visited her home in September of 2022 to celebrate her granddaughter‘s 15th birthday, and I found out that the money was used for the birthday party. Other people said that they also hadn’t been paid back their money and I realized they weren’t going to pay me back.

When I said I could tell I wasn’t going to be paid back, I got screamed at and they said they had my money. They blamed me saying they didn’t have food for the birthday party because I wanted my money back so badly. Spoiler: they didn’t have my money.

It’s now April 2023 and they said they would pay me back with their tax return money. They said that they filed back in January and still hadn’t gotten anything. Of course, they have no intention of paying me back.

Can I sue them for the money they owe me even though they live in a different state than me? How do I sue them?"
174,How enforceable is the non-compete that I stupidly signed,"I stupidly signed a non-compete with my current employer in New Jersey that states if I seek employment within 20 miles of the office at which I currently work I am liable for 2x my annual salary plus annual stipend & benefits paid to them within 90 days, which would add up to over $120,000. I learned my lesson with signing this sort of thing, I wasn’t really expecting to have an issue but I’m seriously considering going back to my old job which is within the 20 mile radius and I’m wondering if this is something for which I need to worry about my current employer actually going after me. I doubt something like this is seriously enforceable but I need to be sure if I make this transition."
175,Purchasing a small strip from neighbor ... what is the right process? (WA state),"## Background: 

this is in Washington State, Kitsap County, and we're outside of any city limits (barely but enough to not need to worry about that). 

---

## tldr; 

I may be purchasing a <>5' x <>60' strip of land that borders the front of my property that my neighbor currently owns. (much longer explanation below)

---

## Question: I haven't gone through this type of piecemeal property process before, only whole property purchases. What is the right way to go about filing an amendment to show my modified property line if a deal goes through?

I assume I'll need to file through a local property lawyer. In which case I'd appreciate pointers on how to find the right type of lawyer and any idea of the filing cost.

---

## Long Story:

When I bought my house (2016) I was never informed by the various parties that the alleyway was privately owned and I only have access to my driveway via an easement. The alley used to be a county road but was purchased / privatized by a neighbor at some point many years ago. Neighbor who owns it is also responsible for maintenance and they do an ok job so I'd never even thought about it being private. 

*(yeah, if this wasn't so far from the purchase date I'd be giving the realtor, seller, and whoever a piece of my mind)*

Getting more frustrating in the same discovery, I found out that the easement ends at the edge of my driveway. The drive is at the edge of my front border so I can reach the end of the easement without being legally allowed to drive past it even though my front yard goes farther down the alleyway. Neighbor past that point has an easement but I don't. 

Even better (worse), the owner of my house before me apparently got legal on the alley owner and they sued each other. And the prior owner of my house lost to the point where a 5' wide strip that -looks- like the front of my property is technically the alley even though it's higher than the alley and grown with yard plants. The neighbor owns not just the alley but the strip between my legal border and the alley. 

I'd been (before discovering all of this) planning to fence my front yard in such a way that I can use the front of the property for guest parking. Needless to say ... I currently can't. 

The prior owner of my house is obviously long out of the picture. The neighbor he sued passed away shortly before I moved here. But his wife still has a very bad memory of the whole legal thing and ended up saying she wouldn't give me easement or access to that 5' strip (and no, she doesn't do anything with it ... actually her lack of maintenance meant I took down the original fence that was on the very edge of my yard border because plants damaged it). 

However she did float the idea that I might be able to purchase it from her. I haven't had liquid funds up until now so had to back burner it. 

Assuming we can come to a dollar agreement, and it includes the easement so we can use it for parking, I want to make sure I know the process I need to follow."
176,I'm being verbally and sexually harassed by my neighbor,"I(36ftm) live in a government funded low income apartment for disabled people, in texas, and for the past 8 months I have been verbally and sexually harassed by my neighbor. He follows me, has threatened me with violence on multiple occasions, has made derogatory comments about my genitalia, threatened to kill my boyfriend, tried to lure my bf outside of the building to be attacked, stolen deliveries from my doorstep, cornered me in the elevator more that once, I have had to call the cops on him 3 times, but they won't do anything. It is strictly a violation of the lease to act in a threatening way toward another resident, but the housing manager refuses to do anything about it. What legal recourse do I have to make them do something about this lunatic before he decides to just get a gun and shoot me?"
177,Self-Representing - Petition under California probate code 17200.7,"Am considering self-representing to file one or more petitions under California probate code 17200.7, which includes allowing beneficiaries to petition the court to compel a successor trustee to produce the Trust documents, and allows beneficiaries to petition to remove the successor trustee or appoint a new one, amongst other things.

It will likely be LA Superior Court.  I am physically in northern California. 

I'm still calling law firms but getting the sense most want a huge retainer.  $10k seems ballpark, which I can't afford.

One attorney indicated at least as far as the successor trustee failing to produce the trust document(s), that is really pretty cut and dried, my case is very strong, and no lawyer would agree to represent a successor trustee who was refusing to provide the trust documents to the beneficiaries of the trust.   I asked whether, as far as the petition goes, I would be foolish to try and self-represent and she said no, not foolish.

I've sent a very strongly worded demand letter already and am gearing up for next steps, anticipating the successor trustee will either ignore me or again refuse to provide information.  If he isn't doing something unethical, he is giving every appearance of it as well as being incompetent in understanding what is required of him as successor trustee.  

Guy literally thinks he can just send me a check noted as inheritance and that is all the documentation I need. 

There is so much more to it, but that isn't why I'm posting.

My question is:

There is no form for filing a petition.  I did find the ""pleading paper"" that lays out the header for legal documents filed with the court, but I need to look at some samples of petitions and get a sense for what should be included in the body of the petition and how it should be structured.   Does anyone here know where I might find that?

Also, if anyone has experience self-representing in probate court I'd be interested to hear how it went for you.

Thanks in advance!"
178,"Bought a renovated home with an open permit in CA, and the work done didn’t pass inspection. Is the contractor obligated to bring it up to code?","There was some structural work and electrical work done by a CA licensed B- Contractor, and as title says it didn’t pass inspection. I’m assuming the contractor would be liable to do the repairs as his work was not up to code/done incorrectly, does that sound right? 

The seller of the property was the client of the contractor and they aren’t being very kind to us. Do we have the right to go directly to the contractor and demand the work be fixed?

The Warranty section of the contract between the Contractor and the sellers states “…the work will be free from defects.”"
179,Can I remove a fence without HOA approval?," In the summary of covenants and restriction of my Homeowners Association, there is mention in regards to removal of trees, but it only mentions requiring review and approval by the committee prior to *beginning installation* in regards to a fence. I live in a 20+ year old neighborhood and never hear of any “problems” from the HOA, and they do not enforce many of the things in the covenants such as campers in the driveway, mailbox standards, etc, but I am posting out of curiosity. 

Does the phrase “any construction or alteration of any structure which takes place on any Lot or to any Living Unit” apply to the complete *removal* of a fence?

Other phrases include “No structure shall be commenced, erected, placed or moved onto or permitted to remain on any Properties, nor shall any existing structure upon any Properties be altered in any way which materially changes the exterior appearances, thereof, nor shall any new use be commenced, all unless plans and specifications (including a description of any new use) therefore shall have been submitted to and approved in writing”"
180,"Sexually abused by masseur, what should I do?","I was just sexually abused by a masseur in an airport lounge in Los Angeles. He touched me inappropriately and tried to give me oral sex. I left in shock, went in the plane, and then decided to cancel my trip and contact the authorities.

I have no idea what I should be doing, how to contact attorneys or lawyers? I did reach out to the police and cops are with me right now but don't know if I should press charges because it'll end up a 'he said / I said'. Never been to Los Angeles, don't know what to do. Could really use some help... "
181,"My neighbour, whose driveway is parallel to mine, placed wooden planters in my driveway, blocking me from exiting my car. What can I do? [Quebec]","We have constant legal problems with this neighbour and none of them are ever resolved because they’re just minimal enough to not be worth talking to a barrister about.

But I’m really annoyed with her being brassy enough to put wooden planters in my driveway. They have fallen and the cars have been scratched, if I need to drive towards the back of my driveway I cannot exit my car except through the trunk, and she didn’t ask to put them there.

They’re on what is legally my property.

Can I use them as a place to put my cigarette butts or something? There are no flowers in them, just dirt. Occasionally they fall over and block my driveway entirely. Can I put flowers in them? If I can’t get rid of them, can I at least make them useful? 

Since they’ve been on my property for months now, can I just have them thrown out?

If I ask her to get rid of them, she will scream at me and make a huge scene. I’ve had to tow multiple cars from our driveway that were her guests, she’s placed random dumpsters in our driveway at 6 am without telling us… I’m sick of letting her petty behaviour slide and at minimum, I just want the planters gone.

I’ve tried moving them back onto her property line, and she’s moved them back into my driveway.

**Edit:**

A comment disappeared asking if I have documented previous incidents. The answer is yes, however in Canada our documentation is limited as both parties need to consent to recordings. So our cameras only point at whoever is at our front door and the very end of our driveway. All of our neighbours were informed about the camera installation and reassured we were not recording their property.

She has moved the planters out of view of the cameras. I have the Timestamp app and am considering taking photos twice a day to prove they have been abandoned on our property. I’m not sure if this would be worth my time, though. The local authorities have other things to do than care about her planters on my property - I even recently called 911 to report a downed power line that posed a danger to anyone walking on the sidewalk. The dispatcher told me “I wish Hydro-Quebec (city’s power company) would stop telling people to call us. It’s their problem.”

The cameras have captured other things such as her letting people park in our driveway, her verbally confronting me while I was standing on my porch by the front door (because we towed her illegal worker in our driveway), and her animals wandering onto our property.
By illegal, I mean that permission from the city to do construction was not obtained. If anyone wants to make physical changes/do renovations or construction, you need a permit from the city which protects the workers from being paid unfairly and ensures that safety measures are being taken. She doesn’t do that. We wanted to report this to the city, but we’re afraid of retaliation. She already tried to kill my dog once prior to installing the cameras."

183,Was fired without cause or reasoning for reporting an unregistered work truck.,"Long story short. I was a Refer Driver for a company for almost 2 years. Never had any issues with attendance or work related issues. Always got along with coworkers. No sit downs or talks about performance. In my opinion I was a valued employee. Even had some PTO coming up I was excited about.

Since October 2022 the company I worked for has been making me drive an illegal commercial vehicle. I attempted to contact my managers in the proper chain of command about getting this inspection done so I would not be pulled over or issued a ticket.

Over the course of 6 months this issue continually kept getting pushed off. When I began to push my GM more about it he lied to me and told me we were waiting on a part and service.

When I asked what part and service we are waiting on he never responded. I have documents and evidence of all of this. Even going back to January detailing how management was not responding to me when I approached others within the company that may have weight.

The service rack was also becoming detached and was at a point of coming off the vehicle while driving.

FF to last month when I began to contact folks in our HQ (out of state). This occurred on my Saturday shift. 

I come back to work the next week and after working for 6 hours my GM asked to talk to me.

He at first was asking how things were (that day my dog had a blood transfusion and I was dealing with that.)

That was when he mentioned that the act of contacting HQ went over him and he got in trouble due to my action. He was frustrated with me that I was trying to get some action moving on my concern.

Then it switched gears and he tried to get me to quit my job. After I told him I wasn’t going to quit he said ‘Well then we should go our separate ways.’

I asked if he was firing me and he said yes. When I asked for HR or my manager being present he declined. When I asked for the reason he did not give me one.

FF to today. I am still learning they are operating the vehicle illegally on expired tags & that HR is present at the location so they must see this also.

Would this be worth pursuing? I have plenty of evidence of negligence & feel this is a retaliation against me for going over my GM due to their inaction.

Have contacted the DOT, EEOC & an employment lawyer. I also filed unemployment that day.

Thanks to all that read this and assist me in my questions."

Additonal information:  friend has not seen the apartment.  The landlord claims to no longer live in the state.  Friend was able to get in a call with him where he reiterated that the deposit is non-refundable.  The whole thing smells like a scam.  What can we do to get the $800 deposit back?"

186,Failed by the school and regret trusting them after bringing my concerns to them! Can I do anything??,"I am looking for info on if I can hold my daughters school accountable in any way or what to do. And YES I KNOW they r NOT the only ones who are at fault here, and is some peoples eyes maybe not at all idk.
To sum it up as short as possible, I had an agreement with the school(vice principal & ROTC instructors) where she was supposed to be reporting to the ROTC room over her lunch period due to high concerns that I had with her activities that I knew about, where I saw it going, why I was as concerned as I was and make sure that they understood that certain things have been ongoing concerns in regards to her and told them the seriousness of this with example of past. I felt the VP was downplaying my concerns and not truly not understanding them for what they were, I expressed that to him and told him that she would not return if that was the case. His tone changed and we came to the agreement of her lunch time being at rotc and if not still reporting there I would be notified. Even spoke in person to the rotc instructors shortly after this and everything was clear. 
Now I find out that she hasn’t been reporting for lunch there for MINIMUM of the last 3 weeks and she was even leaving school property to go and engage in activities she knew better than! 
She is 15 and a sophomore in high school. Her and this other individual knew they were not to be in contact still with each other. He is a Jr and 17 and has a history of being mentally, and emotionally abusive to females, as well as trying to keep them hostage and so so much more. When the info got brought to me I said I needed proof before I could just believe it… well I received it. The school also knew I had concerns of this specific individual and y and how I knew what I did. 
Anyhow,they went off campus during lunch time when she isn’t supposed to be off campus period, but no one notified me either that she wasn’t reporting there for lunch any longer! We had an agreement! I made sure it was in place for a reason! 
Now charges have been filed on the 17 year old male due to the fact my 15 year old is not of age to consent. They both knew the possible consequences of their actions, and I only continued to allow my daughter to go there due to me trusting our agreement would be met! They failed us! Do I have a leg to stand on or what can I do if anything?"
187,Anonymous posting on Facebook,"Throw away account

TL;DR: Is there anything legally that can be done if as an admin of a group, I share the names of anonymous posters?

I created a Facebook group calling out a business for being shady. I did not realize just how bad it was and a bunch of people joined the group and were really bashing and bad mouthing not only the business but also the owner specifically. 

To no one's surprise other than mine, the owner filed a lawsuit for defamation against me for starting the group. I did not say anything bad personally, but was just allowing anyone to post anything in the group. I had anonymous posting turned on. 

The business owner is willing to drop the lawsuit against me if I give him the names of the people who posted anonymously. At this point I can not afford to have to fight the lawsuit, I started the group because I had been dealing with the business for almost 9 months over an issue I could not afford to fix. (The fix was also under a warranty).

My question is: Am I legally allowed to share the names of the anonymous posters. Is there any legal or civil action that the anonymous posters can take against me if I share their names?

I have searched and searched and searched. I have attempted to contact anyone and everyone I possibly can. I can not find an answer anywhere. I also can not find a way to contact Facebook directly. I've tried META and they are no help. Does anyone know if there is someway to actually contact Facebook?"

189,I was punched in the face by a road rager,"Help, 
(Sorry this is kinda long) 
this happened a few days back when a driver randomly started tailgating me in traffic (yes I was going the speed limit) I tried switching lanes to let him pass but he began to side swipe and brake check me, I slowed down and switched lanes so he’d leave me alone but It kept getting worse. At some point he slowed all the way down to get closer to me, rolled his windows down, and started waving for me to get closer to his vehicle so he could side swipe me again. Sometime later when traffic came to a stop he waited till I got closer to his vehicle then started throwing stuff at me, then when I stopped at the red light he came out and started smashing my windows, I kept pressing the lock button on my car but somehow he managed to open the door and punched me multiple times, the first initial punch cut my forehead open and It started gushing out blood (gave me a deep cut) I told him to please stop Multiple times, he eventually did and I drove into the nearest gas station out of panic, I did not get his license plate and I have been pissed off for the last couple days because I can’t do anything about it. I tried reporting it to non emergency but I haven’t got a response.

190,Need advice on retrieving my things from my moms house.,"Hi this is my first post so please let me know if I do something wrong.

A few weeks ago I had a blow up with my mother and had to leave my home where I have lived for the last few years. I left and spent the last few weeks in a VA hospital psych ward to get some help for some things. I am now out and living with my son, however my things are still at my mothers house. I want to go back and get them but they are not on good terms with me and I am worried about even going there alone. My son is going to get a Civil Standby from the local police to accompany us to my old home, and get my belongings. I am also worried that they are not going to allow me to get things that belong to me. I am a blind disabled veteran, I have lived in that house for the last 12 years, and I am in the state of Missouri. Is there anything I should do legally to make this easier for me? I am trying to make this as civil and smooth as possible, but I do not know what to do if they say I can't have something that is mine. They have already told my son they have started throwing my things away and that certain things are not mine that are.

Thank you again."

194,Implications of paying a Collection Bill?," Long story short: an urgent care facility charged me for a deductible my insurance fully covered. I received a bill and reported it to my insurance, which confirmed they took care of it. They didn't. I received a collection bill notification. After several phone calls (and hours on hold) between the insurance company, the facility, and the collection agency I just want this to go away

I'm so annoyed to the point that I want to pay the negligible amount ($35) to make the thorn go away and report the facility. Before I do, I wanted to know if there would be any damaging implication for paying the collection fee. Would it impact my credit? Show up on future background checks, etc?"
195,"Apartment Complex not maintaining building, and I'm anxious about spending the 200$ for a legal consultation if it turns out I don't have a case.","I'm a first time renter, and have been at this property for \~3 years. Largely things have been fine, I like it well enough, but since the beginning there has been a pattern of management being unwilling to help with issues in the apartment. In the first three months after I moved in, the toilet flooded without warning and I ended up with poop water in three different rooms before my girlfriend discovered the problem. To be clear, the toilet wasn't backed up, they share a pipe system with other units or something. Management responded when I called, fixed the issue, but didn't do anything about the standing water. When I asked what I was meant to do, the maintenance worker told me, and I quote, ""get a mop and a bucket."" At the time, I just didn't know better, and tried to clean it, but after an hour realized I wasn't equipped to do so, and called maintenance again. This time they handled it, but I'm laying this out because it's just par for the course.

More recently in February, the roof in the master bedroom began leaking during heavy rainfall in San Diego. When I say leaking, I mean it was raining in my bedroom.  Just pouring water from several different spots down the walls and making bubbles in the paint and soaking into the carpet. Buckets  were no use, because the water wasn't dripping straight down, it was running down the wall. Kinda hard to get a bucket under that. I called the emergency maintenance line and informed them of the problem and was laughed at. I was told that it was ridiculous to expect them to come out while it was raining. At the time I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously, but I thought that it was more or less reasonable that they couldn't do anything while it was raining, so I waited the night out. When I called the next day they said they'd open a ticket. I told them that they needed to look at it now, because it was forecasted to rain again that night, and so much water was getting in that I believed the problem would escalate quickly if they didn't deal with it then. Predictably, I was ignored and they sent me a ticket by Email. I don't have it in front of me, but I think they had me waiting 48 hours, however the morning of, I got an email saying my ticket had been closed. They never even came to look at it. I ran in circles with this process for nearly TWO MONTHS before they even came to look at it. I called, I emailed, I went to the office, but they just wouldn't show up. (Although, somewhere in there they did tell me they were coming to replace my windows, (tf?) but that date came and went too without them showing up or following up.)

When they finally did look at it, it turned out that there was a soccer ball blocking a drain on the roof, causing water to pool and leak in. If they had just dealt with it then, it would have been over with, but they just wouldn't come. Now, the entire wall has rotted through, and into the next bedroom, so we've been moved to another apartment while the tear the wall out and change the carpet and floor boards, (one of them had warped so bad the it had practically rotated 90 degrees under our feet,) Since then, they've failed to show up as scheduled twice, and haven't provided me with a date at which they'll have the work finished. I work from home, and am currently trying to work on a 2Mpbs connection, which sucks, but my roommate, whom also works at home, has literally had the power shut off without warning, and then they up and left for lunch without alerting her to what they had done. I ended up running an extension cord to the kitchen to get her setup working, but jesus, seriously?  

The more I type, the less anxious I fell about contacting a lawyer, but I'm basically stupid, so any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated. <3

PS: There's definitely more too, like offering to send help moving the bedroom and then just not doing that, and my girlfriend crying her eyes out because she doesn't have access to any of the things that help her with her severe depression, ect, but I did my best to be concise. Again, I called and emailed over and over and over, I wasn't complicit in the lack of communication, and have pictures, phone records, & Emails."
196,Can I trademark a company name that I plan to use in the future?,"As the title says, is there anyway to trademark a name of a company that I have in mind without actually owning a business or even planning to anytime soon? I only want to keep the name safe and in a few years, maybe 3-5 to be exact, I plan on actually using the name for a business. I live in the US, California more specifically, although when I do start my business it will be in a different state."
197,Can a landlord take a tenants last months rent and ask the other tenants to pay for there rent? Even if the roommate already paid the rent with his last? And the roommates are on the same lease.,My roommate was telling me he paid for the other roommates rent because he moved out in the middle of the lease and even though the landlord was paid the last rent when the other guy moved in he still has to pay rent.
198,Am I entitled to a refund from Southwest??,"I would greatly appreciate any input. We had a flight in which the return flight was cancelled 3 hours prior to take off. No delay, no warning, just straight cancelled. We only found out because we were actively logged into the SW app and constantly updating, otherwise the text for cancellation didn’t come until 90 minutes after that! We would have been at the airport by then.

Anyway to make a long story short we found the only flight we could find on the SW app that goes back to Midway. This flight unlike our other flight was not straight through, and it actually turned out to be a 9 hour flight with several stops. The thing is we HAD to get home so we booked the flight. $1800 for 4 people to travel a distance of 2.5 hours on a plane. 

When we got to the airport we went to SW customer service who stated they could not refund us our flight for the one we booked or the one that was cancelled, and that we would need to contact SW customer service by phone for assistance.

So we get home and call them up the next day. They apologized and promised us a full refund for the flight we booked for $1800 since that’s the flight they likely would have put us on anyway. We were told it would be fully refunded but will take 7-10 business days to process. Great! We thanked them and went about our business.

10 days later the only “refund” we got back to our SW card was two $5 amounts. Confused we give them a call, and we were told that actually nope we won’t be getting a refund! They said they decided to let us keep the points and refunded us the taxes for the flight, but they will not be refunding the $1800 they promised us.

The fact we had to contact them and they didn’t even notify us of this “change” is enraging! When we complained we were told “ sorry case closed there’s nothing we can do, contact the better business bureau”

Do I have a case here? If they explicitly told me they would refund the money and without notifying us decided they wouldn’t? At the very least I think we are entitled to a refund for the flight that was cancelled. How would I go about getting a copy of that recorded phone call? Thank you for any advice!"
199,Fairly certain somebody stole my $260 Airpod Pros; is a location on my iPhone legitimate evidence?,"So as the title says, I think my Airpods were stolen. I'm in high school and I'm a track runner, and I went onto the field with my AirPods in. I ran some warmups with them still in, then I know for a fact I put them back in my case and set them on the ground near my backpack. Yes I know that was a dumb idea but hey I'm definitely learning that now. So I come back to look for them about an hour later and they're just straight up gone.

So I went to the ""Find My"" app which tracks everything you have that is apple, but it had said that they were last seen about 20 minutes ago (when i first looked at it) right there on the field with my phone. Long story short, I tried a lot of things and I can fairly confidently assure you they aren't on the field. I looked for about an hour and checked the app again only for it to say they were still last seen right there on that field at 4pm.

So It's currently 6:29 PM when I'm writing this, and it still says it was last seen on the field at 3:58 PM. So i'm like 95% sure that someone took them home with them and it just hasn't updated yet. I have them set to missing on the app which makes them not connect to anyone else and will notify me whenever they are opened.

So this all got me thinking; if the location updates to someone's house and they claim they don't have it, to what extent can I get cops involved? I have the digital receipts of when I bought them, and they actually have an engraving of my nickname on them. So I have lots of proof that they are mine. But if they claim they don't have them but the location is showing that is inside their house, does that have any value to law enforcement?

Here's pretty much what I'm trying to do here if the law permits. First off if the location updates to some random person's house, I'll go there and politely ask for my airpods and show the receipt. The legal advice I'm asking for after that is that if they refuse, I'll call the cops and show that I have my iPhone reporting that my airpods are inside that person's house. Can they use that as a reason to search them?

Yes I'm aware house searches are pretty serious and typically require warrants, but I'm aware there's certain scenarios where a warrantless search is allowed, which I'm not an expert on. And heck if I were to need to, certainly this wouldn't be enough evidence to show to a judge to issue a warrant, right?"
200,Wrong Lease End Date on Lease Renewal Offer,"I received a lease renewal offer 1/24 stating my lease was expiring 4/30 and I would have to choose between one of their new renewal options or switch to month-to-month. Its a signed document, though I only have a pic of it. I found a new apartment, signed the lease, gave the old complex a notice only to receive an email stating my lease actually ends 6/30 so I would have to stay or break the lease.

Called the office, they acknowledge they sent the renewal notice but my lease says 6/30 so according to them that is what matters.

Am I in the right here? I know I should have verified the lease before moving but I went off the document they sent me."
201,"[FL] My former landlord sold the property I was renting because I agreed to leave. I only ""agreed"" because the buyer issued me an eviction notice prior to the property ever being sold.","Our story will take place in Tallahassee, Florida. On March 12th, 2022, I received a ""Termination of Tenancy"" notice from- let's call her, Kunt. At the time, Kunt was my landlord's roommate, and my (duplex) neighbor's mother. Prior to receiving this notice, my neighbor has frequently spoken to me about how horrible and manipulative her mother was. Kunt shows up at my door and hands me this notice, explains that my landlord is retiring and has sold the property to her. She offered a very generous amount of time to move out (May 15th, 2022), and even an incentive to move out early. Up to this point, I had been living at this property for probably about three years. 

Not particularly relevant legally, but for some context:
My landlord is incredible. I'd had many issues with my mental health back then, and every time my landlord was so very forgiving about late rent payments and any drama I caused them. At the time, I had also just broken up with my partner, who moved into that house when I first got it. I loved that house, and considered buying it on multiple occasions. Needless to say, with everything going on at the time, I simply cried about the situation and cursed the forces that be for giving me such a rough time.

I had assumed that the sale was a done deal, and never bothered to ask my landlord about it. Fast forward to now. Comparatively, I am living in a far worse place with far more people than I'd ever wanted in my home. I've had several of my belongings stolen, damaged, and destroyed. I had to sell a lot of very valued things in order to even have space to live. Despite all that, I am doing well for myself. The only unfortunate thing is my living situation! I'm having to move, now for the third time, and thought I'd message my former landlord and offer my appreciation while I was in the headspace of having to move (quietly hoping she would potentially know of any affordable places to live in my area).

Well! My landlord texts me back shorty after asking, ""What retirement? What eviction notice?"" For those who can't pick up on context clues (or those who neglected to read the title), THE EVICTION NOTICE WAS FAKE. Kunt lied to my landlord by telling her that I was okay with moving out given sufficient time and she never thought to question it. According to my landlord, Kunt signed a contract to (if I understood correctly) buy the house on May 11th, but the house was never sold until April 30th. The notice I was given specifically states that the property had been sold to her, signed by her and everything. I even kept it for sentimental value!

Basically, I'm wanting to know if we have a case, and if so, what could either of us ever even hope to get out of this? I don't imagine she could be forced to return the house for buying it under false pretenses, but that would be my dream scenario. I'm young and completely ignorant legally. I made the mistake of telling my former neighbor all this (again, her daughter), and now Kunt knows I'm onto her. I assured her I was too broke and busy moving to a different state to take legal action, but that was only in the hope that she wouldn't preemptively start preparing a defense. I want justice for myself, my landlord, and my neighbor (who, I failed to mention is a single mother. I suspect this situation arose due to the mother wanting to manipulate her daughter and control her, and her granddaughter's life) I will take any and all advice here. Thank you generous redditors so very much for this and everything you do on this sub. Even if my situation is a bust, you're making a difference."
202,"My Parents are divorced and I feel like my mother is trying to ""collect dirt"" on my dad.","Hello, the situation I'm dealing with involves my parents' divorce, and my mother's behavior towards my father afterwards. I am a minor and reside with my father, although I still spend some time with my mother occasionally. However, during these visits, I have noticed that my mother often asks probing questions that imply she is seeking information about my father. As a result, I have made it clear to her that I will not discuss my father or any details related to him with her. Nevertheless, I feel as though she has become more adept at disguising her inquiries, making it difficult to talk about how I'm doing without mentioning my father. I hardly text her anymore because of this.

This has been going on for around a year now, and recently, it appears that my mother's behavior has become more aggressive. She has been taking photographs of the addresses on our mail, which my father has sent to his girlfriend's residence due to safety concerns with the mail system at our apartment. Furthermore, while my mother was talking to me at the entrance of our apartment, I noticed her taking pictures of the interior. When I requested that she delete the photos, she declined, refused to show me the camera roll, and left.

I am worried about any potential negative consequences that my father may face due to my mother's actions. Is there any advice you can offer on what steps I can take or what I can tell my father to ensure our safety?"
203,What is the process of terminating my lease (uninhabitable apartment in VA),"Hi. I’m currently living as a sublease in an apartment. The sublease goes until the end of june, i already paid for April so I just have may and June left to pay for but I want to break the lease early because there are squirrels living in the crawl space area between my ceiling and the roof. 

It has gotten to the point that they broke a hole in the ceiling through the wall. They are loud constantly, running around and crawling at the ceiling. I believe it is definitely a health violation.

I have told the landlord about it many times, called and texted and sent pictures and videos. I started talking to him about it the beginning of February, it’s now mid April and the problem has only gotten worse. He only has his handyman come to try to fix it and patch up the hole but it doesn’t work and he wont hire an outside company. 

I am planning on breaking the lease 2 months early as it is uninhabitable at this point. 

What is the process of doing this? Do I just give him written notice and leave and stop paying? Or is there something else I have to do to like “break the lease” or declare it uninhabitable. I have a ton of photo and video evidence as well as many text messages to my landlord. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated thank you!!!!"
204,Insurance company is denying mental health claims due to televisit doctor’s location. Anything I can do?,"I signed up with a virtual mental health company a few months ago. The first bill is finally becoming due, and the insurance company is denying all claims as they are saying provider is out of network. The doctor who treated me is licensed in the state that I am located in, but was located in a different state at the time of treatment. The mental health company told me I was in network with my insurance prior to treatment, as they only see patients whose insurance they accept. I also have emails from the mental health company stating my copay will be $20. I have already submitted a written appeal to the insurance company. Is there anything else I can do?"
205,Can I call my Landlords lender to tell him of his neglect?," 

I didn't realize that property investors like my landlord exist. His behavior and his language can be misogynistic; he gaslights, or completely fails to communicate.

We just moved into the apartment in July 2022. From the beginning, we started noticing issues. There was a horrible smell coming from the kitchen cabinets, mold, and roaches, just to name a few. I have documented all issues and kept all correspondence and pictures.

While attempts to remove the mold have been made and the cabinet was replaced, we still have many unresolved issues: a roach problem (mainly the garage) that we have been tracking, a broken window, and an unsanitary garbage common area that is roach infested. We are not hopeful that we can work this out on our own, so we need guidance.

We paid out of pocket for a home inspection in January that revealed multiple leaks and mold in the home and garage. Code enforcement was called regarding the leaks, and while some attempts to address this have been made, we still have many outstanding issues and have not heard from him since March 29th.

Most recently, we emailed our landlord requesting clarification about his understanding about what a security deposit is. During early conversations about mold and smell in our kitchen, he made a comment that he had spent a lot of our deposit already. We are concerned that our deposit may not be refunded to us.

Our attempts to reach out to our landlord have been trying. He has a Google number and at times does not accept calls. And he doesn't list his physical address; instead, he hides it behind a California privacy law that protects elected officials. I am pretty sure he isn't an elected office. Google search returns nothing of that nature.

208,Advice Needed - Tenants Rights,"

We live in a 4-plex apartment. Since February we have been receiving messages from our landlord stating that someone is complaining about weed smoke in the units. Last time they said they would charge all 4 units a violation fee if they got another complaint. Well today we finally got that message stating that someone complained again and they have now charged us a violation fee. It’s already showing on our account as due and we’re just wondering if this is something they can reasonably do or if there is anything we can do to prove we are not. We sent a message asking if there was anyway we can avoid this and we got the most insincere detached response.

209,Apartments Application of Rules,"Nashville TN

Hello, I currently live in an apartment and the leasing office is finding me for breaking an apartment rule. However, there is a good number of other residents that are also breaking the same rule and they have not had the rule applied to them. Is there something that can be done about the rules not being applied fairly to everyone? 

For context about the rule, it’s about strorage on the balcony. I had some chairs that were not patio chairs and received a fine because it’s not patio furniture, however there are other residents with non-patio furniture out that I just spoke with and they did not receive the fine or anything about it. I live on the bottom floor, and the other people live on the second floor, so I feel like I’m being picked on since I’m on the bottom. 

Thank you to anyone that can help here, my google searching keep taking me to fair housing rights on discrimination and I’m not sure if that’s the direction I need to be in as it doesn’t feel racial or due to disability/health."
210,Landlord Asking for a Second Payment of First and Last Month's Rent.,"Basically what the title says. I rent in Washington State. When we moved in we got a 6 month lease and paid first and last month's rent plus a 3500 dollar deposit ($1000 of that was non-refundable pet fee, no idea if this is relevant). We asked him for another year lease on the property and when he brought the paperwork he had another first and last months rent payment on the lease agreement. Rent didn't go up at all.  He's not raising the actual monthly rent it in any way. I'm just wondering since we already paid first and last 6 months ago how this would apply? And am I misunderstanding how lease agreements work? Is this legal?"
211,Protecting Assets (house) from Medicaid Estate Recovery,"I posted a comment in another forum about my situation and was referred here by other posters.

I am a 54 year old woman. I work as a lunch lady in an elementary school and I make about $24k/year. I am raising an 8 year old granddaughter and we are in the process of adoption. My 14 year old granddaughter (via kinship, not biological) has just come back to live with me as well. The girls will qualify for Medicaid until they're 18 regardless of our situation or their status living here (ie; adopted, foster care, kinship care, whatever.) I am also on Medicaid at present.

As I said, I'm 54 and will be 55 later this year. I own a home that will be entirely mortgage-free in just a couple of years. The Medicaid Estate Recovery Act kicks in at age 55. I have been planning to decline Medicaid coverage before I turn 55 in order to protect the house. (They SAY they don't ""take the house"" but as your home is the only asset you can have when you're on Medicaid, that's a deceptive thing to say!)

Anyway, my family has been poor or working poor for generations and I want to leave at least a LITTLE something for my granddaughters so I am going to have to get off Medicaid.

I don't qualify for health insurance through my employer because I technically work two part-time positions under two different programs. I went to the HealthCare Marketplace to price getting insurance on my own. OMFG. $519/month for the lowest priced plan and my annual out of pocket will be $18,000. It's almost as if it's priced to exactly cost everything I make so I have to stay on Medicaid.

My other thought was to just go without and use the free clinics for what I can, pay out of pocket if I need simple things and declare bankruptcy if I incurr more catastophic (to me) medical bills.

A commentor on the other forum suggested putting the house in my granddaughter's name but I've seen that be a really bad move. Another mentioned a trust but I don't really have the assets to actually form a trust (I mean, seriously, I'm on MEDICAID!)

Is a trust something that can be done basically only for a house - one that's really only worth about $150,000? Is it really pricey to do or is there such a thing as legal aid for this kind of thing? I am in Des Moines, IA where we do have a law school and a legal clinic but I was kind of under the impression that they really only help with criminal cases.

Can anyone give me an idea of what to do here? I'm normally very in favor of taxes and being responsible for one's self because we all have to do our part but those insurance prices really pissed me off and I'd have no ill feeling if I had to file a bankruptcy over medical expenses if it came to it just to make sure this house doesn't go to the state over something like that."
212,Public school released child to estranged parent (MD),"Today, the school my cousin's son attends, released him to his estranged father that he hasn't seen in a year. The school has a listed of approved people that can pick a child up from school. The father is not on that list. He simply showed up to school with a birth certificate and his ID and they release the child to him. The father is now not returning any phones calls. 

They never filed for custody, so I believe they have joint custody by default. Is there anything to be done about this? Was the school supposed to let him take the child?"
213,What do I do about my grandma's elderly roomate abusing her?,"My grandma lives with a man who has kinda been her boyfriend for the past 8 years. She's 60s and he's 80s, they still live together in an apartment but are no longer ""together"" so now he's just a roomate. He's starting to show signs of dementia and he's becoming very verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive. 
My grandma just had a total hip replacement and pelvic reconstruction and has been wheelchair bound since November. She can walk a little bit with a walker now, but he replaced her old walker with a new one and now he is saying since he bought it he can take it away even though she literally relies on it to do basic functions like use the bathroom and grab snacks. He is hiding her stuff from her and continually harassing her as she's just laying in bed watching TV. 

I am her PoA and main caretaker, but I live an hour away and visit once or twice a week to make sure she has everything she needs and gets any help she can while I'm there. She even has a pet bird who she loves, but he is also denying her access to him.

While she was in rehab after her surgery. He resigned their lease in only his name. So as of this month she is legally just an occupant and is afraid if she does anything to anger him or get him taken away. She will be without a home.

214,Collecting fountain coins and repaying the state,"So in the last few months I've heavily gotten into coin collecting. It makes me very happy and I see a lot of different variations of pennies, nickels and dimes. I have even found a few wheat pennies. I want to expand the areas that I collect and start fishing out of fountains. I wouldn't necessarily be stealing them because I would be getting a hold of the parks and rec for my area and paying them the same amount in the coins that I find in cash or a check or something to that nature. I'd basically be buying coins out of face value from fountains. Of course! I'm going to be doing this with permission from my city or state but I wanted ideas on how I would go about this. Anyone knows if there is a permit for this. I know the coins that get collected in the fountains usually go to charity so of course I would repay what I take cent for cent. Any questions, suggestions or thoughts?"
215,[CO] Is there a legal limit homeowners insurance can take to payout?,"Over two months ago I had to file an insurance claim with my HOA. The claim was accepted, but payment for repairs has yet to be sent.

My wife and I have had to fund all repairs out of pocket, and this is creating significant financial hardships on us. 

1. Because the HOA won't give us the insurance payment until after repairs are complete.

2. They just now informed us insurance has not provided any payment for repairs yet. Even though I've kept in consistent communication with them every step of the way. 

3. They never once mentioned insurance hasn't paid yet even though they approved us going ahead with the repairs. Even stated they would right a check the same day they were complete. Only now that the repairs are almost done do they realize they can't do that.

What is a reasonable time for insurance to pay out after they approve a claim if I feel like they are stalling? Does Colorado have any laws on this?"

219,Vehicle break-in.,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this short and sweet. The property that I live at has a garage door entry to the underground parking. 3 weeks ago, another Tennant ran into the garage door with their vehicle, completely wrecking it. My landlord has taken the damaged garage door off its tracks and it is simply laying, mangled inside the parking lot. For these 3 weeks, the parking stall for us all has been completely wide open, and unmitigated to people walking in and out regardless if they have a key or not. Fast-forward to last night. My vehicle was broken into and the bastatd tore apart my steering column and the door itself (my truck was locked). The criminal was able to just walk right and do this since the garage door is non-existant. Do I have any legal recourse at all? Is the Landlord liable in any way to pay the cost of my repair (the total was $1200 for the fix and 2 keys) in any way? Is it legal fir them to not fix a garage door for 3 weeks, exposing the vehicles inside to potential vandalism like me? I pay extra every month to have access to a secured parking spot, so the payment for this service is not being rendered as nothing is currently secured.Also, can they evict me if I sue them for the damages? Please let me know and have a good say."
220,Transgender discrimination in workplace,"Long story short. I’m a P.I.C. At a sub shop. Pic stands for person in charge the lowest form of manager.

I’ve been transitioning for prob almost 3 years now.
I changed my name about like a year into it and my general manager refused to call me by my new name since “it didn’t fit me and that’s not who he knows me as”

Until my coworkers basically made him call me by my real name.
Around like 2 years I got comfortable with my voice to where I started to use it at work. And immediately the general manager and my night time driver made fun of me non stop for it.

To where I stopped using it. Every so often I tried to use it and would get made fun of and stopped. Now I don’t feel safe or comfortable talking how I feel at work.

My nighttime driver also likes to make fun of the fact that I have a bf and stuff. To be honest. We play around a lot but he likes to be homophobic a lot. He will call me fa**ot and I’ll just call him one back.

Lately I’ve told him that I don’t want to keep it going like this. Since. Ya sometimes it’s kinda funny but mostly it just hurts. He went off saying if I don’t like it quit basically.

I talked to my general manager about it and he’s just like ya that sounds like him nothing we can do.

I can’t talk how I want and when I do I’m told things like “how hard do you have to squeeze your balls to sound like that”

Im. Just done at this point and plan on quitting.

My bf thinks that this situation has contributed to a lot of my depression and stuff. He thinks I should take legal action for discrimination but idk. Can I even make a cases. I have plenty of people willing to back me up. Also I can get evidence I don’t have any but if I talk like I want and record it I can get evidence.

Do I have a case?

221,Legality of hentai characters where age is unknown/impossible to tell?,"Hello all,

I was particularly curious as to the legality of hentai characters where there is a possibility, but it is unknown/impossible to tell if the characters are under the age of 18. Note that I am not talking about loli or shota hentai. I do not watch/read either of these. However, a huge portion of the characters in hentai are said to be in school (mostly meaning high school). For example, recently I saw one covering very adult looking women alongside an feminine (so especially difficult to tell) male. However, the characters (both the male and females) are implied to be in school. Mentions of whether they are in high school are not made, their ages are not given, and the characters even live alone (no parents present). This particular one has multiple parts both in animation and book, of which have been published by US companies as well.

I have seen a lot on the talk of legality of loli/shota, but few have asked about something like this. My main concern is could hentai, where it is maybe implied but it is actually difficult/impossible to tell the actual age of a character, illegal?

I should also note, that I am looking mostly at federal law, but I live in Florida for anyone who knows specifics on it here. I also marked as NSFW, for pretty obvious reasons."
222,Oklahoma - EEOC charge filed for terminating me because I have ADHD,"-I worked for a municipality and the city manager, knowing I had ADHD, kept making derogatory comments about how my adhd impacted my ability to listen 

-after having a conversation with the city manager + HR/city clerk/accountant (all in one), the comments stopped for awhile

-a few months later, I was called into a disciplinary meeting with the city manager + HR/clerk/accountant where I was asked about a change in my medication because my behavior was “off”

-following this meeting, I reported the comments to a city council member because I obviously couldn’t report it to HR

-at the next city council meeting (4 days later), the city manager was terminated 

-3 days after that, an interim city manager was hired

-5 days following the hiring of the interim city manager, the HR/clerk/accountant made a (false) claim that I had said I wanted to get her (the HR person) fired.

-3 days after the false claim, I was fired by the interim manager 

My lawyer says that the weak link in my case is proving that the interim city manager knew about my condition upon firing me.

How can I try to prove this?"
223,Is an anonymous audio recording admissible in court?,"I know someone who is due for pretrial may 8th for doing a horrible thing to a minor. I have an audio recording sent from him to me over social media in less eloquent terms he was unable to finish and wishes he would've recorded it and sold it for millions he also details who he was talking about in the recordings.  The guy is crazy and unhinged is this something I can take to the district attorneys without implicating myself to testify or is it meaningless without me saying ""without a doubt this was sent by him on his social media."" ?"
224,A neighbor is suing my parents for custody of their cat they've had for years,"(NOTE: Throwaway for obvious reasons; happy to verify my main account with the mods if that's against the rules. Also my apologies if this flair is incorrect; I chose the one that felt most accurate.)

So my parents adopted a friendly stray cat a few years ago who had been wandering our neighborhood for months. They had no collar, no chip, no shots or any evidence that they may have belonged to anyone else before, and attempt was made to find an owner pretty thoroughly before properly adopting them, both from my parents and others in the neighborhood (using resources like Nextdoor and Facebook). Since then they've been chipped and given appropriate shots and veterinary care on the regular.

Suddenly just a week ago, one of our neighbors saw a picture of the cat on social media and decided that it's actually their cat who has supposedly been missing pretty close to around the time we adopted ours. They've made multiple requests to my parents to pass over custody of their cat, which my parents of course denied. Today they received certified mail from this neighbor stating the intent to sue if custody of the cat isn't granted.

I'm convinced the neighbor is lying for a multitude of reasons. For example, they claim their lost cat has the same name as the one my parents adopted, but I was the one who suggested that name for my parents' cat, which sounds like it would be a very remarkable coincidence. Said neighbor also claims to have not seen any attempts to find an owner on Nextdoor because they didn't have a Nextdoor account at the time, but a perusal of their account shows they've been an active user on Nextdoor for YEARS before my parents adopted their cat. Said neighbor also suddenly put up a post on Nextdoor looking for their lost cat shortly before confronting my parents, which doesn't make sense if this was a cat they've been missing for years. And those are just the few big ones.

So like, what are my parents' options here and what does the law say? Should they call this neighbor's bluff? Countersue for emotional distress? Is there even any precedence on someone claiming someone else's cat as theirs YEARS after said cat was adopted ""on the books,"" with no ownership evidence of their own? I'm just really scared because we all love this kitty as family, and someone literally down the street from us coming out of nowhere to say we stole the cat from them has been distressing as hell."
225,Legality of Satire,"I want to publish a satirical diet book. I have a family member that falls victim to them, and recently spent $3k for a diet plan that was essentially ""eat fruits and vegetables with our expensive essential oils"". Yes, it's a pyramid scheme too haha.

Because I feel it is relevant, the ""satire diet"" would have ridiculous concepts like ""eat meals where all the food is the same color"" and science mumbo jumbo like ""photonic physicists have been studying the qualities and applications of chromatic therapy to balance the internal color spectrum and restore integrations between vital systems of the body""

It's fake. Super fake. But part of what makes it funny is treating and displaying the obviously fake information as if it was true, and I suppose if someone got hit really hard in the head and then skimmed through it, it might seem real. It has to look and feel like a real diet book, but is this legal? To portray false information in a manner that seems valid?

Would having a disclaimer that very clearly (in small font) states "" Please note the information contained in this book is entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. All claims, theories, and suggestions presented in this book are entirely made up and have no scientific basis. The author and publisher hereby disclaim any and all liability to any party for any direct, indirect, implied, punitive, special, incidental or other consequential damages arising directly or indirectly from any use of this book or its content. "" actually do anything?

Also, could I give the author a pen name with ""Dr."" in it? Is there any legal requirements to using that preffix? In the book, I might mention this fake author studying some kind of biology, but make it clear it isn't a medical dr.

I would not be trying to make money off this book. But could I sell it as a sort of ""comedy"". I feel like half the humor would be the fact that it actually exists and is possible to buy."
226,Copyright Infringement Retraction for Money?,"Hello, this is an oddly specific question that might be stupid. But I own exclusive rights to a viral video that hundreds of people are reposting on YouTube. I filed over 300 copyright claims this week to get the reposts removed from YouTube. However, I am now getting emails from dozens of people asking me to retract the copyright claim because it put a strike on their YouTube channel. They stole from me, so I have no intentions of retracting claims. However, I'm starting to think, completely because of the volume of requests, that I could charge money for a retraction? Larger YouTube accounts would be willing to pay money to not have a strike on their account. But would that even be legal? I know this is a stupid question but I'm just curious."
227,Court order to obtain Western Union transaction history?,"Basically, my father is having a disagreement with his brother, which has led to a dispute over the property in India that was left to both of them by their father. He has been pursuing legal stuff over there since that is where the property is, which includes the house his brother currently resides in. 

However, our family lives in the United States. We requested transaction history from Western Union which they sent to us, showing payments from the last 10 years that my father has sent to his brother, along with the dates & conversion amount. However, their website only allows us to request from the past 10 years, nothing over that. Would we able to get a court order (or anything else) that would allow us to request history further than that? Since a majority of the money that my father sent him was before 2013, it would be helpful to have to show them, especially since his brother denies the fact that my father has sent any money in the first place."
228,Neighbor keeps harassing us and now put these out.,"Hi!

I recently relocated to Rochester Minnesota in December for my wifes job. We bought our home and we love everything except our neighbors.

Ever since we have moved in they have constantly harassed us about their fence citing that we were ""piling up snow"" on it. Regardless of the fact that I told them that snow comes from the sky, not from our garage and reminded them about the middle school concept of snow drift/erosion. They have on one occasion even dumped all the snow that was between our fence and driveway onto my driveway and then left. Anytime we do something they have any semblance of an issue with they scream, cuss and as a result of their geriatric mouths with barely any teeth, spit on us in the process. I had planned to just keep ignoring it even though I know they keep coming onto our property to stare at their beloved fence that is approximately a foot away from our driveway/garage, but that's creepy.

Now here was the last straw for me. They posted these stupid signs at two points facing our driveway and at this point I feel like it's almost proof of them harassing me and definitely proof that they keep walking onto my property without permission, and I've flnally just reached my breaking point. Does anyone have any idea what I could do? I called our non emergency line and the cops basically said that the only thing we can do is get a restraining order or trespass them from our property. They also have decorated the front fence with one of those ""protected by the 2nd ammendment"" stickers that faces me every time I enter my driveway. I'm at a loss and was wondering if I could get any advice.

Lastly, yes the fence is behind their property lines, so I can't cite them for that.

Since I can't post an image, the sign is massive, red and reads 

""Absolutely no snow! No trespassing, no garbage, no yard debris, animals, mice or snakes. 

Any damage to property/fence is on you""

Thanks for your time."
229,"Can my employer install monitoring software on employee laptops and say it's ""anti-virus software""? California","My employer is requiring all employees to download a new program onto our computers. This program is a thinly veiled employee monitoring system that tracks our activity on our work computers. I know this is legal.

The problem is, my employer is pitching it as ""anti-virus software"". This is no disclosure in the official company email of what this software actually does and they're pretending it's for ""anti virus safety"". This is unprecedented at my company - never has my company required any type of tracking software and it's not mentioned in any policy documents that I'm aware of. My question is this:  Can my employer trick employees into installing monitoring software on their company laptops, without notifying employees of what it is they're installing?

I'm in California."
230,Rent deposit not returned (32 days and counting),"Fiancée and I rented a house in Washoe County, Nevada. Due to some unknown and unresolved health hazards at the property that we were not responsible for (broken sewer line filling crawlspace with raw sewage), we were released of our lease by the rental agency and moved out. It's been over a month since our lease was terminated and we moved out, and we've not received any portion of our deposit or partial month rent refund (lease terminated mid-month).

What are our best options at this point? By NV law we are to get our funds within 30 days and/or a itemized written account for funds deducted. Do we keep waiting and requesting our funds, or go to small claims? I think the rental agency is located in Lyon County, so would we file there or in Washoe County?

Thank you in advance."

233,Legal advice,"Hi there, 
My son was stopped at the stop sign in the right lane at a two-lane intersection and the school bus driver was in the left lane. As my son slightly inched forward to try to see the road, (as the school bus was blocking his vision of oncoming traffic), the school bus turned right, and ran over the front left of my son's car. It is a brand new 2023 civic that was just purchased at the end of March. The bumper was hanging off and the car had to be towed. My son got a witness' name, and phone number, but when the police arrived, they weren't able to reach her. The kids on the bus were also saying that this is the second time the driver has hit a car in just a few months, and confirmed that the bus driver made a right turn from the left lane. The police officer said that they need to watch the school bus' camera footage, and that they would get back to us on Monday. What steps should we proceed with now? How can I make sure that all of the expenses of the accident are covered?"
234,Help navigating legal fees.,"So essentially, I just got my number back for a year long procedure over a car accident and it was a multi car —car accident. The attorney I have, is charging me her 33.3 % fee for both policies separately as opposed to combining the numbers and taking 33.3 percent from the whole pie. This is almost a $20,000 difference that she will get and does not make sense, since, even though they got the first payment $25,000 almost 6 months before the last $100,000–they waited to disburse the money and make sense of deductions and what not.

Is this customary or are they trying to get over?"

They kept moving my engine around to a different shop. And saying they had to take a closer look at the engine.they told me that they had to get a new timing belt because mine was loose. Another week went by and more trouble had happened to my engine and what not. But thats all bs. At this point i knew they were just brushing me off and saying it will be done soon i kept checking on my car every day because I need my car to go to work. Finally I had enough of this crap and pulled my car out because all I wanted was a simple oil change and these people decided to take everything out of my engine bay including my filter my battery etc. I'm left with an empty shell of a car. I'm not satisfied whats so ever. My car is a 2003 toyota carmy there is no reason why it should take no more than 2 weeks to get the job done.

237,Fined for Service Dog on beach,"
Me and three of my friends went to a beach in Georgia, and one of my friends has a service dog for medical reasons. 

When we entered the beach, a sign said “no dogs, no smoking” etc, but we assumed since the dog is a medical service dog we would be fine. 

The dog had his vest on and was leashed until we set up our stuff, then all he had was a regular collar and an e-collar, which would vibrate and beep to contain/command him which was always held by someone, so he wasn’t unsupervised or not under control. He didn’t disturb anyone, we threw a frisbee for him a couple times, otherwise he just sat on our towels. Some people came up to him actually, but he minded his business.

Eventually one of the beach patrol guys came up to us, and told us someone called him about a “dog causing disturbance” and when we told him he was a medical service dog, he said he still had to ticket us for “dog at large” because he wasn’t leashed. He filled out a ticket, and got the address wrong, if that information helps. 

We wanted to know if we could/should fight it, since the dog didn’t disturb anyone, we have photo evidence of him wearing his e collar before the ticket, and he was doing his job. Can we?"
238,Child custody with mental disability (adhd) (California),"I could really use some legal advice, as me and my husband are arguing a bit back and fourth about this. My husband suffers from really bad Adhd - medication don't help - and anxiety, this is obviously a combo which makes it really hard for him to find work. Because of that I have been suggesting that he may plead his case and hopefully get disabled benefits, which would make his life a lot easier, however.. He believes that if he gets disabled benefits and gets accepted as unable to work, that he will lose all ability to have custody and hopefully full custody of his son some day. He is a very loving and attentive father, and he has never once made me doubt his abilities to be a father. Beside that he is marrying me in the start of May, and I got a stable job and somewhat high end sales degree, which I personally also believe counts towards custody, as it shows we are a stable household with a solid income and will be able to provide for the kid. Is there anyone who would be able to answer whether it really will matter in a custody case or not, as I personally think the judgment should be on the person's ability to take care of their kids, and not whether they are unable to work, but that is just my personal opinion ofcause, that doesn't mean the system is put together that way"
239,My sister’s dentist caused her to need a root canal,Is this grounds to sue? My sister has been dealing with horrible tooth sensitivity for months after several fillings. She kept going back to her dentist and they tried fixing it with more fillings but she still gets the same pain. She went to a children’s dentist today (she’s 18) and they told her she will need a root canal because the filling the previous dentist made was too deep. Insurance won’t cover the procedure either. Can we sue the last dentist for this? In GA btw
240,Is this retaliation?,My SIL is found out she is pregnant recently. Her doctor put her on light duty because she has had multiple miscarriages and is considered high risk. She brought the papers her doctor gave her to her managers and told her she was going to file a reasonable accommodation through Sedgwick. Her managers told her that if that happens they didn’t have a job for her. Is this considered retaliation and discrimination? This job did something similar to me when I was pregnant too. We live in Mississippi
241,Friend needs to sell their house.,"Hello! This is happening in Arkansas. I have a friend whose mother died a few years ago, leaving themselves and their two siblings with the house she had owned outright. She was a hoarder and the house is in terrible condition, and my friend would not be able to afford to renovate it or live there as it is now. My friend is the only one of their siblings able to do anything with the house as their younger sibling is only 18 and their older sibling is an addict who they have not been able to make contact with in the years since their mom died. I really think selling their house is their best bet, but because they don't know how to deal with their situation, they haven't made any progress on selling it. My friend very briefly spoke to a real estate agent for advice right after their mother's death, but got discouraged when they were unable to find their older sibling.

My question is, how can they begin the process of selling this house without their oldest sibling around? Can they just start the process and hope he shows up? He has no permanent address or phone number, he doesn't work or have any social media presence, and the local police have not been able to help us in finding him either. The house is in their deceased mother's name, and as it was explained to me all three siblings would have to agree to the sale."
242,I need legal advice about harassment and stalking… I’m in California and the other person is in another state.,"My ex boyfriend has been harassing my husband. I don’t know the exact address or where my ex currently resides, I just know he’s in one of two states in mind. We have chosen not to talk to him. He’s made multiple social media accounts to try to friend my husband, emailed his work email, sent threatening letters to our house, and somehow got ahold of my husbands phone number and began texting him. He just sends old pictures of me and him to my husband and says dirty things and wants to talk to my husband and belittle him pretty much. He keeps implying that he wants to meet up with him and talk to him. We chose to block him and ignore all of his attempts to contact. The only thing we did was we sent a cease and desist letter via email since we don’t know where he physically resides. He still contacted us after the C&D letter. Any advice would be appreciated. My ex doesn’t have money so we don’t want to sue him (there’s nothing to gain) and we don’t really wanna see him get locked up, we just want the behavior to stop. He already has a sad life and we just want the best for him and to leave us alone. He’s just harassing my husband for no reason. It’s uncomfortable and annoying. I don’t know how he got ahold of my husbands phone number or work email and I know he’s a hacker. I’m not sure if he’ll ever have the audacity to show up at our front door. How can we protect ourselves? What can we do? We shouldn’t have to live the rest of our lives in fear. We had to completely wipe our names off Google and social media. I can’t shake off the thought of wanting to move but we don’t have the money to do that at the moment. I’m pretty much untraceable and he has not made attempts to contact me personally. I know he still has feelings for me obviously. I don’t want to live this way forever. I’m not sure what he’s capable of doing because I never saw this side of him before, but the way he’s acting and talking to my husband is concerning."
243,Can employer ask for age during interview and refuse job if you don’t tell them?,"An employer called for an interview and after asking about job experience they asked ""how old are you"".

244,Help with suspended license,"Everyone, I am totally defeated at this point and I'm hoping someone, anyone can help. 

I live in new Jersey, Bergen county specifically.  Currently, my license is suspended and has been expired since 2019. I know, I know I should've gotten this taken care of when it happened all those years ago. 

Anyway, anytime I get pulled over the officer says My license is suspended and expired and I explain the situation: I have paid all the courts I owed money to, I don't have 12 or more points on my license, and I owe no money to any MVCs at all. When I ask the cop who pulls me over what courthouse I owe money to that's causing the suspension, they say nothing shows up. 

Next, I went on the DMVs website and it says I owe no restitution. So that's also a dead end. Finally, I got in contact with a lawyer who says there might be a debt owed that has been sent to a debt collector. I checked my credit, and nothing shows up. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who I owe money to, or if I owe money at all. I try to set up an appointment (because in NJ you need to) at the MVC, but the website said I can't because my license is expired. 

Again, this is 1000000000000% my own fuck up. I just need someone, literally anyone to tell me what I'm missing and how to fix this. I'm tired of bringing my fucking passport to bars when I need to show identification, I'm tired of not having a car in my name, and I'm tired of just not having the same freedom as any other New jersian. Please, any help would be greatly appreciated."
245,Am I able to sue?,"I was in a falsified dv case from the state and only thing I did was contempt of court(was set up av's mother) and was given a plea only on that with 12 months bench probation and they dismissed the falsified charges, am I able to sue the state for emotional distress and false imprisonment for the original charges?"
246,Can my ex hide all our assets under an LLP so I don’t get half in our divorce?,"I am going through a divorce with my ex, we have two children, a mortgage, two car loans, and a good amount of stuff. As of this writing I have filled divorce but we’re still officially married. We’re in Texas.


Last fall, while we were married, he formed three companies: a LLP which owns a for-profit LLC which owns a non-profit LLC. According to the business structure, he and I each have a 1% stake in the LLP, and each of the LLCs own 49% stake in the LLP. My ex owns 100% of the for-profit LLC, which owns 100% of the non-profit LLC. There was no official legal counsel consulted for the formation of these companies; he got a Partnership Agreement template for the LLC from a LegalZoom equivalent. I do have a copy of that I can consult if questions arise.


He basically is trying to turn our “estate” into a business. He says the LLP owns our house and all our assets and liabilities. *He* and *I* don’t actually own anything, it’s all considered a depreciable asset of the LLP. According to his 2022 Annual Report, each of the 3 companies are considered a “Real Estate Investment Trust” and none of them have any tax due. He hasn’t done any business with the for-profit or non-profit LLCs, no clients, $0 in the business bank accounts.


If you check the public records for our home, only his and my names are on the deed of our house, not any of the companies.


He did a complete estate asset valuation table that included almost every item in our home that we own. I’ll mention, last spring we sold our first house and got a pretty hefty cash profit, about $80k of which went into a down payment and upgrades on our current house. The remaining $80k he pretty much unilaterally spent on STUFF. I wanted to invest, I tried to save, but he spent it, and more, putting us further in credit card debt. Our couples therapist heavily suspected Narcissistic Personality Disorder, that coupled with lots of other stuff led to me filing for divorce.


It was my understanding that in the divorce, I am entitled to half our community property, or realistically half the fair market value of our community property. Especially since he spent all our cash, we can’t afford our mortgage, car payments, and preschool tuition without his mom’s help, so all we really have is *stuff*.


I wrote up a proposal because we’re trying to settle out of court. I do have legal representation (I’m going to confer with him about this of course, but I want to be armed with all the info I can), but my ex is representing himself. We agree on custody entirely (50/50), and he didn’t seem to have an issue with the standard child support calculator. We mutually want a good-faith, inexpensive, efficient, out-of-court settlement.


Upon reading my proposal, he said I have NO claim to half the value of our assets because they’re owned by the LLP. I don’t think he has an issue physically giving me some stuff, but he doesn’t think he owes me half the fair market value of the community property he’s keeping. Is that legit? Everything I’ve read about hiding assets from divorce in LLCs is referencing LLCs formed PRIOR to marriage, where the assets wouldn’t be community property. He says I’m entitled to half the equity of our LLP, which is all our assets minus all our liabilities, which conveniently equals zero according to his valuations. 


I’m well over my head here, and trying not to be the victim of his mental/emotional/financial abuse anymore. If anyone has read this far and has input, I am so grateful."
247,Potential Job Offer Scam? (Personal Assistant),"Hey guys! I’m pretty worried about this situation so if you have the time to read & respond, I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you :)

For context, I (23 F) recently applied to a ton of jobs, including this remote personal assistant job for a guy who owns a hydraulics business. Because I was applying to so many jobs, I didn’t really check out this particular company’s website or even give them a Google Search (this was really dumb lol). 

A few days later, I received an email from the employer saying that I was chosen for an interview. However, the guy said he was too busy dealing with health issues to have a phone call interview, so he asked me questions via email. Upon finally searching for his company online, I wasn’t able to find an official website offering more information. I did, however, find one or two websites leading to an address & a phone number for the business, but that’s about it. After submitting my answers to the interview questions, I was offered the job. 

The employer said we would have the chance to talk (via phone or Zoom) next week regarding more details about the position. He also had me fill out a short letter with my personal information, including my name, address, phone number, and email. I filled out the letter and sent it back to him, along with some questions of my own regarding the job. 

My questions consisted of, “when do we start?” and “what’s the tentative work schedule?”. I also raised my concern about the lack of an official company website and asked for more information about the business itself. From the get-go, I had a gut feeling that this opportunity might be too good to be true, but a friend of mine reassured me by mentioning that his father owns a business and doesn’t have a website because all of his clients come from word of mouth. That, in itself, made me feel better and trust that this job opportunity could be real.

After I sent that email, he responded back without really answering any of my questions…Rather, he said that my first task was to deposit one of his business checks and donate the money to some foster homes to help children fight COVID-19. That check would also include my first week’s pay. At the end of the email, he wanted me to confirm that I had the ability to deposit a check. 

After I read that, it was the final red flag that lead me to searching up personal assistant scams online. I found out that it’s a legitimate thing and now I’m worried that something bad may happen because I was dumb enough to give him my personal information. My bank info and social security number were NOT given to him, so that makes me feel a bit safer, but I just don’t know.

Overall, my question is:

Did I just dodge a bullet? Is this actually a scam? Can my personal info be stolen and lead to identity theft? Or am I overthinking everything?

Thank you for your time."
248,USA/FL My friend’s dad left my friend a % of his house and small business. My friend no longer lives in the house (physical abuse) and the business was sold without his consent and he did not receive any money,"These are all the details I have for now as it’s very hard for him to talk about. He was essentially bullied out of the house (years ago) by a power trio of his blood brother and friends physically abusing him, and legally he held a portion of his father’s business. -EDIT: The business was not sold, instead he owns roughly 25% but is not receiving any money from the ownership of the business.

249,Can I sue a hospital for a botched hernia surgery in 2016?,"In 2016 I had a double strangulated hernia and had emergency surgery. The surgeon cut me open from right underneath my breasts to the very bottom of my torso. Obviously recovery was rough. Almost immediately after recovering, the hernia was back. They did not use any mesh and said they had just stitched it up. I am still dealing with it, basically look 600 months pregnant, and I’m so ashamed of it I don’t leave the house often. I know it’s been over six years since the surgery and I should have done something about it way back then, but I didn’t.

251,Dog bite situation unlike others?,"Might be long but I’ll try to make it short

So I was bit by a dog in June of 2021 while I was working for a pesticide company by a customers dog. I didn’t really care to sue as long as the dog was caught up on shots which it was. 

The problem I had/have was the company said they would pay for all the medical bills and I filled out a form at the urgent care for that to be done.

Eventually I get a bill for $150ish from the urgent care, I tell my boss he says “bring it in we’ll send it to HR it’ll be taken care of”

Well this happened 3 more times and the last time I thought everything had been fine but today I get a letter from a debt collector for over $1000 from the urgent care. 

I contacted HR and they haven’t gotten back to me about it so I called the labor board of my state and filled out some forms.

I’m wondering if it would be something to let an attorney handle? I don’t really want anything other than the bill to be paid so it doesn’t affect my credit.

Sometimes the posts get pretty worn and they repair them which seems to be the case here, thing is mines just missing and not there. I noticed it was missing yesterday but I’m not sure how long it’s been gone. I called them at 11:30 today and explained the situation and they said they will look into it after lunch, I come home from work and it’s still not there, no call back and there’s no way to contact them until Monday. I not only had important mail inside, but other things like contacts I ordered. I’m almost positive whatever happen to it was from the repair done to the post, maybe they forgot to put it back? Maybe they lost it? I’m not really sure but that seems pretty negligent on there part.

Honestly I’m pretty easy going and not the type to start any kind of conflict, I’ve always been a good tenant and never had any problems before. But there’s new management and they just hit me with a 50$ fine for something totally unreasonable (that’s another story). Basically I want to tell them to kick rocks on the fine until I know what happen to my mailbox and I’m reimbursed for the things I ordered. I’ve taken pictures of the missing mailbox, I even recorded the call with management. Any help on how to continue this would be greatly appreciated"
253,Finding a lawyer,How do I go about finding a lawyer for my needs? I have a civil case with an ex of mine for partition of sale but I keep getting bounced around from office to office and it’s really frustrating
254,Possible to execute a short sale and collect the insurance claim?,"I own a residential property in New York City that sustained significant water damage ($200k) that will be covered by my homeowners insurance. My mortgage balance is $500k and the property is worth $450k in it's current condition and have short sale buyers beating down my door prepared to pay cash. How can I execute a short sale (assuming Wells Fargo approves) and still collect my insurance claim? For those who haven't dealt with large insurance claims before, the money is not paid to the homeowner but rather the lender. The lender then releases 50% of the insurance settlement to the homeowner to begin work then the remaining 50% once the work is complete OR the home has been sold. My thinking is why wouldn't I collect the initial 50%, negotiate and execute the short sale, then provide proof the home was sold thus having the remaining 50% released to me? It seems like a lot of work but there is 100s of thousands of dollars at stake."
255,I need your help with my registered agent,"I registered my company in the state of Wyoming 2 days ago, and I also hired an agent because I don't have anyone in the state of Wyoming. Here's the problem, I'm a non US citizen so due to that, the agent asked me to provide him with a document that verifies my identity as well as my address.  

I live in a country where my ID, Passport, and driving licenses has most of my information but it does not have my actual address. I don't own or rent a house, I don't own a car, so I don't have a bill to provide.  What can I do???"
256,Landlord hasn’t found a permanent fix to our HVAC system,"Hi all. I’m in NYC. Upon moving into a new place late Dec, my roommate made me aware that the HVAC system in the whole building was broken, so until they fixed it, we’d be using the space heaters the landlord provided for us. 

it was fine for a few weeks. then someone came and fixed the HVAC system in the building, only my apartment remained without heat. My roommate said this has happened before, so she reached out and eventually they came to look at it. 

I was actually home for a good portion of January, but my roommate says it was broken that whole time. They came back the beginning of Feb to fix it, and it remained fixed for only about two weeks. On February 22nd I reached out to have someone come fix it again. 

That is last time I can remember the HVAC was half working. Since Feb, it’s been back and forth with the landlord trying to have someone come fix it. I’ve been here since late December, and the HVAC has worked for only a total of about 3-4 weeks of that time. 

After begging, someone finally showed up and fixed the damn thing today. So i made it through winter without it working. 

my question is, Am I really forced to pay for the heating and cooling costs in my rent if it was broken this entire time? am i SOL? Or is it at least worth the shot to try to get some compensation for this?"
257,I got paid recently and noticed my check was about 1/3 of what I should have gotten.,"I work at a restaurant as a server so I make 2.13 an hour plus tips. I worked 62 hours (about 13 shifts in a 2 week pay period) and my check before taxes was only $1100. $430 was from tip share (I work as a bartender a few shifts a week so I get tip share from severs). That part made sense. The part that doesn’t make sense is the tips on my check. The check said I made $550 in tips in two weeks. I make that in 2 days. Every shift I make at least $100, with some shifts being $250-$350. 

My last check was suspiciously low but I chalked it up to me missing a few shifts plus training shifts at the bar. But now I think my last check was way under too. I told my GM and my other manager and they even said that doesn’t add up. They said they contacted corporate yesterday and they are looking over my checkouts with all my tips for the last month. I worked there 4 years and I never had this happen until I started training as a bartender a few weeks ago. My guess is that it was an honest mistake because of how I put in my tips. I’m supposed to be clocked in under “bartender” but corporate has not given me the button to clock in as such. So whenever I’ve been bartending, I clock in under “greeter” because I would get tipshare under this button as well. The way tipshare is distributed works like this: for each week they collect all tipshare from servers and to-go tips from greeters and split it up evenly amongst all the greeters and bartenders. So if you worked more hours that week, you got a bigger share. So since I’ve been putting my tips under my greeter number, they might have distributed my tips to everyone.

I guess my question is, is there a certain time frame they need to pay the rest of what I’m owed (if it does turn out they underpaid me)? My rent is tomorrow (Ik, it’s in the middle of the month) and $900 in downtown Dallas is not enough to get by. 

My other question I have is do I need to report this? Or should I wait for their response? What if they claim I was not underpaid? What should I do then?

Final question, would they need to compensate me more if it takes them a long time to send the rest of my paycheck to me?"
258,TX - Update on gamestop giving my PS5 to a thief.,"I called the corporate line like most of you suggested. Thanks for that. Also F you for that. Holy hell that line was the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. Including comcast. 

Anyways. After being transferred from India to China to Taiwan and then to Malaysia. Or just 3 different departments whom had no clue what the hell was going on. Seriously… Warm transfers anyone? I finally got on the phone with someone who mattered. I had to send the video from my phone to them, but they finally agreed that the store screwed up. They gave me a replacement right away.  They asked if the same store was a good place to pick up the unit, I said yes and they gave me some instructions for the supervisor there. 

Get to the store and new employees are there. Manager I talked with had been hired yesterday so apparently this was bad enough for the previous people to be gone. Either that or they just hired a new manager. He had to make 3 phone calls to get the transaction processed. Its like they hired a kid off the street and didn’t train them. Either way doesn’t matter to me. Ill never be back to gamestop ever.  

I get the unit home and noticed it was the disk version. At that point I no longer cared that it was an upgrade. I was done and never wanted to go through this process again. I just spent the day transferring his ps4 games to his ps5. 

Side note. The guy who stole the ps5 got caught. The manager realized the situation halfway through and told me they caught the guy. Said he did it to several gamestops and got caught in the act at one of them."
259,Breaking my lease because my apartment is making me ill,"Okay I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but if anyone could help me get some guidance on this? I live in an apartment in NYC, and one of my roommates kinda went off his rocker. He's been chain smoking cigars and weed in the living room and blaring loud music, and gets super aggressive when anyone (particularly women) tell him to stop or at least do all that in his room. It got so bad that my last roommate moved out because of it, complaining to the landlord after she did so. I have a horrible chronic nausea problem and basically haven't been able to live or sleep in my own apartment for months. I emailed my landlord like two weeks ago with evidence, first asking if I could see the smoking policy which they were required by law to have (they couldn't provide me with one), then emailing them about the situation, (they told me they'd reach out after the weekend) then emailing them again when no one got back to me. I'm really just wanting to break my lease because I can't afford this much money for a glorified storage unit at this point. My question is, what could I be liable for if I did this? I know most places require that you find a replacement, but I couldn't even show the place to a prospective tenant to replace the roommate that moved, because he had trashed it and was shitting with the bathroom door open when I came in, then got aggressive when I asked him to close it. I'm already a month behind on rent and am trying to scrape by to pay it off, and it feels ridiculous to be doing all of this for a place I can't even live in. I also know for a fact that if they send the roommate a written notice to stop, he won't even read it much less follow it. How the fuck do I get out of this place?"
260,"Legal advice about medical practices, Georgia, USA","I had a visit with my primary care doctor yesterday, morning. It was the usual follow up talking about my current condition and get medications refilled. During the visit the doctor asked me about my right arm surgery. The way the conversation went was like him telling me to not take the medication for the surgery. I tried telling the surgery was part of the solution, but I had neuropathy since this injury in high school. But every time I tried telling the doctor about the issue I had previously, he stops me and I think he said something like be careful not to take the med for the wrong reason. Then we finished the conversation with him telling me, he'll see me in a few months and get my blood and urine sample. 

&#x200B;

So I left and went home,  I looked at my medication refill and there was only that was being refilled, but not the other. I called the doctor's office, the nurse tells me it was sent and pending in kroger's system. So I said ok please give me a call when it does get refilled (at this point I was out of the medication for over a week). 

When they called me back, the nurse tells me the doctor had concerns about the potential of the medication and he stopped it. I was like what do you mean? shouldn't you at least discuss a treatment plan with me, before you do that? She was like oh, do you still need the medication? I said yes, I do I have been out of medication for over a week and my nerve has been flaring up and my hand is going numb. So she was like I will give the doctor your message and get back to you. 

So I waited and as I waited, I thought there might've been a miscommunication with the doctor, so I wrote him a message and submitted a refill request through their patient portal. Then we played a game of phone tag. The next time they called back, they changed their story and said the doctor wants me to see a neurologist, I was like ok that's fine. Even though I don't have insurance moment, but that's not a problem. You can't just cut off my medication without consulting me and come up with a treatment plan. I was never told my medication is gone during the visit, that is extremely unprofessional and it feels like this ethics violation. 

Obviously the nurse couldn't answer back on those, then the conversation becomes we can give you referrals and give you finance assistance application for xxxx hospital. I was like ok that's fine I'll take it, but what about in the meanwhile? 

&#x200B;

I asked her if she knew how the approval of thhe apllication was? She goes no I don't it depends on the case. So I was like ok, you don't know and you cut off my medication without consulting me or give me adequate notice. That is not right, you need to give me medication for the meantime at least. So she goes well ok I'll call the pharmacy and try to give you 2 weeks. I'm like is that the average time for finance assistance approval? Again, she doesn't know. So I said you need to give at least a month. So she and I went back and forth, it ended with her telling me she will call pharmacy to give a month. 

After that she called again, to tell me I had a refill left on my medication so she called that in. I told her no I don't I just checked my medication. She insisted there was and that I can pick it up today. She wasn't happy on and just fudge the call, it was cut in and out at that point. 

So I waited til tomorrow checked my medication again, there was a refill request from the pharmacy to them. So I called them back and told them, there is no refill left. Then the nurse was irritated and finally called the pharmcy to give me a one month refill. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: the doctor cut off my medication without consulting me, the nurses tried to cover for the doctor by making up excuse and changing their story about: doctor wanting me to prove my condition. 

&#x200B;

TLDR2: I've seen this doctor for the last 4 years whether I had insurance or not. I've always talked about condition and the history of it. I've never had any altercation with this doctor. 

&#x200B;

So I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse for actions like this? I've met a lot of terrible doctors, since I moved to Georgia. Not only are they unprofessional, they just don't have any ethics at all. It's like patients are just burgers. This feels very unprofessional and gotta violate some kind of doctor's ethics."
261,My wife’s teeth saga,"First time poster, long time creeper of the sub. This is a long story but I will keep it as short as I can.  

My (35M) beautiful wife (35F) has had a lot of dental issues since she was a small child. In 2016 she had to go see a dentist because of immense pain. That dentist determined she needed 9 root canals and other major work done. This dentist then also presented the option of the “All on 4” procedure but we needed to be referred to an oral surgeon for this. In the visit with the oral surgeon we leaded that this meant pulling all of her teeth (instead of all the root canals etc.) and then he would be doing implants into the jaw bones. She needed the top and bottom of her mouth done so 8 total implants. We were quoted $40k for the procedure and not something dental insurance would cover. We leave the consultation disheartened and not knowing what we would need to do. 

My wife then receives a call from the initial dentist and is asked to be in a commercial that the dentist and oral surgeon were going to partner and both use and they would do the procedure for $10k. This also supposedly included lifetime aftercare and we decide to proceed with the procedure.

This began in 2016 and was not completed until 2017. She had the initial implant procedure done by the oral surgeon which was a fairly big ordeal and after waiting for the swelling to go down the dentist is then to begin to make the denture that is to be attached to the implants. This is also a lengthy process with many appointments and breaks and other mishaps with the teeth/denture. She finally gets the final permanent teeth in and we think everything is good to go. The dentist discharges her and says to call if there is ever a problem. There were some breaks and things and at one point the top denture broke and her front 3 teeth were out she was embarrassed as it happened at a family weekend event and she wound up using a denture repair kit to get them reattached herself. Everything was mostly fine for some years. 

We are now caught up to present day and the issue I would love some advice on. She woke up one morning 3 weeks ago and the bottom denture had totally become detached from the implant posts. We have had 2 dentist tell us there is no way this should’ve happened. We go back to the office of the dentist as this is what she has been told to do but that specific dentist is no longer employed there and is uncontactable according to them. After 2 appointments we learn that nobody working there is familiar with the procedure or even knows where the toolkit to take the screws out of the dentures or anything we basically leave with them telling us they will try to figure something out but we had better look for someone else to help her. We have since found another office that has been wonderful. The parts were ordered today to put her bottom denture back on and after this long she is finally back on the way to being able to eat solid food so that is good. We’ve also learned the first dentist caused several issues such as the shape of the denture is not correct which has led to her having a small gap that can collect food and has accelerated some bone loss around the implants and she needs to have a new set made which will cost $26k. The agreement was that the first dentist would be providing these services for life but they are now unable to causing us to need to find a way to pay the 26k as there really isn’t any other option. Does this sound like we should have any personal injury legal recourse?"
262,Advice,"I had got into a car accident over two years ago, where there was a court date I attended to and pled guilty. The plaintiff, that I had hit never showed up to the court date. My insurance paid me out on my end and the case was dismissed. Now, over two years later, I am being sued for personal injury’s and damages. How should I go about this situation?"
263,House Issue," 

I live with my dad and family in a shared ownership house under him, his brother and sister. The house was bought by my grandfather. My dad was given power of attorney by his parents and unfortunately he lost the documents. We called the law firm which was merged a while back and they have no records of it anymore. Document was in early 80’s. Is there any way to request a document preferably original copy? If yes, where do we go? Already asked the law firm and there’s been no help. Also, the guy from their law company who wrote the power of attorney sadly passed away years back and there is no electronic copy of the document. 

Main issue is my dad’s sister (aunt) wants her share but we can’t afford to give her the sum as it’s too much and we have no other house to stay other than this and for this reason my dad (retired) doesn’t want to sell it. She already has a big house and lives with her family. If I had enough money I would have given her the share. I believe she is thinking of taking us to court. What are the options in court? What can she do since power of attorney belongs to my father. What would happen to power of attorney once my dad’s gone? Is there a way to transfer power of attorney to me and will it be valid after he’s gone?

In summary I’m looking at legal actions we can save the house from selling? Will the power of attorney save us from court? As an evidence, do we need power of attorney document? If possible please advise other options for this crisis? What would be the best scenario and what can worse happen in this situation? Again, we are not in a position at the moment to give her house share in money.

Thanks"
264,Mold issue,"Mold issue

I rent an apt in Central CA (SC County) and I noticed a square of discoloration in December - when an agent from my realtor showed up to fix the fire alarm, we showed him the square and he just told us to clean it and move along. We had a very rainy DJF and the problem became much more prevalent despite our attempts to clean. We sent a formal notice in late February to ask them to fix the issue but their response was just “clean it with a solution and keep the area dry”. It has been 6 weeks since the initial notice and now that we threatened legal action they decided to send an inspector for the mold to determine which kind. What would we as tenants be entitled to and/or would we be able to break lease due to “implied warrant of habitability” or can they just come and fix and nothing more? Thank you.


I can’t post images but the main size of the mold is about a square foot above a bedroom door and maybe 3 sq feet behind the closet doors"
265,Seeking legal info on divorce and house.," Info- husband and i met in 2016, in 2017 we house shopped, He bought the house, i signed nothing, we have a 3 year old and have been married since 2018. We live in Arizona. 

 I may be filing for divorce, what legal grounds do i have on the house?  Am i entitled to half?  He has always refused to let me contribute to bills. He pays the house, and household bills.  I pay our childcare and our cell phones.  I pay for 95% of our kids needs. I have payed for a new shower remodel (7k) and new built ins framing the fireplace for 5k.  He payed for the new flooring upstairs.  

So i have somewhat contributed to our home exspenses but not in a traditional split of bills. 

Income wise, i make roughly 55k annually, he makes around 50k and gets roughly 30k in disability annually.  

He uses the house in fights and tells me to get the fuck out of his house. Its very frustrating,  and he threatens to throw me out. He is also suicidal and severly depressed and has severe PTSD. 
I am at my wits end because he is emotionally abussive, and quite scary at times."
266,"Moving out of a rental property before the end of the lease Chicago, IL","Hi all, I was hoping to ask for some advice about renting in Chicago, IL if anyone knows some more about these rules. 

My 2 roommates have lived in this apartment since August 2021 and I moved in August 2022- when we signed a joint lease contract with all of our names on it. However due to a lot of issues with the roommates, including them going through my things when I am not home, I am trying to move out as quickly as I can and just signed a new lease to start May 1.  This is 3 months before the end of my current lease at the end of July. I was advised to look over the Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance to see about the security deposit/ rent for the 3 months after I vacate the unit and turn in my keys. This is where I have my question, does the re-rental section apply to me? This part: “the landlord shall make a good faith effort to re-rent the tenant's dwelling unit at a fair rental, which shall be the rent charged for comparable dwelling units in the premises or in the same neighborhood.” 

I know some people who have been able to avoid paying the additional rent for the months they didn’t live in the unit, but they didn’t have roommates. My plan was just to pay the 3 months rent up front, ask the landlord to do a walkthrough of my room/ common areas, and request my portion of the security deposit be paid to me directly. However, if I am able to avoid paying 2 rents for May- July that would be ideal, but I don’t know if that still works with all of us on the same lease.

Any advice you may have would be appreciated, Thanks in advance!"

I told him he didn't live here anymore but of course they still searched because the address was on the warrant.

Today I got a call saying they're replacing the carpet in the apartment and now don't want to let me have a pet for ""at least the first year"" due to new carpet. If I want to get a pet the first year, I'll have to ask them to not replace the carpet stained from the previous tenant. What do I do?"
269,"Husband's W4 was changed January 2022, not by him.","It was discovered while filing our taxes that my husband didn't have enough federal withholdings taken out of his check during 2022.  We both have our W4s as married filing jointly, but do not include our kids. I know we're giving the government a loan, but it's better than paying and we've always had a refund.  We started digging into what happened because it's a pretty substantial tax bill we owe now, and no one can find the supporting documentation of the W4 or why his changed. His company changed to a payroll company around the time that the update occurred and they've been of no help.
Steps we've taken so far:
1) Requested a copy of the W4 from the payroll company, but they said they couldn't supply it.  Said they couldn't give it, because he was terminated (he wasn't, his company just switched payroll companies again).
2) Requested it from HR at the home office and no one can find it there. 
3) Requested an audit trail from the payroll company and they could only provide the date it was changed and that the change came from my husband's company.
4) Contacted the former HR employee that would have handled any of those details at that time before they left, and they gave a file location where those changes were documented.  Reached back out to HR at the company now and no one has ""access"" to the files because they're digital and setup before any of them started.

Question is, do we have any recourse for this?  We don't remember making the change or authorizing it, and the lack of his company being able to supply the W4 is raising red flags for us.  We've since corrected his W4 and will be monitoring his paychecks going forward for the Federal withheld, but is there anything we can do to get back some of the thousands that should have been withheld?  I know the tax has to be paid, and not disputing that, I just feel like his company should have some skin in the game since this occurred because of an apparent error on their side.  This all happened in VA USA."

272,My apartment complex has given me a final statement for all move out fees my security deposit doesn’t cover. Some of them don’t make sense. (TX),"Hello, all. First time poster on this subreddit. Please let me know if you need any more information.

So, first part. We have a few $10 for dirty things. So, the ceiling fan in one of the rooms, the oven, the toilet in of the bathrooms, and the dishwasher. Would that not qualify as normal wear and tear that we aren’t responsible for? We did clean all these things except the ceiling fan so I guess we just didn’t clean to their satisfaction? 

Next, they’re replacing the living room blinds ($148) even though they were fully functional with all blinds in tact. I do not have a photo proving that however.

Next, they’re replacing the kitchen vinyl ($355). They did not include a reason why. I’m also not sure if that’s the countertops or the flooring. They did not clarify, but both were clean so I’m not sure why they’d need replacing.

Next, they’re replacing the carpet ($1,345). This one is the only one I can understand, but also the one I’m most worried about as I do not have $1,345. There was a green stain (darn McDonalds Shamrock shake) about 6x6 inches in the main bedroom and carpet all throughout the apartment. It just says they’re charging for carpet replacement, it does not clarify if that’s for the entire apartment. There was mold all throughout the second bedroom because our upstairs neighbors A/C system leaked. We reported it to management, but they never fixed it. So most likely there was mold damage to the carpet in that bedroom.

They are also charging for resurfacing of the bathtub ($225), but that’s because there is hair dye stains all over it so I’m not here to dispute that charge. 

I just need help going through these charges, because $2113 is a ton of money and I want to make sure they’re all legitimate. Let me know if you need more information and please help."

274,Damaged Furniture + credit card dispute dismissed on forgery,"Need some advice on dealing with furniture company and credit card company. 

Can I pursue this in court considering 

(1) they committed signature forgery, 

(2) didn’t provide all the services I paid for (white glove delivery) and quality of product I paid for 

(3) credit card company dismissed a dispute based on falsified documents. 

Background (1-3) Problem (4-5)

1. Delivery window: 
Delivery was split into two shipments. estimated delivery date was not confirmed for weeks until delivery for each shipment was suddenly notified the day before. 

2. Delivery Team:
White glove delivery option was purchased. Delivery team was hostile (to the point of intimidation),and refused to wear shoe covers when setting up furniture in bedroom. Furniture assembly was not complete for all items. Delivery team did not even seem to care. 

3. Furniture condition:
Furniture was damaged either from warehouse and/or during set up (as delivery team tended to be quite careless) 

4. Service/Support:
Shocked at every step, filed a claim with 1StopBedrooms and my representative did not seem to care nor was surprised. They offered $150 credit for a $4,000 order. I refused. They make refund process difficult and a financial loss (horrible customer policies). You have to pay for return shipping by the weight for example. Even more difficult if you purchased white glove service as the team takes back the furniture packaging. 1StopBedrooms still has not provided repair support that they claim they will do. It’s been three months since delivery. 

5. Fraudulent:
I filed a credit card claim to recoup some of my losses. Credit card company dismissed dispute showing me Merchant (1StopBedrooms) provided documentation that I acknowledged receiving furniture in good condition. Imagine my shock when I saw this document had a FORGED signature (I was OUT OF STATE at the time of this delivery.) How is this a real business with that many good reviews?!?!
Credit card company dismissed the redispute when I provided documentation (that I wasn’t allowed to uploaded in the first place) “because the window expired”. 
I don’t know how a credit card company accepts they made a decision based on falsified documents. 

Thank you!! 🙏

Edit: 
1) this happened in California

276,Is it illegal to say that you own a home when you don’t,Hey there this may be odd but I had an old man who is presumably the neighbor to the home I tried to visit come up to me and tell me that he is in fact the owner of the home I was trying to visit and to go away. So I did some background checks and find out he is not the home owner whatsoever and in fact lives next door as his main place of residency. So I went back and he stopped me again and said he told me to leave and that he is the owner so I asked if I could please see a bill associated with the address to prove he is at least affiliated with the home in some kind of way and he told me he doesn’t have to show me anything and that I need to leave or else he will call the cops. Now I do know that when someone tells you to leave and you visit that property again it is criminal trespassing but what if it isn’t his property? My work is not government work but I do have my permits and licensing in order and I am allowed to be there and in that area doing what I need to do. Any advice? Does this count as fraudulent activity for the neighbor?
277,Past Abuse?,"I just have a question.

I grew up in Minnesota and when I was a child I was molested by my cousin. I am now 23. I just looked up info about statue of limitations in Minnesota and found out a few years ago they changed the law and made it so there wasn't a statue of limitations for CSA anymore. But I have no idea how to go about reporting what happened.. it was so long ago I don't even know how to go about this. It has severely affected my mental health as I have grown and I have only just started healing. I don't even know if I CAN report it because I don't remember exact details of the year or how old I was. (Under 10 for sure). Is it even worth trying? 

He has a daughter now and it just disgusts me.. I don't know what to do. I want to do something.. I should have done something years ago but by the time I realized fully what happened and how it was wrong I felt like it was too late to do anything.. I don't know what to do or even what I can do and google isn't really helping. So any advice or anything would be really appreciated.

Thank you."
278,Not paying work-shift related fines after moving out of cooperative housing enviroment.,"My contract for a 2-bedroom appt as part of a cooperative housing organization ends next month, after which I will be moving out of state. While I am planning to pay all rent owed, I owe additional money because I did not perform workshift obligations to my appt complex. Here is the section of my housing contract on workshift:

""Each Member is obligated to perform faithfully and as efficiently as possible all work assigned under the workshift system as part of the consideration in exchange for this contract. Any work performed under the workshift system shall be considered an obligation of membership inherent in cooperative living. Failure to perform workshift shall be grounds for termination of membership under Article 13, and a breach of contract by Member according to Article 8. Member agrees to pay the unit for the reasonable value of any workshift hours not performed as outlined in BSC and unit-level Workshift Policies.""

I was prepared to owe pay for 10 hours of missed workshift (about 200$). However, my appt complex uses a highly predatory structure which was not mentioned in my housing contract where missed workshift hours accumulate and are doubled after each pay period. I am now on the hook for over 1000$ in missed workshift fines.

I was wondering what the legal repercussions could be if I refused to pay these workshift related charges, while still paying the rent that is owed?"
279,ESA and a 'halfway house' (US law),"I have an emotional support cat. I was homeless and the people that were caring for him just threw him and my stuff in the trash. I've recovered him. I came back to a house that I am doing partial labour for and partial cash payment for, for rent. I do not have a lease. Nobody can take my ESA and I was told he has to be off property or it's a 'dealbreaker' which I'm assuming means I'd have to go back on the street. This is a Catholic church and a separated housing from the church itself owned by the Father. He has even said that church stays at church and this and housing is separate. Can I do anything at all so I don't have to get rid of my best friend?"

Property management said they cant just go inside because it isnt legal. 
We emailed management and yes, we were and are mad because our apartment is flooded and we cant do anything about it. They hit us back with 'Listen, 'our name', dont you dare me how to do my job! Your insolence will not be tolerated. If you continue, we will send you a written warning notice'

282,"My gf's grandpa passed. After his girlfriend was evicted, she sold many of his items and trashed the house.","Her grandpa did not have a will but, after going through everything, the court ruled that my gf's mom legally owned the house and my gf could legally own his car. Grandpa's girlfriend of 20-ish years showed up late to court for the eviction and was told she owed my gf's mom 300-400 dollars. She told the judge she refuses to pay it and that she moved out a month ago into the neighbor's house.

After court she went back to the house, moved the car into the backyard, and broke a random key in the ignition after shutting it off. She also sold a lot of the valuable items in the house and completely trashed the place. The house isn't very expensive, but it's still going to require a lot more time to fix up.

I went over there with my gf and her mom today and saw the state of the house. We didn't even know she tampered with the car until I tried starting it with the key we had, took me 20-30 minutes to fish out the tip of the key from the ignition.

There must be some sort of small claims legal procedure we can follow through for this, but I'm only 20 so I have no idea how to do it. She completely wasted our time and doesn't care at all."
283,was sent a general release document," 

Hi r/legaladvice,

I recently moved out of my apartment two weeks ago and have been waiting to receive my security deposit back. Today, I was sent a legal document via email, and I am having trouble understanding exactly what it means. I am hoping someone here can help clarify the purpose and implications of this document.

The document appears to be a General Release, where I, as the Releasor, acknowledge receiving valuable consideration from my former landlord (the Releasee). The document states that I am releasing the landlord and associated parties from any legal claims or disputes that may have arisen from the past until the date of the document, specifically mentioning a Residential Lease for the apartment I used to live in. It also states that upon signing this release, the Releasee will return my security deposit in the amount of $1,000.00.

To summarize, I moved out of the apartment two weeks ago and have not yet received my security deposit. This document was sent to me via email, and I am unsure if I should sign it or if there are potential legal ramifications I should be aware of before doing so.

Any help with understanding this document and what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
284,Artist scammed by “art show” - help?,"A family of member of mine is an artist, and recently applied to and was accepted into an art show in NYC. There was a hefty $500 fee to be a part of the show. 

Of course that sounds like a red flag now, but this museum has been putting on legitimate shows since 2020. She also spoke with numerous artists who showed their work with them, so she was confident that this was a real show. 

Flash forward to the day of the show. She shows up to set up her work, and it’s completely closed down. She meets up with the other artists, and some say they’ve been trying to get in contact with the gallery for days to no avail. 

It appears they have shut down phone line, though their website is still up. No one can get in contact with them.  Some artists mailed their art to the gallery, and it seems unlikely they’ll get it back. 

Whether it was all an elaborate scam, or if the company suddenly shut down and ghosted them is unclear. Either way, she’s out $500, plus the cost of traveling to and from NYC for the show. 

What should she do, legal-wise? How can she report this? Is there any way for her to get her $500 back?"
285,Dealership Service Center Damaged Part That I Now Have to Pay For,"So I took my car to a dealership service center, where I used to live, back in January of 2021 because I was having an issue. The technician stated that he believed he had repaired the problematic component, but advised that if the issue returned then he would recommend replacing the component entirely. Fast forward to now, and the same exact issue has returned again, leading me to suspect the issue is the exact same as what it was when it was last diagnosed by the original service center. I now live somehwere else, so I took my car to the service center local to me, and they are stating that the bolt that holds the component that needs to replaced on, is stripped and has damaged an additional connector that it's attached to, meaning I'm going to have to replace an additional component, which I was not expecting to have to replace. This component is the same component that the original dealership's technician disassembled and reassembled, meaning they are the only one that could have stripped the bolt and damaged the component and the additional connector during their process of reassembling the component when they worked on it. My question is if I have any legal basis here to make them pay for the damaged component that resulted in the additional connector also becoming damaged, when it wasnt damaged before they serviced it? I tried reaching out to the original service center that actually caused the damage and they just kept giving me the run around and putting me on hold/transferring me to different people without answering any questions whatsoever."
286,Just won my arbitration. Looking for advice.,"I was unfairly fired from my job last year.  I went through the usual channels through my union and ended up having to arbitrate. I just found out I have won my case and my employer has been ordered to immediately reinstate me. I am to be made whole. I get my position back, along with seniority, benefits, and back pay. Here's what I want to know: Would I be in any sort of violation if I quite after receiving the back pay, and will need to pay it back? There's nothing in the arbitration document saying I have to work any length of time, or any other stipulation for me. I just don't know if there are any laws that govern that sort of situation. If so, what's a good length of time to work before getting out of there?  I decided I no longer wanted to work for them after the stints (there were several) they pulled against me, in addition to the company going downhill since I've been gone (terrible working conditions, unfair treatment, etc.). Our union isn't the strongest and is overwhelmed with the number of issues they're trying to handle, so the company has been taking advantage. I'm not sure I'm going to want to stay very long, but will give it a try. I just want to make sure my money will stay with me if I decide I don't wish to stay. This is in NYS, btw. Thanks."
287,How do you kick out someone that's on parole?,"My buddy and his then live in girlfriend were talked into letting her alcoholic mother that was supposed to be going to jail live with them till she went to jail. He was led to believe that it would only be for a month. Him and the girlfriend are now broken up and no longer live together, but her mom is still in the house. The date that they were originally told was the date that she was going to jail wound up being just a sentencing hearing. Then a bunch of other shit happened and she finally went to jail, but it's only going to be for 2 weeks. He was under the impression that she wouldn't be coming back, but apparently she has to get approved for a change of address before she moves. How the heck does he get her out of the house? I don't think that she gets mail there and she doesn't pay rent. This is in central Pennsylvania"
288,Grandmother Selling Car with Will Stating She is Executrix of Grandfather's Will,"My grandfather passed away about 3 weeks ago and had a new car that is valued around \~43k. He left a will that states my grandmother is the executrix of the will. They held a joint checking account but she took his name off the account soon after he died (this was a mistake it seems). I have reached out to multiple car dealerships and car buying services (AutoNation, CarMax) but they can only make out the title to my deceased grandfather, as the title is in his name. However, she isn't able to cash any check in his name because his name was taken off of the account.  


It seems that although she has the will, she will also need a letters testementary to be able to either open an estate account or have the title moved over to her. This would probably involve getting a probate lawyer involved as I don't know how to fill out all the forms and neither does she.  


Is there any way to sell the car to some kind of private buyer (I.E. craigslist or something) that doesn't involve changing over the title to her name, but would allow the check to be made out to her?"
289,Florida Probate Question(Affidavit of Heirs),"Last month I filed a Summary Administration for my grandmother's estate. Yesterday I got a letter outlining 6 issues that needed correcting. All fairly simple such as 'place of death' I put the hospital name, as I had seen in all the sample documents I used as reference, but apparently I had to include city and state as well. The only one which gives me pause is, ""Petitioner failed to file an affidavit of heirs listing all the heirs of the decedent who would be entitled to inherit the decedent's property"". No husband, and 3 kids all alive. For grandparents I put ""none"" as they died 100 years ago and I knew nothing about them and for aunts/uncles I did the same because there are 13 of them all deceased, I don't know the dates of their deaths which would be required. I looked up her mother's obituary and found the grandparents names and years of death. I can probably get some of the information on the aunts/uncles but would they that just lead to me waiting a month to get the same notice, or are the under the impression she has more kids. I'm just really confused."

I still have yet to hear back from my works job accommodation department. We’ve discussed about the type of accommodations I would need and that was in February.. the lady from the job accommodation department that I had a zoom meeting with said she’ll speak to my supervisor.. the meeting between them never happened. How do I know? I contacted my supervisor three times since February and the most recent time was today and supervisor told me she hadn’t heard anything from accommodation department even though I’ve been CC/BC the accommodation department.. 

During this whole process I have also been in contact with my case manager from my works HR department and she said she can’t get a hold of the job accommodation people either?  How’s that possible. I’ve turned in all the required  accommodations documents  and they’ve all been signed by my doctor and submitted in February.. I work for a bigger company so I’m confused on why the process is so difficult. I’ve gave them more than enough time to put a accomodation in for me when I return back to work. If they can’t accommodate they can decline or communicate other option but no they have not been in contact with me for 3 months making me push my return date to a later date


What do I do from here? 

Tl;dr I’ve been ghosted by my work accomodation department after submitting all necessary signed documents  signed by doctor. I submitted those documents 3 months ago. HR department is separate from work accomodation department and HR can’t reach them either. Supervisor hasn’t heard anything from work accomodation department. This is making me push my return to work date each time..  What the hell is going on."

The hanger is simple it says “Ready to buy or sell? Call me today for a FREE market analysis”.

292,"House destroyed in hurricane Harvey 2017, neighborhood deemed not live able and city is buying everyone’s houses to get residents out.","Quick recap, house was in my fathers name and he is no longer with us as of 2013. Leaving me (19 M) at the time head of household due to mother not being able to work at that time. Fast forward to hurricane Harvey, flooded my entire neighborhood and destroying all of our materialistic items. No fema help, no life insurance from dad, overall horrible situation. 
Update as of today, the city said no one can move back into the flood zone or rebuild, and will buy everyone out. They have purchased a lot of properties plus a relocation bonus. 
Our situation apparently is different? 
Because the house was in my deceased fathers name, they refuse to pay my mother and buy her out. Even though she shows the death certificate and marriage certificate apparently that isn’t enough? 
They say we need to get with the title company and city attorney to have the deed switched over to my mothers name to be bought out. 
My opinion is I think they’re bullshiting my mother, and she’s not a confrontational person. My parents got taken advantage of all the time growing up because they are just way too nice which made me grow up the asshole to balance the family in a sense. My gut is telling me that a marriage certificate and death certificate should be more than enough to finish this process and get my mother paid what she deserves. I have the number to the city attorney but decided to jump on here and get some feedback before I jump in blind and look like a fool.
Any input would be helpful and appreciated"

294,Delegate a New York Power of Attorney,"My father-in-law is the Agent on a durable POA for his brother. His brother is dealing with dementia and I have been tasked to deal with his affairs. I’ve been tasked because the Agent cannot perform his duties due to his own problems. Further complicating this (possibly) is that the principal lives in NY, the POA is from NY, but my FIL and I live in MD. 
There is a section in the NY POA that allows “full and unqualified authority to my agent to delegate any or all of the foregoing powers to any person or persons whom my agent select”.
FIL would like to delegate all powers to me so that I may legally oversee the principal’s affairs.
How do we legally do this? Do we need to hire a lawyer to draft some sort of delegation paperwork? And if so, would that lawyer need to be NY based?
This is the first time in my life the internet has refused to shed any light on what I’m asking. 
Hopefully Reddit can provide some direction."

My apartment was in upstate New York, not New York City. I'm not sure if this was a NYC only law or for all of New York State.

What I'm reading, it says it applies if you rented an apartment on or after July 2019. I initially moved in back in 2015 and renewed the lease annually. I was also on a month to month for the last 3 years.  

My landlord provided a page for move-out instructions with the original lease which the landlord also forwarded me at move-out. It says they would send the security deposit within 45 days of move out. Does that mean I have to wait 45 days?

I moved out 20 days ago.

I had it planned out that I would transfer my existing lease to a friend and move out mid of month. However, when I submitted a request to transfer lease, Medallion just sent a generic letter stating your request has not been approved. I've simultaneously asked them to terminate my lease mid of month to which they verbally declined and said I need to complete/pay for the whole month of June which is a big financial obligation on me. Since my lease transfer is not approved, can I just give N9 and leave on 17th of June?

* Is this generic letter enough to prove that the landlord refused to allow the tenant to assign the rental unit?
* Would it matter if I give N9 now with end date of 17th June or does this clause not hold if 30 days of receiving the non-approval letter have passed?
* I have already given a last month rent when I signed up the lease, will I be given back my amount for the duration of June 18 - June 30?
* What would be the worst case scenario i.e. will I face any charges/fines?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

We asked them if the house had any prior issues, anything to keep an eye out for, any complaints the previous tenants had, which they responded saying no, and that everything is all up to standard with no ongoing issues.
Little did we know there is a massive ant infestation in the sideboards, in the floor, noisy neighbors, and below us resides a locked off basement which had supposedly not been opened in years and (*has no issues*) until we over 2 weeks have had multiple ant hives come out under our floors, the smell of feces come through the floor, disgusting dust come out, which the pest control treated our floor and outside multiple times over these two week but ants keep coming out.
Once this basement was opened, there resided
-Human Feces
-Food Bags
-Ant Hives
-Rotting wood
-Rat nests
-All insulation falling onto the ground
-Insulation not covered from our floor above meaning that insulation was in the air
-Rat feces in the insulation
-A piece of wood was all that was closing off this basement meaning a squatter has been in and out of this basement over this period of time

Mind you, they told us there was no issues with this unit or anything in regard to it, which is obviously a lie, we werent even told that a week prior to us moving in, pest control had to treat the unit.


If there is anybody at all that can give us some insight on what we can do about this, or what legal measures we can take, please i would appreciate it very much."

4) **April 2023** rent due in the amount of $**1750.** ""

The $1,750 amount was listed again in the email another couple times and we agreed that for me to move in I would provide $3,500 for 1st month's rent and deposit. When the lease came in, I frantically signed as I was desperate for a place, not thinking the price would be different in the lease. It was. They now have me signed as $1,795 a month. 

Again, I understand the position I'm in for not double checking the lease before signing. Don't need to hear about how I messed up as I am already aware, but seems like the original email should have been a binding agreement as well, right? Just curious if there's anything I can do. Obviously, would love to have my rate be $1,750 as originally agreed upon but in general because they made this mistake, can I demand any kind of goodwill credit or perks for the mistake they made? Any advice/context appreciated, thank you!"
311,"[PA] Electric company installed meter upside-down, is now charging me for seemingly arbitrary amount of electricity used","I moved into my current apartment in July of 2022. Since then, I've been paying next to nothing for electricity, apparently because the meter was installed upside-down. Looking at usage rates it makes sense, as I was billed for zero kWh every billing cycle. This cycle, however, they added 12,052 kWh onto my bill. How would I go about contesting that amount being added, as it seems arbitrary and absurdly high for a 2 bedroom apartment. Thanks"
312,"Friends lawyer has gone off the deep end, what is the best way to move forward? LA, USA","Hey everyone, this takes place in Louisiana. So, my friend is beginning a custody case and her lawyer has filed for custody, child support, and restraining order which was apparently signed by a judge yesterday (according to her lawyer). Today, her lawyer has announced to her over the phone that he will not be her lawyer anymore, he doesn't want to be a lawyer at all, as well as some personal insults I won't repeat here. She has already contacted a second attorney but he was busy and said he will have to call her back (she spoke to him previously when deciding on representation so he's somewhat aware of her case).

Is there anything she needs to do today before the courts close to help the transition? What happens if her ex is served by the court before she can lock down another attorney? (I worry for her safety and now she doesn't have anyone to ask legal questions to for the time being). Can she file a complaint against him (attorney) and what would that look like? Can she litigate here? He's being really unprofessional and making an already difficult time even harder.

Also, I paid his retainer to represent her. He told her he would give it back (and his parents are both high up in the legal realm in her area so I have hope that will be worked out fairly easily as they probably don't want this incident made public). But, if I do have to fight for the retainer, what steps would we need to take?

Unrelated, I'm also pretty pissed off. I wanted her to choose a different lawyer because she knew this guy had some personal issues but she felt he had his life back on track and with his family connections, she thought he would be able to navigate this competently. He did exactly 2 things (took my money and filed the first stack of papers) and then took a swan dive into insanity. I'm livid. I want to fire off complaints on every legal review site I can find (but I won't for now). He also was recently assigned a juvenile murder case from the state (he volunteered that info to me when I was on the phone with him to pay the retainer) so he's just fucking with so many people's lives right now! Vent over. 

Thank you if you read this far and thank you for any insight you guys can offer. This is still playing out in real time so I'm sure more info will come up as things develope."
313,"Rent Control Violation, No Lawyer","Hi there,

I live in a city with rent control. Basically, my apartment cannot raise my rent more than 3% per year. I confirmed that they had violated the ordinance with the city and my community's Fair Housing Council (a non-profit the city provides contact information for in the event of a violation of the ordinance). The non-profit recommended I submit a letter of objection and offer to pay the 3% max increase per the rent control ordinance, and request a new lease agreement. My apartment never sent a new lease agreement and began charging me their 8.5% increase though I had not agreed to it and sent the letter of objection. Fair Housing Council tried to connect me to a lawyer that was supposed to be trying to pursue a class action since this is a large property owner that is actively involved in suing the city because they feel they cannot get a fair rate of return due to the rent control ordinance, but that's still up in the air. I found out recently that this lawyer might be fraudulent so I cannot pursue the lawsuit and have no legal representative. Currently, the city website, the city and their rent control staff responding to me, and this non-profit, confirm that my rent increase is unlawful. The city even shared a letter they have sent to my landlord warning them they are in repeated violation having done this to other tenants.

I'm afraid 1) my credit score will be effected and 2) I will owe money back if my large landlord wins their court case against the city. I have no idea what to do. Any thoughts on how I might proceed to protect myself?"

Curious I try to use it on my girlfriends car, nothing, then my car an old Honda accord and the key not only opens the door but starts the car! It's not a perfect match but it's pretty close and works more like a jiggler key. Regardless it worked. Not knowing how this key made it to my box I waited for the mailman and when he arrived I asked if any dealerships in the area recently did a key mailer sales event as I was able to trace an identical key online to a photo of an event in 2017 in another state. The mailman said yes then proceeded to pull.a several page flyer from a neighbors box and it was the matching key stuck to it. This flyer was humongous, and I really don't remember getting one but he said had been within the last week. It's a neighborhood box with many slots so maybe someone else's fell down into mine? Anyways I live in a bad enough neighborhood and have had issues with neighbors all ready. Now knowing that all of them have a key to open and start my vehicle I'm losing my mind. I've pulled the battery connectors and several fuses to prevent it from starting but what can I do?"
315,Can Land Owner Sue For Property Damage In Car Accident?,"About 3-4 weeks ago, my fiance was in a low-speed head on collision on a country back road. This is in the state of Kentucky and the road is a single lane, paved with no painted lines. 

She met an SUV over a hill-crest and neither driver could see each other until they met at the top. Luckily neither was going very fast at all and no one was hurt.

However, my fiance's little car was recoiled over a bank and hit a landowner's garage. Now I've not seen it myself, but I'm told the damage to his building was minimal and he was very nice about he whole ordeal at the time.

My fiance's car was totaled and only had liability. We ended up signing it over to the tow company because they wanted over $500 for a 6 mile town. The other driver had full coverage.

Kentucky, being a No-Fault State, deemed no one at fault on the police report. It literally says that the crest of the road was at fault and that neither driver could have anticipated the other.

Now the land owner of the garage is filing with our insurance over the damage to the garage. Our agent says they may deny the claim if the other driver's insurance isn't going to pay anything.

My question is this: if our insurance denies the land owners claim, can he then come after us legally for damages to his building? We just bought a home and basically drained our savings. We really can't afford the damages, let alone going to court over it. 

I apologize if this is a simple explanation. I'm pretty uneducated on how all this works. Also, I apologize if I've put the wrong flair. I honestly wasn't sure. Thank in advance!"

317,My old credit card company “doesn’t know” where my refund went,"Hi! Trying to figure out what to do… 
In January of this year, I (26F) returned an item at REI that was $160. However I have yet to receive this refund, and at this point, I don’t know if I’m ever going to get it. 

Here’s the backstory:
The original purchase (which was from April 2022) was processed online through PayPal, which was connected to a [now closed] Chase credit card. From what I can gather, REI charged PayPal, who charged my old credit card company (Chase). 

When I returned the item, I asked if I could have the refund go to a different card. REI said no because it had to go to the original card. So, I waited a few days to see if Chase would contact me about the refund that they received on my behalf. I heard nothing, so I reached out to them.

To make a long story short: after dozens of phone calls of me wasting hours of my life talking with Chase customer service, I was able to have (2) “internal investigations” done. The results of the first investigation was that “Chase doesn’t have your refund.” The results of the second investigation said “actually we lied, we did have you refund, but we sent it back to PayPal once we received it.”

So of course, I contacted PayPal. I then had two separate “money traces” done with them. They replied to both of the traces with the same thing: “we refunded Chase when the initial return happened back in January. We have not received anything back from them since. If we do receive anything, it’ll go right to your PayPal balance.”

I check PayPal every day. The money is never there. So at this point, my eye is on the sender (aka, Chase) not the receiver, as Chase was the last company to confirm that they had the refund in their possession. Out of desperation, I sent Chase a formal letter with a full explanation of the missing refund. However it’s now been two weeks and I have yet to hear a word from them.

I feel like this can’t be legal… what do I do?"
318,Yard Maintenance Fiasco,"I own my trailer and rent land at a trailer park, the woman who runs the trailer park allows us to cut our yards by ourselves or have the people she hires to do it. Over the years she has increased it from 30 to 45 to 50 and finally 75$. She sometimes lets us know when to cut our yard, like recently she had told me, she emailed on April 4, 2023 to cut my yard, there were storms and rain in the weekend and part of the week so I couldn't do it at all. She gave me till April 10. I could not do it till the weekend so she had to cut it. When I found the email it stated that she would be changing the price from 50$ to 75$. This is a service from her.

what I want to know is can I do something about the price from her? 
Is what she did with the price legal?

Our yard is incredibly small and I would have cut it the weekend prior if it wouldn't have rained.

319,Real Estate Law Question: Do we need to remove the deceased's name from home deed?," 

Trying to figure out if my mother needs a real estate lawyer!

My father died in 2018. Both my mother's and father's names were on the deed to the house, and their wills were set up with a simple transfer of ownership of the home if either of them was to die. However, the will never went through probate after he died because there were no other assets to transfer (my father had a gambling problem and committed suicide, so there were no funds or other assets to transfer, and no life insurance etc due to cause of death).

We are unsure if we need to have his name removed from the deed of the home? His name is also still on the home insurance. Searching the internet has received mixed answers, and my mother doesn't really have the funds to consult a lawyer if this is something that is not necessary. She is in NY.

321,Claiming unclaimed property for deceased person?,"I’m asked these questions for my mother-in-law. I discovered recently that each state has a page where you can claim your unclaimed monetary property. Out of curiosity I looked up close family to see if they had any to let them know. I was looking up my boyfriends last name and saw his moms name. When I told him about it he said that the listing was actually his great grandma (his moms maiden name was the exact same as her grandmas name). There were two items listed, both appear to be mutual funds over $100 (unsure how much exactly). My boyfriends great grandma died in the early 2000s so these have been sitting around for a minimum of 20 years unclaimed. My boyfriends mom was willed money directly from her grandma and his moms father/the great-grandmas son has also passed away and left everything to mom. Can she claim this money as a testate heir or would it be intestate? How involved would the process be to claim the money? Is there a legal process involved? Does it become more involved if the monetary amount were to be significant?"

324,Unlawful eviction? (Texas),"I have a question concerning a family member going through an ugly breakup. We'll call the persons involved 'A’ and ‘B’. I'll spare the details but basically a small hole was put in the wall about a year ago and a crack in a door. This is a small, very old mobile home. I say this because the damage in question can be repaired with a drywall patch and a $40 door. Fast forward to the the final straw and ultimately the end of the relationship. ‘A’ called the landlord, told them about the damage to which they told person ‘B’ they have until the end of the month to move. ‘B’ decided to grab what they could and left the same day. Landlord is threatening to also sue ‘B’ and not hold any liability to ‘A’ while also allowing them to continue to stay in the residence from here out. Mind you, landlord nor myself know anything about who/what/where/when/why as far as the damage goes-none of my business and I don’t care. What I’m wondering, since both parties entered into this together (verbal, no written lease), can he evict only one party without any written notice, or allowing them to fix the damage? I’m not sure if this matters, but ‘B’ paid all the rent and utilities and everything was also in their name. Is this a legal eviction and is ‘B’ on the hook for any damages since they will not be getting their deposit and ‘A’ will continue to live in the residence alone?"

326,Required to use own Employer's insurance when SO's is better?,"Hello,

I am having a baby and have been at the OBGYN where I currently go for 3 years.  This year, because we knew about the significant medical costs, I was put on my husband's insurance which is much better than mine and has lower deductible/out of pocket.  (We live in the USA)

I called the OBGYN and they said that they cannot legally use my husband's insurance since I still have one through my employer and that is the primary one by law.  I have never heard of such a thing and it is literally the difference of thousands of dollars between both deductibles, both out of pocket costs, etc. 

What is the law around this? Can I just lie and say I don't have mine anymore? They said they would just bill to my primary anyways and only if it came back negative would they bill to my husbands.  Are there any ways around this?

I'm so stressed just going through all of these procedures I don't know what to do, and this is really stressing me out.

Thanks in advanced!"
327,Is a contract I signed void if...,"I signed a contract 9 months ago for Solar installation. Long story short, there's been nothing but issues and the system isn't hooked up yet and it won't pass inspection. So.... I'm looking to break the contract.

While reviewing the contract, I noticed it references a ""Exhibit C (site plan)"" and ""Exhibit D (equipment list)"" but neither of those documents were ever included in the contract. 

I reviewed the docusign link, contacted the sales rep company, and also the solar company. None of them have those documents included in the signed document.

Is this grounds for the contract to be void? Or am I the dummy for signing a contract without having those documents attached originally?

329,Can I rent half of my and my partner’s house?,"I purchased a home with my partner (not married) a couple years ago. We are now separating and I no longer want to live with him. I offered him to buy his stake and he said no. I offered him the option to buy me out and he said no. I suggested him to sell the house and he said no. He wants to keep my hands tied and I was forced to buy another property to move with my kids and leave our home alone. 

I can’t pay for both properties and he wants me to keep paying the mortgage for the first property, which I believe legally I have to. So I had an idea that I’m not sure if it’s legal. 

Since on the first floor there are two rooms that he is using as his bedroom and as his office/storage. On the second floor there are two rooms that were my kids’ and are empty now. The living room, kitchen, bathroom are common areas. Can I rent the two rooms on the second floor as my half of the house? He might not like it but since I would be paying for half of the house, I should be entitled to use half of the house however I want?"
330,Question about reporting on job application (IL),"I was arrested for a DUI several years ago. Got court supervision, successfully completed the process and was discharged. I'm currently filling out an application that has the following language in the criminal record section: 

Convictions include all felony or misdemeanor convictions, whether by pleas of guilty, nolo contendere or no contest or after bench or jury trial. Convictions that result in sentences of probation, conditional discharge or imprisonment must be reported. Convictions of driving while intoxicated or under the influence (DUI), and driving on a revoked or suspended license must be reported. But, convictions that resulted in sentences of supervision in Illinois or traffic offences, other than DUI, or driving on a revoked or suspended license, should not be reported (i.e. speeding tickets, running a red light or stop sign, driving without insurance, etc.). Finally, you are not obligated to disclose sealed or expunged records of conviction or arrest.

The way I'm reading it is that as I received court supervision, I should not report it. Does this seem accurate?"
331,Solar Never Fully installed. AZ,"This a long story but will make it short and sweet. Long story short. I hired a broker to do a solar install. We secured funding (Loan) for the solar and once that's complete we then get the specifics of the solar install down. I was promised and I'm sure its  was written somewhere I did not have to start making payments on the solar loan til the solar is actually turned on and Functioning (Common practice).

&#x200B;

Well that's not at all what happened. The issue started shortly after signing the papers. I had spotty communication with the broker (We have used him before and so have friends and family). After getting the electrician out to upgrade my main panel I no longer had communications with the broker and could not get a hold of him. I was in contact with someone from another company that managed the install from there. The problem really starts getting bad when the solar is first delayed to be installed. Panels where suppose to be installed and functioning by Sept 10th ish but delays on getting the panels got pushed to October. This is where the headache really starts. The panels where installed but not turned on. Power company inspection failed there install about 6 times over the course next few months. Take note I felt like I was forced to start paying the loan that december (2021). So I was not able to turn on the solar I had been paying for until June of 2022. When The power company inspector had enough of problems (His words) and finally was down to a super simple fix (wires were flipped) and tested and gave it the good to go. From there I have been in contact with the SAME guy  at the company (Who by the way after the green light stop responding all of sudden) saying they would reimburse me for the money I had to pay during this ordeal. That never came obviously. I would just ask for that money back and some due to the power difference it would have made but this past saturday (4/8/2023) things took a weird turn. We had a power outage which is normal for this area but issue came during the day (Most ours happen at night and while we are sleeping through it) so I went to look at the battery backup I have a little more closely. Come to find out its not backing up any circuits it just charges from the solar and thats it. The conduit is ran too ""look"" like its connect but at the top of the battery back up panel its not (If your under 6""4ish you can't see over the panel to realize this).

&#x200B;

Sorry if I lost anyone on the mess of events. So the question is what can I do about this? Can I sue for the ""possible"" difference in bill and back pay what I shouldn't have had to pay? I do have text messages from all this along with the promise made about back pay. Thank you in Advance. 

&#x200B;

Note: I ended up going out of my way and just installing the ""Backed up"" Circuits myself"".

Another note: I'm now looking into this because the battery issue mentioned above just put the icy on the cake to want pursue this as I was just going to put it in my rear view before."

They just needed my name, since i work with this dude for quite a while i knew he was sorta responsible or so i thought, later on i moved back to my hometown because at the time i was living in San Luis obispo CA. anyways, i started getting notices that i needed to pay for the bond, so i contacted K and told him if he’s been taking care of his bail, he said yes and that he would give them a phone call to clear things up and that was that, today, i received paper on the mail by a lady saying i was being sued  for not paying the bail, and that i owed an amount of 4000 dollars that for some people may not be much but i’m a 25 year old working two jobs and saving to move out, i really don’t have the income to pay that, I truly feel like i was played, and almost forced to sign this stupid bail, i don’t know what to do i’m freaking out, I can’t even afford a lawyer, hopefully someone with knowledge will see this."

335,NY - Unfair dismissal due to coffee,"I started working for a mid-sized (50ish employees) media/tech agency in NYC this January as a salaried employee, and it's my first job out of school. I generally don't interact with clients, but my boss does.

This week the coffee machine in the office broke, and on Wednesday morning my boss asked me to do a coffee run before a client meeting for some coffee, including 1 latte with oatmilk, and he gave me $100 for the trouble (they cost about $50), and he instructed me to put the coffee into our branded mugs before bringing them to the meeting. About half an hour later there was an accident and we were evacuated from office, being told to take the rest of the day off. I worked from home yesterday. Today, Friday, I have received an email to my personal email address from my boss' boss that I am being dismissed with 2 weeks severance, with a prepaid label to ship my work laptop back. My work email and slack has already been disabled, and my boss hasn't answered my calls and messages.

According to a coworker I am friendly with, a person in that meeting had a pretty bad accident, and they are hiring a cleaning crew to deep clean the whole office. I realized I messed up because when I checked the receipt and it showed that I had ordered a soymilk latte instead of oatmilk, and I guess this person is allergic to soy. I didn't even learn of this detail until today, and only through the grapevine, and obviously I didn't do this intentionally. I am truly sorry that this happened, and I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the person who I harmed.

But to dismiss me for such a small honest mistake seems very unfair, especially because I just signed a lease and really need the money and work is hard to come by.

What can I do?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just heard from my coworker that my boss might have also been dismissed which is why he hasn't responded to me (I brought the coffees to him in our company mugs, he brought them into the meeting and distributed them). I haven't admitted my mistake to anyone yet, as I am not sure whether the person who had the accident was the one who had the latte (I don't know who it was, but it's likely someone on the client side, because otherwise my coworker would have told me). I will be contacting an employment lawyer Monday, just want to know my options before that."
336,Unfairly terminated as a patient from dermatology clinic due to me posting “bad review”," I was recommended electrodessication for my facial moles. The aesthetician did the procedure and the area turned black and unsightly. it was a quick less than 5 min procedure. I was told the moles will form a scab and fall off naturally after a few days. but the moles did not fall off. They look the same in pictures like before the procedure but worse.I checked online and electrodessication done elsewhere had the patient’s moles flattened right then and there. But mine was still raised & pigmented a few days after the scabs fell off. It looks like a messy at home apple cider vinegar treatment. If I paid $100 to have something removed, it should be removed or atleast attempted to fix the aftermath of it on my FACE.

After the 2nd session one of the moles is still raised but bigger than original. I was told   The aesthetician  went deeper the 2nd session but why would you do that without consulting with me first? Now it just look like some acne scar. Why did a small mole needs multiple sessions and why it left a red bigger raised lesion after the 2nd session? At the 3rd appointment, they decided to not do anything and let it “heal” longer so I set up a 4th apt after 4 months. The after picture looks messy like it wasn’t done by a professional in a derm office. It’s upsetting.

—
 Then the manager called me stating she will cancel my 4th apt bc of the bad reviews I wrote. She made it seem like I was writing multiple bad reviews when I wrote 1 about my experience. Am I not allowed to share my experience on google?  I asked her why they can’t fix the problem that they created and her justification was that she doesn’t recommend further treatment due to my SKIN COLOR. Why did they go ahead with the procedure in the 1st place then?When I ask her why it was undertreated and still left a raised scar and discoloration, she had no answer. She said they will terminate me as a patient with no solution to the problem. Her reasoning was that this is not the “patient provider” relationship she wants bc of the “negative review” I wrote and she will discharge me as a patient and refund my $. That is no valid justification to terminate a patient. Shame on them for making me go to the clinic 3 times and wasting my time and moles. I had to deal with 2 wounds on my face for 3 months. Is that what they  do when they mess up, call and terminate the patient from further coming to the clinic Based on FREE SPEECH?"

339,Mom’s husband harassing and asking for everything in divorce,"Hi, I just don’t know what to do anymore. My mom and step-dad are getting a divorce recently. He COMPLETELY changed, he is a different person in the past couple months. He served my mom papers one month ago, today. They’re still living in the same house. My mom is the absolute sweetest and nicest person you will ever meet and he is being absolutely awful to her. He is demanding almost everything in the divorce, he’s been having an affair, constantly calling the police on my mom for things he’s making up, and he just got my mom kicked out of her own house today for 2 weeks. He somehow got a protective order on her for “breaking his things” which she did not. It just infuriates me that he can do all these things when it was his decision to get divorced and he’s having an affair and just on overall terrible person. I just don’t understand it seems like he’s “winning” right now. What can I do to help my mom? Is there anything I can do to get him kicked out? Anything I can do with the fact he’s having an affair? Please help, I just don’t know what to do and how to help my mom and it just breaks my heart. Thank you."
340,NEED HELP - How do I remove my phone number from a real estate property or understand my rights with the National Do Not Call list,"I'm at the end of my rope here so hoping someone can help here. 

For the past year at least, I have gotten about 50+ phone calls and text messages asking if I'm interested in selling a property in Florida. It's always the same property and they're also referring to me as ""Fannie"". The thing is....my name is not Fannie and I do not, nor have I ever owned a property in Florida.... 

I've had this number since roughly 2004, so I'm not sure if it would be that the person who had the number previously is the actually owner of this property since the calls/texts only started a year ago. 

At this point, I block every call that comes in but every time I block it a new one calls. I've googled the property and it's not for sale and my phone number isn't listed anywhere that I can see in association with this number. I've asked the people who call how they got my number and they get weird and just say that it's ""public record"" and usually hang up. 

Is there a way to remove my phone number from being tied to this property? I've been registered on the National Do Not Call list since 2008 (double checked this recently). I'm not sure if these types of calls are covered under that but I'm losing it at this point and saw somewhere that you can sue unwanted/telemarketing calls if you're on that list in small claims court and seriously considering it if it's an option. 

Please help!"
341,Car illegally crushed,"Hampton Roads, VA

Posting here in hopes someone might be able to provide some help or guidance. I've already called several lawyers and no one seems to deal with my particular scenario. My car insurance also denied my claim. So now I'm pretty much screwed.

The jist of what happened - my car was disabled in a business parking lot and ended up getting towed. Not entirely unexpected. The issue however is that within 2-3 days of my car being towed, they transferred it to a salvage yard and had it crushed. No contact or notice was sent. I only found out when I went to have my vehicle towed myself and found it missing. The business was kind enough to check the cameras for me to get an idea of when it was towed. When I called the tow company, the owner was a straight up prick and said, ""that cars gone buddy, it doesn't exist anymore"". I was able to track down the salvage yard that crushed it and they confirmed they crushed the car a little over a week ago. So from towing, to transfer to the salvage yard, to crushing was less than a week in total. The tow company only held the car for 2-3 days.

This was a fully registered, insured vehicle with the taxes current. Everything worked with the exception of the transmission cable snapping. Which left me unable to put it in gear and why it was stuck in a parking lot to begin with. I've already called and spoken with several lawyers. A few of which have said that the tow company definitely violated state law. That they're required to hold it for at least 30 days and send notice to the registered owner (me). Which the tow company clearly didn't do. But none of them handle this kind of scenario. Based on KBB the car was still worth $4600-$6000.

At this point I'm pretty lost and unsure of what to do. I filed a complaint with the VA attorney general's consumer protection but I have little faith that'll do anything."
342,Contractor giving me the run around and keeps delaying work,"First let me say that I am *way* too trusting and I know now that I didn't do any of my due diligence before signing a contract with this guy.

I contracted with a guy to redo the master bathroom in a home I just moved into. Everything was being gutted and replaced except the standup shower. New tile, tub, vanity, and lighting. This was back in mid-February. I paid a $5k downpayment on a $9k contract. Original estimate was 2-3 weeks. After 2-3 weeks, the only work that had been done was demoing.

I had told him I wanted hexagon tile, and he said he was having a hard time sourcing what I wanted. I told him to just order what I wanted from Wayfair and get it shipped. He said the contracted price was for tile that was $2/sq ft (not documented on the contract). The tile I wanted was $7/sq ft, and he wanted me to pay an additional $1k for the cost difference and extra labor for laying smaller tile. This was in mid-March. Like I said up top, I'm too trusting and didn't question this, so I paid the additional $1k.

Over the course of the past month, he has kept making it sound like the tile would be here soon, but then he'd always have a reason for why it wasn't here yet. He said he messed up and ordered the wrong tile, had to return it and place a new order. He showed up earlier this week with one box of tile and laid it, saying the rest would be here in a few days. My suspicion radar FINALLY was going off by this point and I kept pressing him to send me a tracking number for the new order. He hadn't given me any info on this order until today.

He finally sends me a few hours ago not a tracking number, but an order number. I decided to call Warfair and hope they would give me some details on this order. Thankfully once I explained who I was and why I was calling, I was able to give enough identifiable details about the contractor that they would talk to me about the order despite it not being an order I placed. Turns out the order for that order number was placed 2 hours prior to me calling them. It *is* the correct tile, and it all seems to be the correct quantity, but will take 1-2 weeks to be delivered.

I ask them about the prior ""wrong"" order, and they have no record of it. They see the 1 box purchase that he ordered previously that he laid earlier this week, then today's order, and that's it. I called my contractor to confront him about all of this. He kept saying he never lied, that he actually placed the wrong order that got delivered, and that the delay on ordering the new shipment was because of some issue with his account being put on hold that he didn't know about. So I ask for the email confirmations of the ""wrong"" order, and he mysteriously can't find them...said he must had accidentally deleted it (yet he would had gotten multiple emails...order placed, order shipped, order delivered).

It's one excuse after the other, and he finally exceeded even my gullibility in believing him. A 2-3 week job has now exceeded 2 months, and all I have is a demoed bathroom with new lights, 1 box of tile laid, and a corner shelf where the tub will go.

I don't know where to go from here. I just want this project finished. Wayfair confirmed that at least the order is placed, and it is correct. Do I have any legal grounds for recouping any of the downpayment and finding a new contractor to finish? The additional $1k I'm discovering was also over-estimated based on him telling me it would be $200 for additional labor, plus the cost difference in tile which should actually be around $500. I'm >$6k invested, and small claims court in my state is for $6k and less. Or, have I willy nilly agreed to too much and I'm on the hook now? All the lies he has told him he has no paper trail for and would not be able to prove."
343,"Probate, federal taxes (Pennsylvania)","Hello, 

I have posted here before about this issue, the post has been locked since, I have more questions so I’m posting again. 


My MIL parents passed last year. They left a house to her, a retirement account to be divided between the siblings and an old car. There are some other things but they are more of sentimental value, not monetary. 
I thought that probate had been initiated before since it has been months since the parents passed, but it seems that probate only started a few weeks ago. 

The money from the retirement account has been split and given to each sibling already, leaving only the house and car to be passed from the estate to my MIL. The parents(estate) owe federal taxes. The issue is, my MIL doesn’t have money to pay the taxes, she also has her own taxes to pay, besides the inheritance tax on the house. I’m not sure about the car situation, but it’s a very old car, probably worth $2k or less honestly.

We are working on getting the house ready to be sold, but there are other family members currently living there. So MiL will have to write a notice for them to leave so the house can be sold.

My main question in all this is, shouldn’t the lawyer have waited until probate goes through the court to split the money from the retirement account? Because that money could be used now to pay the federal taxes. What happens if the house doesn’t sell quick enough to pay for the federal and inheritance taxes? 
Also, my MIL mentioned that there was some kind of deal between her parents and the lawyer for him to be retained to do this probate process. Is this a thing that lawyers do? Or he said that so my MiL would hire him $ ?"
344,Please Help! Workplace Abuse,"Hi there, I need help. I was employed at a restaurant and while I was there I was verbally abused and harassed.

345,[Florida] I was scammed by someone in public. Do I have any form of recourse?,"TL;DR: I bought a fake sound system from a man at a gas station but I have his Name, FB profile, and License Plate #. Cops say there's nothing I can do but is that true?

About 2 weeks ago I was filling up at a gas station when a man filling up next to me leaned over and asked if I wanted to buy a soundbar out of his trunk. Stupid I know but he was driving a nice car and was very convincing. Needless to say, a lot of the red flags that I missed at the time are now blatantly apparent. He claimed that it was a great system and they even ""sell it at Best Buy"". He pulled out a little catalogue and showed a product that looked similar to it what he had in his trunk but he didn't let me look at it for too long. If he had, I might have noticed that Best Buy sells Sonos sound systems and what he was selling was a ""Sono2"". Googling it shows that it's a common scam pulled all over. The packaging looks super legitimate and inside is something that looks like a soundbar and comes with some papers that look like they might be instructions but upon closer look, are completely useless. The system itself has useless ports and no cordage that could possibly connect to it, only a useless old micro-usb.

He tried to sell it for around $500 but I talked him down to $150 (another red flag I realize). He tried to get me to pay in cash but I refused so he conceded and agreed to pay with Cash App. While he had his profile open, I took a picture of his account name and tag. As he was driving away, I felt a pit in my stomach that maybe I was being grifted so I got out my phone and managed to take a picture of his license plate too. 

That night, I tried to set it up and big shocker... it was a piece of junk. There was no possible way it could connect to my TV. I reached out to the cops and they said since it was done in public, wasn't prearranged, and was for only $150, there was nothing they could do. I did some digging though and was able to find his facebook page with multiple pictures of him as well as the company he works for (it's some kind of very suspicious looking health insurance company). I also looked at his license plate number online and although I can't do a full report, I confirmed that it matched the vehicle. I attempted to reach out to him on Facebook privately to see if he would give me a refund and as expected, he blocked me.

I've reported him on Cash App and requested a refund but they've since rejected it. He's also changed his last name to STFO which I can only speculate on what that means. I'm in talks with customer support right now but I'd be surprised if that led to anything of value. 

Is there anything I can do legally? I know I could take him to small claims and with that comes fees that would most likely cost more than I could possibly get back but I'm not entirely opposed to the idea just on principal. Any advice would be much appreciated."

348,CPS ADVICE??,"Hello, 
So long story short. My sister was married to this man who was an alcoholic & fought with her constantly, (never abused the kids but constantly abused her) she had taken her two kids (14 & 9) and went to my mother's house an hour away in a different state for 12 days to get away from him, school ended up calling CPS & the children ended up being taken away from my sister and placed with my father. CPS gave the case to a foster agency as I am sure they have a huge caseload. But that agency has completely left my sister out of the loop and has gone to extreme lengths to keep my sister from her kids. My sister has moved to a new house, filed for divorce from her husband and has had no contact with him at all, she has done hair follicle drug tests and passed them all. Today was court & the 14 year olds father was there who has been out of his life since he was 5 months old, requesting custody of him???? Has never even met this kid since he left him at 5 mo, or spoke to him Mind you, this father has been in and out of prison, once for being behind on child support for said child. 14 yo wants absolutely nothing to do with him & has cried to his mother to get his last named changed for years. The foster agency didn't say a single word to my sister at court today, and was completely rude to her but spoke all nice to the dead beat father, giving him paperwork, telling him all the steps he needed to take to get custody, etc. What do you know? Judge ordered him to take a hair follicle & we have another court date 3 months from now. We have no idea what to do to get these kids back with my sister as they are constantly calling us and her begging to come.back. I have called numerous attorneys and all are afraid to take cases against CPS. Also, this foster agency was just sued for 10m and lost due to fraud & not giving kids back so they can collect checks on them. Reviews of this place are filled with parents scammed by them. 
!! I understand there sounds like there is more to the story, but there really isn't much more my sister has been the absolute best mother,  but married the wrong guy and couldnt leave
 I also understand that there are alot of children that need to be taken out of homes, but my neice and nephew were not one ."

350,"Oklahoma City, OK - Dentist sent me a bill for $500 7 months after starting treatment, and after telling me the whole cost was paid by insurance and a deferred interest loan","Title explains it pretty well. I'm in OKC, I got invisalign back in September, My insurance paid most of it, there was about 1300 leftover that I would pay out of pocket. I got a deferred interested loan, and am on track to pay it off a few months early. However I got a bill from my dentist for another $500 for the treatment, and after calling they are saying that the bill is because the Insurance did not pay as much as the dentist expected and quoted, so they are forwarding the additional cost to me.  
I can pay it off, however I am trying to save up for my wedding later this year, and would really like not having to pay an unexpected $500 that I feel I don't have to pay. This whole thing leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and I don't believe there's any actual recourse. However, if anyone can provide some advice on how to confront this, It would be appreciated, if there's a chance a wayward Reddit post could save me some money, its worth it"

352,Boss isn’t giving W-2s,"My boss, we’ll call her “Amy”. She has been saying she’s working on our taxes and getting the employees our W-2s since like January. And when we didn’t get them the end of January, we started asking her almost every week when we were going to get them. Every time she would say, “hopefully this week” “I’ll check with the accountant” something along those lines. Well February turned to march and now it’s April and she’s telling us she can’t give us our W-2s but she has to give us a 1099 instead. And this was her text message explaining why. Can someone please make sense of this situation for me bc it sounds so sus and weird. 
“I am doing the talk to text since I am driving home. Please forgive any grammatical errors it may substitute.
I can feel your palpable anger, and I am truly sorry. have no control over this at all. I would never do anything to compromise y'all or withhold anything that is yours. This has just gotten to be a much bigger situation than we expected and this is why. We knew there was information missing that was going to have to be recreated after the tornado. When the new accountant started digging into everything and had all of the information that we have. She realized that the old accountant who had it for 2021 never filed any taxes. What I mean by that is he never filed our state tax, local tax, and federal taxes quarterly. So according to the federal government, you didn't make any money last year. What that means for us now is probably going to look like this. we will more than likely as per the accountants recommendation, issue you all a 1099. That means you are an independent contractor and would be responsible if you truly were independent for your taxes. Well, we both know I took the taxes out of your check. So basically what's gonna happen is that we will end up having to refund you the taxes we took out of your check and you'll be basically getting your refund from us instead of the federal government.
You will still file but hopefully it will just be a wash -if you do have to pay it should equal to what we gave you back in taxes. Does that make sense?
I had no idea this happened. I gave them my statements like we always have and usually the accountant pulls whatever we owe in taxes out of our digital account and pays it. I've gotten no information that said otherwise, so I had no reason to be concerned. We have received maybe one statement from the federal government that said it was a late payment and we owed $100. I know this is confusing. It is for me as well and I'm sorry that happened. Like I said before, I would never have done anything intentional to hurt you girls.
Y'all are the backbone of the studio and I have always said that. Let me know what questions you may have.”"
353,Speeding ticket charged more then a year after the fact,"So background I live in AZ, USA and was arrested for criminal speeding, going 20 over in a 25 zone. It’s a class 3 misdemeanor, but this happened in January of 2022. They finally just filed a long form complaint on April 6, 2023 and I have an arraignment on the 22nd. 

Statue of limitations in AZ to bring charges on a misdemeanor is one year So how is this legal? I’ve consulted some lawyers who told me ethically I should just go to the arraignment and ask the judge to throw it out based on the statute of limitations. I feel like I’m just being harassed at this point. 

Should I just shell out money for a lawyer anyways? How should I approach the judge during my arraignment? Bring a copy of the statute of limitations law to present to the court? Seems like a complete waste of time and the courts money to try to indict me on this. Statute of limitations is pretty clear I think."

When I did I was given meds for high blood pressure, heart medication and through lab and at home testing I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and severe sleep apnea. I am awaiting a follow up with the apnea specialist to obtain a CPAP. Since I’ve taken my meds I experienced episodes of sudden dizziness, high blood pressure and tingling sensation not to mention fatigue from the apnea. I requested FMLA and short term disability paperwork from both my employer and my insurance company. My company gave me 15 days to return FMLA documents, unbeknownst to me the doctors office has been closed for remodeling and when I call they left instructions to text the number. I’ve texted and sent the documents to the email address they sent me but I have not seen or heard anything back and now my employer may terminate me due to not having the paperwork I needed, to them it seems I have no called no showed for a couple of weeks despite me telling HR that I was needing the emergency FMLA, my fear is I’m working with a patient and if I have an episode I could seriously injure myself or a patient.

356,Real Estate: Foreclosure Surplus Disbursement among Joint Tenants in Common,"If there is a surplus generated by a foreclosure sale, those funds get distributed to the former deeded homeowners. In the case of joint tenants on a deed, the surplus will be distributed to two parties.

For example, party A put up 100k, and party B put up 50k. Are those amounts given back to the respective parties and then the remaining funds are split 50/50? 

Or does initial contribution not matter and the surplus is then distributed 50/50 regardless of the initial contribution of funds?"

360,Wrongfully terminated and discriminated against... Here's why.," **Advice needed and much appreciated.**

First off, let me give you a run down on what happened....

My mom hired an agency which hired me as their employee to get paid as my mom's caregiver. Mom is extremely displeased with the Owners of the company and their unprofessionalism, so she terminates them as her agency. My boss repeated to me ""You can quit."" ""You can quit."" In which I replied, I'm not quitting. I go into work to pick up my paycheck today since my mom has terminated them as her agency and my boss tells me she needs me to sign some forms. When I asked her what they were, she said that they were separation papers and what was marked off on them had an checked box that said that I involuntarily quit. I told her I wasn't signing the papers. Then she hands me a form that shows $50 dollars deducted from my paycheck for a background check. I reiterated again that I didn't quit and then she then forces me to take a shift with a client, either 6 or 12 hour shift for the very next day. I told her she can't legally force me to take a client, in which she says that I'm refusing to take an assignment and then asked me to turn in my badge. 

What in the utter bullshit was this?! and where do I go from here? I feel discriminated upon due to my mom letting them go as her hired agency, but I feel like I was wrongfully terminated. 

**Any suggestions, advice, or direction would be appreciated. And if anything, someone to validate how incredibly fucked up this situation was. <3**"
361,Vet told me that my dogs leg was fine and now he can't walk without surgery,"Austin, TX. So when I first got my puppy Rot, he was a rescue and had a bit of a limp in his hind leg. We took him to the vet to get his first visit and check his health and what not. I brought up his limp(at the time it wasn't very noticable) and he said it was nothing to worry about. Now it's been a couple months since then and we went to a different vet and they took x-rays because it's gotten a little worse. The pup walked in fine, had x-rays, figured out he never even had a socket for one of his hind legs. We loaded him up into the truck very carefully and when on the way home he started acting very different; In a lot of pain and whining a bunch. We took him back and they said the maneuvering for the x-rays is probably what did it but that it could of happened at the next fall he takes. The fact that it could have happened soon, I believe. The fact it was overlooked when I specifically brought it up and asked about it with the first vet is what really ticks me. We called them and they said that that vet is no longer with them. Now were either looking at surgery which will be very expensive or the other option... I barely make rent right now which is one of the reasons I asked the first vet if the leg was something to be concerned about.  Is there anything I can do besides the options I presented considering the first vet visit?

365,Co-Worker threatened to shoot up local college in my city and was arrested for it but was released within a day,"I don't particularly understand how they were released within a day and why they even had bond to begin with after threatening a school shooting on social media (the Tweets are still up and public). In these tweets, he both mentions the college and his place of employment. My job is aware that he was arrested and is doing nothing about the matter and I am terrified. He actually showed up to work a few hours after being released! I understand that it's innocent until proven guilty in a court of law but it will take 5 seconds of scrolling down his Twitter to see the evidence. I genuinely just don't know what to do as I don't really know my rights as a worker in regards to another employee planning to be a mass murderer? Am I within my right to feel unsafe with the company and do something about it legally considering they aren't providing a safe workplace environment?"
366,Does my former employee need to pay me for this?,"Last summer I was looking for a job, ended up finding an opening with an aviation company.  After having my interview they had me stay for a few hours and fill out electronic paperwork + make an account online.  Another day I went in to the airport security office and got fingerprinted, and one other day I returned to the office to take a couple tests online that lasted a few hours.  I ended up finding a different job so this is all I did with the company, I never actually began working.  As I'm filing my taxes for 2022, I am now realizing I never actually got paid and I do not have a W-2 from them.  Is this something I need to correct with them? I'm not sure if this counts as actual training that I need to be paid for.

367,Terminating a commercial internet & phone services contract w/ cause,"TLDR: New provider didn’t grant first month of service free as stated in proposal. Is this a material breach of contract?

I switched providers for my businesses wifi and phone services at the beginning of the year. Company prides themselves on excellent customer service as it’s very local. In the proposal the agreement first month fees and install fees were supposed to be waived. Install fees were waived however first month of services were not waived. 

I have contacted my business rep by phone 3 times. First instance no reply. Second time was told he’d get on it. Third time I called he seemed apologetic and said he’d take care of it. That was a week ago and still nothing has been done.

The contract is for 3 years/36 months. It does have a clause in it about termination with cause for a material breach of contract. It denotes that I would have submit a written notice and they have 30 days to cure the material breach. My question is: Is not granting me the first month of free services a material breach of contract?"
368,Non-refundable lessons with unavailable teacher,"I paid for private lessons with a teacher a year ago, on the agreement that it would be a 12 week semester with weekly lessons, over Zoom, as I am in the UK while they live and work in Massachusetts. 

These lessons were non-refundable, and I paid upfront over Paypal directly to him for all 12 lessons to benefit from a discount. 

It's now been a year, and despite reaching out frequently, only 2 lessons took place and it has been extremely hard to communicate with the teacher, who has been ignoring my emails for weeks at times (he is an artist and has been on tour etc., which I only learned over social media ! ). 

Recently, the only way to get a hold of him was to mention looking into alternatives to get a refund (he suddenly answered extremely fast). He offered to work with me to find a time that would work for both of us, including moving the hours of his other students to ensure that the lessons will take place in the next few weeks, but that the lessons are non refundable.

At this stage and after a year of trying to have a regular schedule for the lessons, I've lost patience and I just would like to get my money back and not continue with a teacher who barely answers me.
Given that he has not been providing the service I paid for over the last year and ghosted me for weeks each time, is there any laws that could force him to refund me ? I would only want the refund for the 10 lessons that he did not provide (which would still be more than $1500). 

As I said, I do not live in the US, which might make it a little more complicated.

Thanks !"
369,Wrongful termination/ Go to HR/ or move on?,"New York State resident. Country club kitchen employee, with the club 8 years, zero write ups, verbal warnings, none of that. 
Got a new head chef running the kitchen since November ‘22.

This new hire starts in the kitchen last Friday, work a portion of the line and banquets. I gotta train him to be in pantry during the day time. he’s never seen a kitchen before. It’s whatever. Unprompted, within an half hour, he tells me how he was offered $2 more than me to start. Taking that as the insult that it was, I spent my weekend looking for a second job and came across a listing for new hires at my current job, confirming that he wasn’t just making shit up. I knew for a fact this affected many other people in the kitchen who have been there for years as well, so I informed them in order to improve our pay this Wednesday of this as well. Yesterday I went to the chef and told him how I thought it was insulting and he told me five times it was a taboo topic. After that, it was clear to me he wasn’t going to take the topic seriously at all I asked him if that were the case could I at least not be expected to train a newbie that’s being paid more than me. I was sent home for the evening to discuss it today. In the mean time, last night during the rest of the shift, one of those coworkers also went to the chef to discuss the same topic. This morning I received a call from the chef where I was told I was being let go because the club is moving in a different direction. 

What are my options here"
370,Restraining order was not granted,"My friend (actually not me I’m literally asking because I care about this person) recently filed divorce and restraining order against husband. Helped her testify against him at the restraining order hearing, but the judge did not grant the permanent restraining order. 

We shared info about his alcoholism, his temper- destruction of property when angry, and scared minor child walking in on attempted suicide with gun twice. We shared that info amongst other details like drunken rants about crazy political conspiracy beliefs, copious amounts of artillery, and how he admitted to infidelity against her. Basically for over a decade, she’s been emotionally abused- gaslighted, to outsiders they’d see perfect marriage and appearance of financial stability but behind closed doors/behind the scenes he’s been an asshole to her… Over the year there have been red flags friends like us would witness: some she informed us about, some we picked up on ourselves. The guy has been cool to us overall so nobody has wanted to get in the middle, but after what happened recently that’s a different story. 

Lately things got out of hand where he’s punching walls and destroying physical property when they have disagreements. I’ve seen him get in her face many times, been scared what he would do to her. She has confided in me over the years many times how scared she was but was not sure what to do. She was trying to come up with plan to leave, but secretly as she didn’t want to rock the boat… Since their latest blow up, she finally got that courage to file for divorce and he has been making her life hell since (manipulation, lying, talking badly about her to others/making up stories trying to get them to think she’s crazy so he can take their kid). He demonstrates narcissistic behavior and is a smooth talker that has said things over the years to make her sound like just another crazy b**ch. 

The cherry on top of all this being that he’s taken all their money out of the bank, not paid the mortgage and other bills for months, and not paid money he owes other people for various things he’s sold (cars, claiming to pay friends for handiwork around the house and not ever doing so). I guess he’s always trying to stay in control. 

Anyway, the husband had threatened suicide twice and got aggressive, cops were called as prior event leading up to temporary restraining order and this court date. 

We let judge know we still care about this guy just that we believe he needs help. We also mentioned being scared of him retaliating because of this trial.

Everyone with a conscience has been scared of this man because of threats he’s made and physical ability to follow through on them (diagnosed bipolar on meds, who because likes hunting, has a room filled with weapons. Legal weapons but still weapons nonetheless).

Despite this, the judge would not grant the order (said much of the info was “irrelevant”).

What the ****?!

Is there anything she can do to appeal this? Her husband will want to come home soon and she is genuinely scared for her safety (retaliation). She is also afraid he will try to take their child."
371,Dental filler fell out during root planning,"I went to a dentist for root planning in 2020, and during the process, a former filler fell out. It was likely because they took it as my natural tooth and put abrasion on it.

They followed up with a new filler but had to clean up the hole beforehand. Therefore, the hole was made even deeper. I’m now under the danger of reaching the nerve if the hole is enlarged for even the least bit.

I was talking about this past due bill with them recently and claimed that the cost for the new filler should not be on me, but the dentist has not replied after more than a week.

Do I have the ground to insist? And how?"
372,"Got served papers for someone with a similar name, notified the court of their error and thought it was resolved. Then I received additional papers via mail, and now the court is not responding to my emails. Do I need a lawyer? If so how do I find an affordable lawyer to deal with this?","A few weeks ago a server showed up while I was working (work went to work at home for Covid and has still not called us back to the office), she served him papers for someone who's first name is my last name, and who's last name is my first name. As soon as she handed him the summons he could see the obvious mistake and tried to advise her, but she just said he was wrong, you have been served and left. 

I called the court to explain the mistake, then also sent an email to the clerk of the court explaining the mistake, the clerk responded saying she would forward the information to the people that needed to be informed and I thought the matter was resolved. 

A week later I got mail from the court that had been sent a few days after I emailed the clerk of the court. I emailed her back but no response, it's been nearly a week with no response, I sent 1 follow up email after 3 days but that also received no response. 

The summons is only a week away, it's in Niagara Falls NY which is over 2000 miles away. It's a child support issue between people I have never met but the paperwork is covered with threats of a bench warrant for non compliance. 

My huge concern is that at some point due to this mistake by the court, police are going to show up in the middle of the day while I am working and interrupt that which could get me in serious trouble with my employer and I really want to avoid that. 

I feel like at this point talking to a lawyer might be my best bet, but even a lot of the ""affordable"" lawyer web pages I have looked have snippets on them that are like (Get started for as little as $500) which seems like a lot of money to me. 

I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to protect myself from this mess and am hoping I can get some advice."

I was fired from the company 3/4 into 2020 - the manager reneged on a promise to me. It didn’t matter too much to me - it was a hostile work environment. Afterwords, I was busy with my new job, and forgot about what I had left for my 401(k). Going into this year, I found out that my plan was still under my employer’s name, and that they hadn’t rolled it over. I went to withdraw the amount, and I was told I could not withdraw the entire amount listed because I wasn’t eligible to keep some or all of the matching contribution.

376,Can my boss pay me half now and half later?,"Hello. My boss owns two businesses, one that has been operational for a few years now and another one that has been around for maybe 6 months, and I am the only employee.

The business that I am contracted with is new and my boss has zero knowledge regarding the work I do. I have 3 months experience when I worked the same job position at a different business.

I am currently working on a project that we've had since January, and I am currently 60 labor hours into it. Due to a variety of roadblocks regarding getting the materials for the project, we've had this since January but only have 60 labor hours in it.

My boss told me that currently the business I am working for under him isn't generating any money, and despite me having $1,000 pending to be paid for my hourly, he told me he can only pay me half of that now.

From what he's saying, he wants to pay me $500 now, then the other 500 + whatever other amount is accumulated while I finish the project.

377,[NY] Legality of leaving someone stranded in a town.,"This isnt a custody issue but it's related to one.

I have placement of my kids but right now they're with my ex.

The people who handle her transportation had their access to the kids limited for safety reasons.

Upon becoming aware of this they refused to bring the children home to me.

My ex has convinced them to help her return the children and they agreed but stated it'd be the last time they ever bring her anywhere.

Considering this statement and the type of people they are, I consider it a very real possibility that they may leave my ex stranded here as revenge.

It's a three hour drive from here to her house and I have no means of transporting her home.

If they were to do this would they be violating any laws in the State of New York? If they are we can inform them of this ahead of time in the hopes of preventing it from happening in the first place."

The complex is spread out over a couple of roads, one of which has apartment buildings on both sides. They're complete assholes on a power trip and threatening to tow any vehicle ""on the property"" that isn't registered with them.

I'm assuming it IS legal for them to require registration if you park in a parking spot in their lot (these are not something you pay extra for).

This is NOT something that is in my lease unless you rent a car port.

381,Insurance carrier declined my claim last year. Contacted me this year stating they made a mistake.,"I was involved in an automobile accident in the beginning of 2022 and the accident was determined to be my fault. My car was totaled and sent to a storage facility while I waited for my insurance company to handle my claim. The insurance carrier declined my claim because they stated that my policy was liability only and since I was deemed to be at fault I would be responsible for the damage to my vehicle. My car was auctioned off by the storage facility eventually and I defaulted on my loan. My credit score cratered because I was unable to make my loan payments and I had to borrow my wife's car or catch a ride to get around places. I was also turned down by an employer due to a failed background check and the reason they cited was the auto loan which was not in good standing. Life was sort of difficult for a few months, but I caught back up and everything is fine now.

&#x200B;

In March of this year I dug through some insurance paperwork and found my policy which showed that I had full coverage insurance. I contacted the insurance carrier and they admitted that it was an internal mistake and apologized profusely and promised to take care of things. I'm dealing with them on replacement value of my vehicle and they are using the market value of the car based on present values and not last years. Last year the used car market was hot and prices were much greater. They're also deducting $5k because they were unable to recover the salvaged vehicle. It was entirely their fault to begin with. If they'd handled the claim correctly they would have had the salvaged vehicle.

&#x200B;

Do I have any recourse for punitive damages? They insurance company acted in bad faith in declining my claim. I'm not getting anywhere with the adjuster's as they're just pointing the finger at each other. Should I have an attorney involved? Any advice is much appreciated."
382,"Landscape company used wrong color blocks for large retaining walls, refuses to fix it.","We hired a company to do a large renovation of our back and front yard (spending a little over $100k). Part of the project was replacing 3 retaining walls with stone block, costing us $16k. The color choice for the blocks was given to them via text message. 

The day they started installing the new blocks, we noticed that they were the wrong color. And they're not just off by a little bit, it's a completely different aesthetic. We immediately sent a text to the owner of the company and he drove over to take a look. A conversation was had in person where he said that the one we wanted would take 3 weeks to come in, and he thought this one would match our house better (which is also natural stone). We pushed back but he convinced us to wait and see what it looks like once the walls start going up. 

After one of the walls was partially complete, we again expressed our disappointment with the stone (in person convo, not written). He said he could bring in another color to mix in with the current stone, to help balance it out. We were reluctant but he asked us to give it a chance, so we did. The walls were finished within another day and we really don't like the final product. The quality of the install is great, but the block clashes with the stone on our house. We said this to him and he didn't see it. We hired a professional home color consultant who immediately told us the retaining walls clash with the stone on the house. She recommended either replacing the walls or painting the natural stone on our house (which the HOA will not approve). 

The owner of the landscaping company is now saying that we never expressed being unhappy with the stone until now. Even after showing him the text messages we sent him, he still says the in person conversations never happened. He's refusing to do anything about the blocks unless we pay full price for labor and materials. We'd be willing to help pay for some of it but he's doubling down on it not being his fault. 

We don't know how to move forward with this. We would prefer to find a resolution we can all be happy with, we aren't wanting to screw this guy over. But we also think that if we're spending this much money, we should get the product we ordered. 

How should we approach this?"
383,What are my rights as a property owner that has a town easement,"A few years ago I purchased my first home here in Connecticut. The property has an access road that runs through it which I found out is an easement to my local town's emergency services. This access road runs into the woods behind my property and circumnavigates the pond to access the marina on the other side roughly a little over a quarter mile away. Out of the 5 years I have owned the property not once have I seen the town use the access road nor have I seen them maintain the path through the woods which considerable overgrown right now.  Additionally the marina has installed a large heavy duty metal fence on the other end of the path around 2 years ago.

What I would like to do is to dig out the access road and level out my back yard in order to expand its usable square footage as the far edge of the access road is 10ft off the property line with the road being 8ft wide and runs for 130ft through the property. This is a lot of land that the access road takes up. 

Do I as a property owner have the right to dig out the road and plant turf grass as long as I provide a clear path for a emergency services vehicle to drive across the lawn and into the woods?"

i'm moving from CA to NY for less than a year and wondering the least hassle way to do it. i am moving with my partner while they complete a 1-year masters degree this september, after which we will return to CA. i am graduating my degree program in august and my university health coverage expires july 31. i do not have a job lined up in NY yet, so i will need public coverage in the meantime. a few questions:

(1) do i need to establish / demonstrate that i am establishing residency to sign up for NY public healthcare?

(2) do i need to get a NY drivers license?

(3) is there any legal reason or tax benefit to leaving NY in 2024 before the 184-day period that necessitates filing taxes as a full-time resident?

my partner's mother lives in CA, so i could feasibly set all my bank addresses there. i don't want to do a fraud, but wondering if i can do this legally if it is less than a year total and less than half a calendar year in 2023 and 2024. or if i'm making a big deal out of nothing and should just get a NY drivers license and cross the tax bridge when i come to it in 2024. all feedback greatly appreciated :\^)"
388,I was in an accident and they are threatening getting a personal injury attorney. What should I expect next?,"Last month I rear ended a mini van. It was very minor, even the cop stated he couldn’t do an accident report because there wasn’t enough damage. The tricky part is I was driving without insurance (I know it’s dumb, I was trying to get to work to do overtime so I could afford it, less than 6 months out of a dv relationship trying to rebuild but I recognize that does not excuse or remove any responsibility from me) I approached the cop to let him know that my insurance lapsed and dealt with the dmv and impound fees. I now have insurance so I don’t need to be reminded how dumb it is to not have it - which brings me to the point. 

The lady who was driving the mini van and her husband are now saying they need several thousand dollars. Half of which is for medical bills but they did not see any general physicians or go to an emergency room, the only medical plan is from a chiropractor who they told me themselves is a friend who is giving them a deal. And I don’t think there is much I can do about that so I have been trying to find ways to get the money, even looking into loans but I am still trying to rebuild my credit so I haven’t had luck. Now I’m not getting it fast enough and they are threatening to sue, which I understand but I also do not know what to expect or what to do if it does happen and I am unable to afford representation.

Do I even need representation or can I just not contest and let them garnish my check? I’m not trying to avoid responsibility, just trying to keep this fair and also avoid this being a lengthy thing everyone. I also am having a hard time thinking through things clearly because I panic and think that there is no way this doesn’t just go the worst way possible and ruin my life right when I’m trying to start it.

390,My mother is being barred from seeing her mother (my grandmother) by her sisters. Is there anything she can do to see her?,"Hi Reddit,

I just got off the phone with my crying mother (64) because she was just told by her mom (87) that she “doesn’t want her to come/I don’t want to see you” when they’ve been visiting yearly this time of the year because it’s my grandmothers birthday.

For preface, my grandfather died 5 years ago due to Alzheimer’s, and my two sisters, Karen and Jenny, have been taking care of my grandmother, Amy, ever since. 

She was never taken to an elderly home, Karen and Jenny wanted to take care of Amy themselves. Jenny bought a house right next to Amy so she can be there, and Karen visits regularly. It’s a gated community. And Jane was told that they won’t open the gate for her. 

Jane and Amy have always had a good relationship and never had a falling out of any kind. This news came out today, the day before my parents are supposed to leave for the 28 hour drive. 

As additional information, Jane and her sisters have never gotten along well. There was always  a lot of internal strife among siblings, and ever since their father died, it’s been going downhill. 

Is there any recourse my mom has to see her own mother? It’s obviously manipulation from my two aunts that convinced my grandmother that she doesn’t want to see her own daughter. Because there has never been any friction or cause for such action.  

My own thoughts are to challenge my aunts ability to take care of her and to try and get her into a home for the elderly. I also think my mom should push my grandmother asking for a reason “why” she doesn’t want to see her. The only issue is that my grandmother’s birthday is Sunday, April 16th and she doesn’t have much time not to miss it. 

She lives in Florida.

392,Landlord hasn’t *properly* fixed my AC/Furnace/HVAC for over 5 months,"For the past 5 months, i have been having basically a non-functioning AC/furnace system in my apartment (e.g., room temp is reading as 80 degrees, i change to cooling mode, target temp of 68 degrees and the fan to “on” rather than auto, and nothing happens). I have requested fairly frequently for the past 5 months to have this fixed, and maintenance will come in, look in the utility closet, do something (not sure what in particular), and the system will kick back on, but then almost like clockwork, about 3 or 4 days later, the AC/furnace stop working and it goes back to the same state with the same issue. And so then i open another maintenance request just for the cycle to repeat all over again. I believe there’s some kind of electrical issue or a deeper issue with the HVAC system as i’ve tried replacing the stock thermostat with one of my own with no luck. Which is about all i can do as my utility closet is locked so i can’t tinker with any of that myself.

It has become fairly miserable - outside temps where i am have been getting to mid 70s, and inside my apartment the temp is averaging around 80 degrees. So my patience has just about been exhausted. I can only imagine how miserable it’ll be once the temps raise to 90 or above. 

My lease agreement has a clause stating:

RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We’ll act with customary diligence to:
…
(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating, and A/C equipment;
…
(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay for damages for which you are liable as required by ORC 1923. 
…


Would this be in violation of the agreement? I believe it would but I worry about the fact that it *temporarily* returning to working (even if it remains not working about 80-90% of the time) weakens my case. 

Assuming the previous point doesn’t weaken my case, from i’ve read online, i may be able to go to my county court house clerk about a tenant assertion, affectively diverting my lease payments to the court instead of the landlord. Is that the best course of action/should i do that? Is there anything else I should do (like contacting a tenants attorney)?"

Ex reported me for rape at gunpoint in December, turned the phone in as some sort of evidence. Police say the phone will be returned to her when they're finished processing it since my ex ""advised"" them it was a gift so apparently it's a civil issue even though I've shown them proof that my ex stated ""his phone"" was going to be returned to me.

Phone was over $500 at the time, I dont know if it's even worth it to try and get it back. I'm using a very old android atm because they also Seized my S21 in december and I guess is still being processed by CCU for some reason.

So my question is, is the phone worth trying to get back? I have no idea how the legal system works so I don't know if I'd have to pay to take her to court for stolen property. Do I make a stolen property report even though the phone is already in police possession? And would witnesses and the proof of her statements be enough without a receipt?"
396,bank account freeze,"Does anyone know if a bank has the right to freeze a bank account for suspicious activity even after I confirm I willingly sent that money and am certain I know where that money is going? 

I sent money to someone I know in Egypt and the bank blocked that. They called me and told me they blocked it because of suspicious activity. I confirmed that it is not and that i know who i am sending it to. They asked me to who and why and where and what the money is being used for. I simply told them that it’s my money and i’m choosing to send it to someone there and that I am confirming that it was me and I was not hacked. They continually asked for all the details which started to irk me because I just confirmed it was me and i know who i’m sending it to, so why do you need to know every other detail about the transaction? I refused to tell them and they proceeded to lock my account for over a month. I called multiple times and they refused to open my account again until I told them why i’m sending that money. At this point i’m furious that I cannot even pay my bills even after confirming that I know where the money is going and I confirm that it was me. 

Is this even legal? To keep someone from their own money that they use to pay bills until they answer why they’re sending that money? Sure I could have told them, but truly, it’s none of anyone’s business why I send money where I do and I don’t know if it’s in their rights to freeze my account and keep me from paying my bills after confirming I did and approve of that transaction and that I know who I am sending it to."

398,Friends boyfriend is kicking her out of the apartment and she has no where to go.,Hello I am living in California however my friend is currently in South Dakota. She moved out there with her boyfriend awhile ago and she’s been a stay at home girlfriend since then. Things have gotten bad that he broke up with her and got with a new girl a week later who has a baby. She is currently looking for a job but it will take time before she gets one and can move out. He is trying to kick her out  and have the new girl move in with her baby but my friend doesn’t have money or a support system over in South Dakota so she has no where to go. Flying back to California isn’t an option either since she doesn’t have the money or anyone To take her in. Once she gets a job she’ll be able to move out but it seems he wants her gone as soon as possible.  Is there anything she can do to protect herself from getting kicked out at least until she gets a job and can pay for the rent at a new place?
399,Surprise Dental Bill,"Unsure if this is the correct sub for this so please let me know if not.

Back in january i scheduled for wisdom teeth removal and was given an estimate. seeing as how my removal was a month out, i was told that any problems or anything with insurance that would affect my pay would be told to me once i was in the office.

Cut to a month later, and I get to the office, sign my papers and pay my bill, which was less than my original estimate. It's important to note that I had my notebook app out to write down any info i would need to remember, but more specifically I was messaging my partner about my bill and how i was surprised by it.

now cut to current day, very slightly over two months later, and the surgeon sends me a bill for almost 700$, saying my insurance limit has been reached. I cant afford to just pay another unexpected 700$ and I find it weird that I'm being given a bill that I wasnt told would even have a possibility of existing


I contacted insurance and their response is that the surgeon should have told me and if they didnt I need to take itup with them.

What can I do? I've been told this is a HIPAA violation and I can dispute it but i cant seem to found out if thats true. I don't see any reason to pay this bill when I've spent two months believing it was all squared away, and I refuse to believe it took 3 months for them to find out if insurance would cover the deal.

Advice?"
400,When Someone unsubscribes from email,"I'm a realtor and my boss asks me to send emails from a different email if they have unsubscribed from the MailChimp one.

I know it's like a grey area, but I think it's illegal and need someone else's opinion."
401,Sister Suing me for Father Listing Me as Sole Beneficiary on his Bank Account,"Long story short- my father suddenly passed away 3 months ago. He was estranged from my older sister for the last 8-10 years and she refused to come visit him in the hospital before he died or was in hospice at our home.

My father did not have a will but did have a brokerage account that was carefully managed, in which he listed me as sole beneficiary. This fact took me several weeks to discover.

In the 2 weeks after my fathers death, I had the sole responsibility of going through all his computers, files and taxes to see if he had a will and discover what assets/debts he had.

My older sister was insistent on having access to my fathers bank account so to be transparent, I sent her screenshots of his balance. I texted her something to the effect of, ""I can't find dad's will yet but I assume that he'd want the 3 of us to split all assets evenly"".

My fathers financial advisor informed me shortly after this that I was the sole beneficiary of the account and my father set the beneficiary in person and gave his advisor several reasons why he wanted me listed as the sole beneficiary and not my siblings. He did this over a year prior to his death and was in good mental standing.

My sister is now claiming because I texted her that "" I assume dad would've wanted us to split everything evenly', that I incriminated myself and she is challenging my position as sole beneficiary in court. I was served with a notice by her lawyer yesterday.

**My question is**: how much damage financially can my sister do legally to me with this lawsuit? Can she drag the lawsuit out for years and simply drain the remainder of the account by costing me legal fees or will a judge simply dismiss this as frivolous and not allow it continue past a certain point? 

I do not want to settle with her. She is wealthy and has benefitted significantly from my fathers financial help over the years as to where my brother and I did not. She is going to receive a more than fair portion of the estate when all is said and done.

Points to mention:

\-My father was in good mental standing when he listed me as beneficiary and I had no knowledge of his listing me as beneficiary and did not sway or encourage him to do so.

\-I can get sworn testimony from all my relatives that my dad was not influenced by me or coerced into this action."
402,Lease start 4/15 but move in 4/8,"We moved in early to our new place, landlords saying they have to 4/15 to get us the place in good condition. Even tho they said it would be cleaned. There’s still no AC. Is this legal or do I need to wait till the lease start date 4/15 for it to be illegal?

can i get someone to inspect the place and force them to fix things?"
403,Friend created a website telling people not to use a business; owner threatening to sue,"A couple of years ago my friend hired a cleaning company to clean his house.  They charged him for 17 hours of work and stuck him with almost a $2000 bill.  My friend was appalled at the condition of the house and couldn’t believe how bad of a job they did.  He had primarily hired them to clean up the dog hair from a previous owner and there was still dog hair everywhere.  My friend took pictures of huge clumps of dog hair to document this.

My friend demanded a refund because he could not understand what the 17 hours was spent doing when the house did not look like it had been cleaned at all.  Several Google reviews online from other dissatisfied customers backed up this claim and shared similar stories about astronomically high bills with little results.

My friend created a website called “donothire(business name here)” and documented his experience with them with pictures, urging people not to use their services.  Over the year the comments section received several people commending him for calling attention to this business, once again citing similar stories.

The owner is now threatening to sue and - at the very least - threatening a restraining order.  Before this threat my friend took the site down.

I’m curious: how boned is he?"
404,HR Question,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this.

I (in NY) recently went to my HR director to make a complaint about a new manager. It was the first time I’ve ever gone to HR. She asked if she could use my name to escalate the issue because lots of other people complained about the COO but wouldn’t let her use their names. The day after she spoke with the CEO, I was fired. The reason provided was that I was not happy.

Is this legal? It feels like retaliation. Should my manager have had a say in the matter at all? I was never told I could be fired for this and even the HR director was floored. I’m not the only one who complained about the new management structure. I’ve never been spoken to about my performance or ever had any other issues at work."
405,Statute of limitations on Social Security Fraud- Complicated issue,"When I was 15, my uncle adopted me legally and was awarded money from social security. This money was from my deceased mother’s accumulated living wages. It was awarded to him as I was a minor and was meant to care for me. 

This living arrangement did not last long however. After 6 months or so I was kicked out of the house over a petty squabble over food. I ultimately became a ward of the state. My uncle no longer had custody of me. I ended up living in a group home until I graduated high school.

I discovered during a visit to my uncle’s house that he was still receiving social security checks. I opened one, as it had my name on it. He was still receiving money from my dead mother’s social security and continued to for about 7 years afterwards.

My grandmother knew about this and said he deserved the money for all of the trouble I caused him. 

My family is full of sociopaths and I have zero contact with them due to this and many other issues. 

Anyway I was wondering if anyone could offer legal advice. If there was anything at all I could do."
406,Insurance screwing me over,"I was hit by a vehicle with SF insurance and they deemed my car to be worth 900$ less than what is left on the loan.

408,"How to deal with situation in which my parents have applied for a welfare service multiple times while having no right at doing so, promising me that that money is mine and then telling me the truth?"," Hi, I got a serious question here. When I was younger I was eligible for a welfare service due to private circumstances and fast forwarding some years later I was officially not eligible anymore for that specific welfare service but my parents still applied for that despite that I'm not eligible. They initially told me that I'll receive the money so I can use it fo my future but after some years my parent told me the truth and that was that I'm not going to receive that money and they really need it due to private circumstances so that's why they applied to the welfare all the time despite I'm not eligible. Now I'm over 18 they can't apply for it anymore and they stopped doing so. They haven't plans to do it in the future as they need my permission and cooperation for this but I won't cooperate because it puts me into great risk that's uneccesary. Now I'm asking myself all the time how I can deal with this situation but I've no idea. I thought of letting it go because they already stopped and won't do it anymore but I'm confused. What's your advice on this? I lastly hope I was specific enough for you to think with me."
409,Dealership Fraud and Corruption,"I recently agreed to a “first time progam”on  a car in the bronx (Victory Mitsubishi) November 23, 2022. I had lost my previous bmw in a no fault accident where i was hospitalized. I went to the dealership because they had a 340i listed for 28,000. I went to finance the car as was told i couldnt afford anything close. A few hours later after speaking with 3 “Managers” They explain i can be apart of a 3 month program for first time buyers. Them and my sales associate said after 3 months with double payments 1000$ the “rental car from the program” would be returned as long as not damaged (still have not found this program to this date April 14/2023. I bring the car after requested by a financial advisor through  text on a friday. I show up she leaves after 20 mins before speaking to me and my new associate says hes done nothing after a hour. I ask to speak to a manager and he plays dumb then pulling a paper behind his back after asking me a jump rope of questions to say my credit isnt moving anything for less payments or trade the car in( mind you my credit was higher then the day i bought it that day . Nothing that was agreed upon on first day. Theres been multiple things as well as coverages that have not led up to true on tires like agreed on the day of purchase. I called the dealership yesterday and was told over the phone by a head assistant manager that they have no program after waiting 3 days for a suppose call from the financial ial advisors assitant. Any advice on a next step?"
410,Can HOA be held liable if they won’t let me remove a tree and that tree falls and causes damage?,"I live a neighborhood bordering a national park and the HOA has to approve which trees can be removed in an effort to keep it “woodsy”. I can appreciate that to an extent.

However I have a very large tree that is leaning over my house/the street. If my HOA were to tell me I cannot remove that tree, and that tree falls and causes damage, are they liable?

Of course I would make sure they document that I am not allowed to remove that tree."
411,Can’t take possession of car we bought,"In Rhode Island.  A 96 year old lady I met through my job sold me her old car really cheap, she quit driving and wanted it to go to someone who needed it.  We bought it in late February.  We left it in her garage until we got all the paperwork done.  It turned out she couldn’t find the title so we had to wait for that.  Our appointment at DMV got snowed out and it took forever to get another one.  Finally everything is done but she’s disappeared.  I haven’t heard from her since the weekend before Easter.  I called Easter weekend to tell her we could finally pick it up and no answer.  I went over there a couple days later.  No answer, Fed Ex package on front door stoop since Friday.  Neighbors haven’t seen her and mentioned her porch light hasn’t been on at night.  I called the cops, they had the fire department break in but she wasn’t there.   They had been no emergency calls.  I called local hospitals.   I don’t think she would leave to visit anyone, she was paranoid about leaving to go to the grocery store.  

So how do I get my car?  If she does turn up dead somewhere, how do I get notified?  I know the bank she used, I saw her lawyers name written down but can’t remember it.  How do I make sure that people know the car is in my name now?  Should I talk to the people at the bank because sooner or later they would be notified.  The police haven’t called me back."
412,Had a vehicle repo 12 years ago. Now collections is coming after me for full amount plus interest.,"As embarrassing as this is to post for anyone and everyone to see online, here’s my story:
I had a repo about 10-12 years ago. I was a very young man with no real life experience at the time, took out a small loan on a car and unfortunately fell into a situation where I simply just couldn’t make the payments. I had the car for less than a year when I decided the best choice was to turn it back in.
Well, I was clueless about what to do. I let the plaintiff and the law system take complete advantage of me. I had made a couple payments but always felt that it wasn’t fair and just stopped paying altogether. Since then, the loan has been sold by the bank to one or more collections agencies and, recently, one of them has been sending me letters for an amount that is the highest I’ve ever seen it.
I have a family (3 children and a baby soon to be born) for which my paychecks provide for. I budget very responsibly to make my life work and I basically live week to week on my checks with barely enough to contribute to a savings, if anything at all on a lucky month.
I know the bank and the collections agency don’t need my money anywhere near as much as my children and I do. Looking back, I want to cry for and fight for my younger self having had nobody to look after me in that situation. Poor kid. I would never let something like this happen to my children.
Is there anything that I can do to get out of this? I’m being 100% honest here when I say I cannot afford this and I do not feel that it’s right that I should have to pay this substantial amount of money for a car I had for maybe ten months.
Trying to repost this since I stupidly did not read the rules before posting the first time. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
413,Can I get in serious legal trouble if I take responsibility for son's speeding ticket?,"My son was issued a ticket driving in excess of 30 mph in PA.  The car is in my name and the officer wrote the ticket out to me - a woman instead of a 25 year old man.  I paid the ticket for him because he doesn't have a credit card and I didn't notice the ticket was made out to me as the driver. I've since discovered that I will have to file a summary appeal to change guilty plea, but still have to take points test because I only have 30 days and appeal could take longer.  A lawyer wants at least $1,500 to help.  I also have to attend a hearing with PennDot over the phone.  My son has other points for speeding and will lose his license.  My son is on our insurance and I'm guessing it will go up more with him getting the ticket than me. My husband thinks I should just take the ticket and basically lie on the phone call due to all the time and bother to try to get this fixed. I've tried to find online info about consequences if caught but can't find anything.  Anyone know the rules around this?"

Im trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Is this something that could fail a background check, even though I have excellent credit and a great renting history? Is it an option to just have my girlfriend’s name on the lease? She has enough income to meet 3x month rent. Will I be breaking any rules by living there while not on the lease? I’m worried about asking the potential landlord these questions without bringing up red flags. Thanks for your help!"
416,Work for big corporation and think I’m being targeted,"Ive had trouble with management after a few months of joining they replaced my old team leader and the treatment has been worse since, he was a welder like me then got promoted to this position, everything was fine until the apprentices from another site, the same site my team leader came from, and who used to work with them came. Everything changed after that all the work I was doing was taken away from me and gave to the apprentices for weeks and then months this when on. As the days when on I became more and more stressed and sleep got so bad that I would of been lucky to get at least 2hrs a night and waking knowing I’d be spending my day trying to occupy myself as little to no work was given or any work I was given any undesirable work that other didn’t want. 

Things got that bad I was suffering severe migraines for weeks at a time and started to get physically sick on a regular basis to the point I missed days of work and lost wages which just added to my anxiety. So I decided I get help and went to my doctor and I’m now in the process of getting an ADHD diagnosis and finding out that the effects of being starved of work or and any form of cognitive challenges has a massive negative effect on my mental and physical well-being all so my team leader could look after his mates at the expense of me. I have always worked with my hands and worked hard and now I know it’s because I needed to. So after I got some help things started to get a bit easier as the more I got to understand what was happening to me, I make all the changes I could to improve my condition and after some time off for Christmas holidays I came back to work like a new man until things when back to normal, 

I was asked to if I would help the company out and go to a supplier company that were behind on main production parts that we needed to start a machines so it was a big deal. 

so 4 others and myself when and after a few days I got a text message from team leader asking did you have to be spoken to by James to which I replied “no who is James? no-one has said anything to me”then he replied telling me that James was approached by the supplier company’s management and told him to have a word with me as I was supposed to be standing chatting and not working, which I knew was untrue so I got really upset at this and decided to go and investigate for myself before I contacted my team leader again. I went straight to management of the supplier and got all three of them to the one side and told them that I had been reported to my management and asked why and if they had any concerns that they could come to me directly, to there bewilderment they did not have any knowledge of this and were quick to tell that it couldn’t be father from the truth and that they were more than happy with my work and I haven’t lifted my head since I started. They even reassured me that they would contact the top management to let them know as much.

I asked them who James was to find out that he was one of my fellow employees that came up from another site that so happened to work with my team leader the same one that messaged me so with this information I rang my team leader to see what this was all about for having my work ethic questioned and being made to feel I was trouble was stressing me to no end, when I rang I asked him where did this come from and he told me that it came from top management and that it was the suppliers top management that reported to them, which was a complete lie and found that it was in fact james a young lad in his 20s that was sending this misinformation to which my team leader tried to cover for aswel feel the need to attack me and make me feel shit so I’m sure that not know things should be. So I contacted management above him and told him everything and asked that he report it so I continued to work a few weeks with the supplier before going back to main site, once I got there I confronted him about everything and again stuck to his lie and told me I was lucky to have a job but I told him I was going to management about it and he changed his tune so I thought I’d give him a second chance. 
I returned back to work with good reports of my work with the supplier to be put into a role with added responsibilities and increased work load instead of being moved to price work which is where the most money is made as you payed for the work you produce instead of an hourly rate, I have been doing the role for few months without anyone explaining why or any training for the new role for to then find out that the same apprentices that got all my production work, that would of progressed me onto price work, we’re getting put on price work before me and and that I would be doing this new demanding role from now on I was then told that everyone was impressed my work and efforts in this new role but when I asked if I would be getting a pay increase. I was told no that there would be nothing extra for the role I then told my management that I would have to decline the role as they know i joined for the purpose of getting on to price work I was told they would see what they can do, this was weeks after and still no communication, so I started to feel once again I had been forgotten about so I messaged my manager to express my concerns with how I’ve been treated and the effects it’s having on my mental health and that I would like a meeting to get this addressed.

My manager then rang me screaming and swearing at me down the phone telling me that he had never heard such nonsense in his life and that I was Lucky to have a job and that if I wanted a meeting with HR that he will arrange it and that HR would side with him.

I was completely shocked at this and have been going out my mind since and I’m starting to feel that management has been part the problem the whole time, he  is the manager that I have been reporting my team leader to and since I got back, I have heard nothing about the incident. I asked him to report.

So, if anybody could please give me anything that might help as I don’t want lose my job or have my mental health continue to deteriorate. I feel so lost. I have no one to turn to I cannot go to management and it also seems that HR is also on their side. I have a lot of people depending on me and alI I want is to work in peace and be treated the same as anyone else, I work hard, and do more overtime than anyone else as well as any job that is asked of me and any work I produce is of a good quality so my work is never questioned so I don’t understand why this is going on 

Any help or advice would be much appreciated thanks in advance"
417,"Treelaw - Massive oak dead, likely due to negligence from city contractor","Georgia, US

This happened in June, 2020

EDIT: It's not clear, but the tree belongs to us.  The city had an easement to work on the drainage.

Behind our house, there had been an ongoing drainage issue caused by poor draining from a new road that was finally rectified in 2020. I won't go into the details of this work, other than it was necessary, and it resolved a massive issue with sinkholes appearing in our neighbors yard.

During the construction, the plans clearly indicated that a ... i don't know 10-12' diameter? ... oak was supposed to be protected space. It's huge.

The city contractor repeatedly drove over the dripzone, compacting the earth, parked land-moving vehicles next to the tree, compacting the earth, and left concrete pipes on the dripzone, again, compacting the earth.  They also ran into this tree several times.

I have photographic and video evidence of this damage and behavior.

I also have a string of text messages (and emails) with city representatives about my concern about this tree, and repeated requests to follow up with regards to examining the health of the tree, including one from last year, stating that the tree is not dead.

This tree is dead. it still has old leaves on it from last year and has not started sprouting new ones.

My ultimate goal here is to just ensure that i have this tree taken care of before it falls on my house.

I'm also pretty mad / sad that the damage was done - we really loved that tree.

Thank you!"
418,Retaining wall upkeep,"New Jersey

I bought a property that has a retaining wall with an ownership dispute. In short, a small portion of the wall resides on my property, a slightly larger piece is on the property line, and the bulk is on my neighbors side. The wall is failing and needs repair or replacement.

My question isn't about the outcome of who owns the wall, which is a complicated issue (for what it's worth, I've tried repeatedly to offer a 50/50 arrangement with my neighbor; he declines) but what the resolution could be. 

This wall has clearly been neglected, and my neighbor has lived in his house for 20+ years. If a judge was to rule that we are both 50% responsible for the upkeep and/or replacement or repair of the wall, would any of my liability be prorated because of the length of time he neglected to do any repairs or upkeep on his portion, or will we just have to split the cost down the middle?"
419,[NJ] Question about commercial tenant and extending leases,"I am a property manager that helps with individual owners. I saw in an initial commercial tenant lease that

420,"Leased office modified, after water damage, to be drastically different from when we signed","Hello,

Long story short, a pipe burst in the 2nd floor office in our building. The entire building got flooded and everything had to be demo'd and reconstructed. We just checked our office today, which is days away from finishing and being ready for reoccupation, and we noticed that the floor is drastically different from when we signed the place.

Before, it has Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring (LVP) but it now has polished concrete flooring. The feel of the office is very different now. It went from an office feeling to a contruction/tech firm feel.

422,Bedbug infestation in Baltimore on an existing lease that I was added to,"I am attending a school in Baltimore and we've been a victim of a bed bug infestation basically since the moment I arrived and likely before, IDK exactly. It was not me my Romanian household is beyond clean, my roommate is simply immune to them or some shit he claims and the rest of the guys are legitimately stupid and/or don't care, so IDK what to do with them. The lease has been active for 3 years from an initial set of tenants who have now moved out, a new set is living there now for their second year, and I've joined the lease this past year, along with a couple of others. Given that my roommate is ""immune"" and I experienced issues immediately upon moving in, therefore it likely isn't my fault, who the fuck is at fault?! My housemates keep saying there's nothing they can do because they lease is active from before they moved in, therefore the bed bugs must be one of our faults and the landlord isn't liable, that the bed bugs came AFTER the creation of the lease, but that makes sense in an individual basis, where a family or a single individual are/is (a) tenant(s). What about in a case like this where the lease is historic, the bed bugs are NOT my fault, but are instead the fault of ""previous"" tenants who may or may not still be living here? How the fuck could I be subject to a lease that existed before my involvement as a conscious agent? If that were to really apply to me then it seems reasonable that I also pay two years of rent for the two years of active lease that I'm supposedly subject to, but that's obviously insane because I didn't live here and had no contract or connection in any capacity, but this they clearly don't understand as an argument against their defeatist conclusions. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated, I don't care if I have to beat the landlord, the roommate, or the housemates into submission, I just want the fucking bedbugs gone at the cost of the people RESPONSIBLE so that I can finally go home over the holiday breaks rather than staying in this shithole to preserve the risk of transfer.

&#x200B;

TLDR (because I suck at writing with efficiency and lack of emotion): I was added to lease in which bed bugs already exist, either from before the lease or from the people under the lease before I was added. My housemates say there's nothing that can be done and don't want to pay, and further say that I am also responsible for contributing to the cleanup. WTF do I do?"
423,Contractor Dispute,"In NY.  Contracted with a company to do a small concrete job.  Signed a very amateur contract last fall and provided 25% deposit.  Contractor built steps crooked.  I notified contractor before the forms were removed.  Contractor ""prefers to address (corrected in subsequent text to ""discuss"") and issues after the job is complete.  Makes excuses why they can't come look at the problem, keeps pushing back any discussion.  I threaten to stop payment on the check for roughly 70% of total payment (this is my only leverage).  I made clear that I intend to pay, but issue needs to be addressed first.  Contractor flips out, tells me they won't come back and tells me to sue them (with lots of colorful language).

Job is roughly half finished.  Stopped payment on the check so I'm only out the 25% deposit.  I'm not looking to recoup any of the deposit.  I'm slightly concerned that the contractor will come after me for the 70% even though the job was not completed (although this has not happened yet).  One option is we offer to pay for the work done (which obviously is going to be biased in favor of the contractor) to avoid any potential litigation.  Or should we just cut contact and move on?  Is it worth consulting a lawyer at this point or just wait it out?"
424,Mail fraud???,"So, my fiancé just moved into her mother’s vacant house, (Illinois) and discovered that her brother (the last occupant of the house) had kept a hoard of old mail from the entire time (5 years) he had lived there.

427,Any possible liability for helping an employee medicate themselves?,"I am a business owner operating out of both DC and MD. I have several employees, one of which has epilepsy (and they work in both states). They were just issued a new medication, a nasal spray, to be administered if they have a seizure. 

They sent instructions about how to administer the medication. I’m comfortable getting them in a safe space and calling their parents if a situation arises, but I’d like to know if I’m putting myself in a legal weird spot if I administer the medication and cause harm in so doing. Would a simple contract absolving me (and my employees) of fault be accepted legally? Is this actually a non-issue? Other employees (their direct supervisors when I’m not around) have also been asked to administer this medication."
428,Landlord say I owe him 6030$,"My landlord of the apartment I just left 2 weeks ago says that due to minor damage to the wood floor on only 2 to 3 planks of wood, I have to pay $6300.  Because it will change the entire floor completely.

 It's a bit crazy!  Especially since it's just 2-3 boards that are a tiny affected.

 Can I make an insurance claim?  This is mainly due to water damage that came from the toilet.  What do you recommend me?"
429,Mom put deposit on new home construction. Walked in to it partially flooded. Can she get her deposit back?,"Hi All!  On cell phone so apologies for formatting. 

My mom put a $60,000 deposit down on a new construction house in Sarasota County FL. She checked in on it while it was being built. Last week, she went in and the bathroom was flooded. She notified the builder and they said the water was turned off when the toilet was flushed causing the flooding. *This sounds like BS to me. 

She returns the next day to find additional rooms flooded. She was now told it was the hot water heater leaking. Later, she was told it was the water line to the refrigerator, which somehow ran through the entire house but was also assured that the refrigerator water line was not under the floor. (!?!)  So I guess it’s suspended in the middle of the room and is actively leaking but no one noticed?!?

At another point my mom was told by the builder the water was coming up from the ground as the house almost flooded during hurricane Ian but didn’t. 

Long story short, my mom no longer wants to buy the house under any circumstances. In FL one must disclose if a house has EVER had water damage and they will likely not be able to sell the house because of that. The slimy lawyer for the house builder told my mom that because she didn’t technically own the house at the time of the flooding, she didn’t have to disclose any knowledge of it – I think this shows how reputable the company is.

So, the home builder’s lawyer says my Mom is shit out of luck. They will keep her $60k deposit, resell the house for more money, and never disclose the water damage. 

My mom doesn’t like to make waves so she is willing to take a $60k hit. She was a public school teacher her whole life and this pains me so much for her. 

She doesn’t like confrontation and doesn’t want to get a lawyer involved. Yet, she trusts the home builder’s lawyer who says she can’t get her deposit back. 

I know these contracts are written to protect the builder, but might there be a defects clause, or a flooding clause (this is FL) that might let her out of the contract and let her get her deposit back?

She is not open to buying the house and reselling or renting. She is not really open to ANY outside the box thinking. She just wants to walk away regardless of the financial cost. 

Anyone out there know if there might be any chance for her to get her deposit back?  Or any ideas to mitigate a $60k loss?  For most of her life, she never even made $60k / year, which is also my current annual salary. It’s just so painful to see her lose so much when she did nothing wrong. 

Any advice is welcome!"

431,[MA] Character and Fitness Application Question,"Apologies if this is not the correct place for this question.

I am currently applying for the Bar Exam and I was wondering if anyone could provide some clarity to one of the following C+F questions, see below:

*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*

I have received 5 traffic tickets (3 speeding; 1 cell phone; 1 inspection sticker) that would all be considered civil infractions and not misdemeanors/felonies over the course of about 12 years.

For the three speeding tickets, I disputed them in court, meaning I made an actual appearance in court and was able to successfully get them reduced to a lesser charge. Since I was a party in a legal proceeding, I would assume I would have to disclose these; which is fine, I know they are not something that are going to DQ me.

For the one inspection sticker ticket and cell phone ticket, I did not dispute them and I just paid the fine, meaning I did not appear in court regarding these tickets. Does this technically mean I was not a party in a legal proceeding? I will likely just err on the safer side and disclose regardless but I am just genuinely curious."
432,Bit by a dog,"Yesterday morning I was at a dog park with my dog. A pit bull with a shock collar attacked my dog for no reason. The owner froze up and did nothing, holding the shock collar remote in his hands. I jumped into the fight and managed to get in between the dog and mine. In the process I was bit in the hand by the pit bull. There’s a deep puncture wound. I went to the emergency vet. Luckily my dog wasn’t injured. When I went to the emergency room I was charged $500 for them to clean and dress the wound and fill out a report to animal control. I spoke to a high profile injury attorney. They informed me my medical bills were too low for them to take the case. Understandable. I have the owner of the pit bulls information. I reached out yesterday and asked to speak with them. They still haven’t responded. The time off from work and ER bill is $1k. How should I go about this? I’m in California btw."
433,Expected Wait Times?,"Not a legal question...more of a question on what to expect from your own lawyer question.

I am starting a business, and started working on this at the beginning of March. While it will be a non-medical company, it is in the health field. I knew I would need a lawyer to cover myself and make sure I was doing some things correctly.

I had my first meeting with them on 3/29. They were impressed with everything I came in with already prepared, and all the info I already had. They said they were not used to most people being this well prepared, let alone a new business owner. I decided I would like to have them as my lawyer. They said they would work on an Operating Agreement for my LLC, put together a client contract for me, and then asked me to send them the three policies I already made myself (and needed to apply for licensure) for them to look over. They did let me know they would be on vacation 4/3-4/7.

Also, at the time of our meeting, I let them know that the ONLY thing I was waiting on to apply for licensure was to secure a surety bond (required by my state), and that I wanted to apply for licensure as soon as I was able. I finally got that at the end of last week.

On Sunday, I sent an email to them letting them know I have the surety bond and would drop copies of that paperwork off for their file, that I had dropped off other paperwork the week before, and asked them if they could look at the three policies I had made first (in regards to everything they were doing for me), so I could get my licensure application submitted. I dropped off my papers on Monday. By Wednesday, I still had not heard anything. I called and left a message with their receptionist along the same lines of needing word back on my policies so I can submit my licensure application. It is now Friday, and I still have heard nothing...no phone call or email.

I know I am not the only client, and I do not expect same day turn around. But I am wondering how long is reasonable to expect to wait for them to just look at it? Or even just some contact giving me an idea of when to expect to get it back? I really cannot move forward or do anything else with my business until I apply for the license. It has been a bit over two weeks since our meeting, and they've been back in the office a full week now.

I am seriously thinking about just applying for the licensure before even hearing back from them...and potentially looking for a new lawyer if it's taking awhile, and not having really any communication. :("
434,Washington state. Auto loan.,On 4/12/23 I purchased a new car. I traded in my old truck and got a loan for the new purchase. We signed documents for the car and auto loan with the loan coming from a Credit Union. I signed and received the keys to the new car and drove home. On 4/13/23 the dealership calls me and says they didn’t get approval from Credit Union and that we are going to have to use a different lender. Is there a way I can just refuse to sign the new paperwork and return the new car and have them give me my old truck back plus refund my down payment or am I stuck no matter what?

My brother also accrued about $1k in bills which went into collections with an online retailer.

He owns a home worth $150k (paid off years ago) but no savings, no investments, and a 20 year old car that's probably worth $1000.  There is no estate planning, POAs, or legal documents.  He had struggled with mental issues which resulted in his death and not having a job unfortunately. We all miss him ALOT.

I want to make sure that his home is not repossessed and his GF and minor child are not affected by the hospital or debt collectors.

I would like to contact the hospital and retailers collections department but am not sure how to negotiate this situation or even if I should reach out to them as I understand they can be very predatory.

Regarding the hospital, if I contact them, how can I negotiate this bills down?  He lives in PA but the bills are from an NJ hospital, so I can tell the billing debt to contact the state insurance he was under in PA.  I am concerned they might not even talk to me. How do I go about this?

OK So, I've never smoked marijuana so I have no way to confirm what I'm smelling to be as such. I just know the overwhelming stench of a skunk smell seeps into different areas of the front of my apartment throughout the days. My husband, who has had slightly more exposure to the aroma in his past, has told me it's a type of marijuana. I couldn't give two craps about if you smoke it or not BUT to have that foul smell in my living space is starting to become very annoying. Is this a matter for a police officer? Or should I start with management here at the apartment complex?"

440,My mentally impaired cousin is being abused by her husband.,"i’m not sure what my cousin has, but she is deaf.. hardly speaks and mentally she’s 5. she had a planned married back in 2011, and had her daughter in 2016. my cousin was under my aunt’s care up until 2017, when she moved out with her husband and kid. since then, the 3 of them live in a very cluttered and filthy room that they rent out. 

i recently saw their daughter for the first time since she was a kid.. she just turned 9 yesterday. she tells me that her dad hits her mom, and how he always comes home drunk. she tells me she has to pretend to love her dad or else “bad things will happen”. she tells me she remembers bad things from her childhood.. and when i ask her what memories she has, she says she doesn’t remember. she tells me her family fat shames her. she tells me she can’t communicate with her parents. 

to put it in perspective, her father is an alcoholic that came from vietnam so he doesn’t speak any english. her mom, is mentally not there so she can’t communicate. her father also takes her mom’s disability checks for himself.

she’s told me that her mom tried to commit suicide from the abuse from her dad. i’ve grown up with her mom and it doesn’t sit right with me that my cousin would ever have the mental capacity to try to harm herself like that. idk. she’s using so many curse words at such a young age and tells me “my parents don’t understand what im saying so..” and then tells me that she had to go to summer school but since her parents don’t know english she didn’t go.

After I finished replacing my tire with the spare, the traction control light went on, but I didn’t know what it was at the time. Thus when I hit a red light, I searched it up real quick, and when it turned green, I started going forward again but I was still paying a little bit of attention to my other hand scrolling through the article to find out what the light meant. Of course, it was a stupid move on my part, but this lasted at most 10-20 seconds. I was paying attention to the road as well, and after I found it, I put my phone away.

442,Are consulting agencies allowed to stop you from legally emailing the company you work at under them in order to report them? (Texas),"I work for a consulting agency that employs us with an extremely large tech company you know of and likely use products of and our company is wasting millions upon millions of their dollars by hiring people, training them for months, and then firing them or giving them a hostile enough work environment that they quit before they end up doing any work in production that actually benefits the company.

&#x200B;

It takes months of training before we can work in production and the turnover at this company over the course of 6 months is literally 85%.

&#x200B;

The company we work for directly has no incentive to care because they're profiting hourly off of every employee and they're keeping everyone silent so that the large fruit of a company doesn't ever know about all of the financial waste being committed.

&#x200B;

Not to mention they lie in the interview process about upcoming salary increases, upward mobility, a connection to get employed by the company directly (they would never let it happen) and also hybrid work (entirely stripped of any remote abilities).

&#x200B;

They said we legally can't email the client company about anything. Is this legal to keep us from that communication even if it's to report them basically stealing millions of dollars through their business practices?"
443,"Tow truck charging $4,000, is this an unreasonable rate?","To clarifying, I will not be paying this fee, my insurance will. 

This story takes place in California.

The last 2 weeks trying to get my car out of this tow lot have been a total shit show. 2 weeks ago my parked car was hit by a drunk driver at 3am. He hit 6 cars total, including mine, and likely totalled every single one of them. My car? I don't fucking know if it's totalled or not because it's still sitting in the tow lot 2 weeks later.

I called for a primary tow the day of the accident, 8 hours later no one showed up, and I had to call another tow company. By that time, the body shop it was meant to go to was closed and they didn't have after hours drop off, so the tow company took it to their storage lot, 17 miles away. My insurance agent promised it would be taken to the body shop the next morning.

For some reason, that never happened. A week later, my agent calls the tow company asking where my car is and they claim to never have towed it. Absolutely wild because they gave me a receipt for the tow. They wouldn't even look for it until I sent video evidence that my car was towed by their company (thank God we had that video). 

At this point, the tow company quotes my agent about $2k in storage fees and is now claiming they never lost my car and it was always in their books and on their lot. She says she'll get them the money, but for some reason that never happens and my car is still on this lot of another week.

I get a call yesterday asking when we'll be sending someone to pick up my car and im like ????????? I thought it was at a body shop this whole time?? The tow company says they were never paid and won't release my car until they are. The tow company won't tell me the cost of releasing my car, but my agent informs me they're asking for well over $4,000 and ""we will not be paying that"".

I want to report the towing company to the BBB, but I've never had my car towed before, let alone left it in storage for 2 weeks. I know towing companies are notoriously shady. I just want my fucking car off that lot and to find out if I need to start looking for a new car or not, but since I have 0 control over any of that, am I able to do anything legally about this company? Or are these charges completely legal?"

It's definitely not a scam letter, as I've received and sent things to my tax office with this address before. I do not own a business or anything of the sorts, so I should absolutely not be receiving tax records for anyone else. I am about to call the tax office, but I'm very concerned about them sending this very private info to me. Is there some other agency I should report this to in case they've sent letters similar to this to other people? This could be a very dangerous situation, and not sure if I need to make anyone else aware of it besides the office that sent the letter."
446,"Friends horse was stolen, officer said they can't get her back","So, my friend has a horse who they've had for over 10 years. She's had a bad injury that prevented them from riding her. They kept her as healthy/comfortable as humanely possible and even had a surgery done years ago to minimize any pain the horse might be feeling.

A month ago they noticed the horse was in way too much pain and felt it was ethical to euthanize her. It was an extremely painful decision, this horse has been a huge part of their life. 

Right before the veterinarian came, a woman stole the horse from the property they were keeping her and contacted them saying the horse was fine. This woman claims the horse is completely healthy and wouldn't acknowledge the pain she is in. She basically told them that *she* will let them know when *she* feels like it's time to euthanize and let them know so they can say goodbye.

My friends contacted the authorities of course, but they said since the horse is on private property, they can't do anything about it. That can't be right! I don't know exactly what kind of documentation of ownership they have, but I know there's years of veterinary records with the horses photo attached, shipping records, etc. 

They think the horse might've been harmed further by being moved to a new property. I think my friend feels dumb trying to lawyer up to get a horse back just to put her down, but this has been painful enough before she was stolen. They wanted to make a humane choice and had veterinarian consent to do so. It's like their choice to say goodbye has been taken from them and it's horrible. 

Is there anything that can be done for this situation?

Edit - thank you everyone for the kind and helpful answers ❤️ I'm crying, it's not even my horse but it's sucked watching my friend go through this and feel like there's nothing they can do about it."
447,Employer not allowing me to park in the patient lot handicapped parking. Forcing me to park in a far away employee lot on other side of hospital.,"I am a young, healthy looking employee with a handicap placard. I have an artificial hip and a metal rod holding my femur together- but I don't walk with a limp. However walking long distances often results in  me being unable to fall asleep as pain seems to creep up on me in the evening.

My employer (a hospital) is requiring all employees to park in a certain lot, which happens to be on the other side of the hospital from my office. 

I started parking in a patient lot as there are numerous handicapped parking spots there, and they are never fully filled. A parking attendant saw me park, recognized me and chastised me for parking in a handicapped spot. After I told her I had a placard, she still told me I am not allow to be in this lot.

I don't know if I should press the issue, any insights or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe Im the asshole."
448,Collision shop has been making repairs on my car for 4 months and keeps lying,"I reside in Wayne County, Michigan. 

In December I got into a collision while driving in icy/snowy conditions. I hit a median and my rear left got badly damaged. I submitted a claim through to my insurance the same day. 

Between working with insurance and looking up and calling places, I was able to find the collision shop i ultimately took my car into. I brought my car in for an inspection and they gave me a quote shortly after and said if I wanted to get my car fixed with them they would need to order the parts and that it would take two weeks to fix my car. I was able to keep my car with me (but couldn't drive it much since the car wasn't ""street legal"" due to the taillight being broken off)  until they received the parts which was about a week and a half later. 

I dropped off my car at the date they gave me and picked up the rental car that my insurance issued me. About a week and a half into the repairs they said that a part they ordered still hasn't arrived and that it might take another week or two. 

Long story short, they keep telling me this part would come in until I escalated this missing part story to the insurance agent that represented the collision shop (a few weeks later). I was then told that this part was out of stock and that no one has been able to get it. At this point I had to turn in my rental because my 30 day rental policy was over and I'm not in a position financially to be renting a car indefinitely. 

After a few more weeks, I decided to call Subaru who is the manufacturer of my car and I told them about the situation and asked if there was anything that could be done. The person I spoke to was able to locate a part and then followed up with me via email saying they shipped this part with next day delivery to the collision shop. 

In this time, i asked the collision shop if they could write me a letter for work explaining why i didnt have a car and they refused to (i asked about five times). I then asked if I could inspect and possibly keep the parts from my vehicle and they told me they threw them all away (and I know that's illegal - at least in michigan). 

Fast forward to this past week, I was told by the collision shop that my car would be ready today. I called asking for an update the day before and they told me it would take me an additional week and a half until I could get my car back because they keep ""finding more things to repair."" I asked to speak to the owner and we have a ""fun"" conversation. I asked her why it was taking so long if they overnight shipped my part to them a month ago and the original time frame was two weeks to repair my entire vehicle assuming parts were delivered. The owner told me they took two weeks to receive the part from subaru, I then told her I have an email from them confirming it was delivered the next day. 

I then asked why they kept saying why the part was missing even though I was able to get it the next day from the manufacturer. She told me that they arent allowed to contact the manufacturer directly (i dont understand this one but whatever). She then proceeded to tell me that she has had cars sitting in her shop for 6+ months with the same situation, then i asked why she didnt tell me or those other customers to talk to the manufacturer directly instead of constantly making us wait. She told me it wasn't her job... 

I also asked about the parts they threw away and then she said she would call me back. They ended up finding those parts. 

I had a consultation with a lawyer and he pretty much said the only thing he could do is write a letter asking them to make the repairs in a timely manner and that I couldn't do much cause they found the parts they originally lost. 

My question is: is there anything I can legally do? I still don't gave my car, I'm losing money on work because there is only so much I can do from home (I'm lucky to even negotiate that with my supervisor), and I'm spending so much money on rental cars every time I go out. I've also reached out to the insurance but they don't seem to care and keep referring me to the collision shop."

They reached out and said they have to push the start date because of bad weather so some projects were delayed and we said no big deal and agreed the for the week after Christmas for the work to be done.

At this point I’m thinking I got scammed. Well I finally get a response after the holidays with them saying oh we didn’t take any of our work stuff with us and we were out of town for the holidays and our truck broke down. (It’s a small family company that was referred to us by the local fireplace store. ) I’m like okay strange but bad luck on the truck I guess… they said we are first in line once the truck is fixed. I said okay home everyone is okay since the trucks engine caught fire. Two weeks go by and I don’t hear anything and I reach out and he says okay be there X day or whatever and then his daughter breaks her arm. Long store short now…he has been out twice to our house to do work but he needs to finish the main bulk of the work that we initially called him out for still and every time there is an excuse or some reason he can’t come… either health issues with him or his family, weather is too windy or there is a chance of rain or he doesn’t have workers to help. It’s been one excuse after another. Back in Jan I told him I’m done and wanted my money back before he did any work and he said he couldn’t give anything back bc he purchased supplies already. I’ve been very nice and thinking maybe he is just having bad luck. But this week was perfect weather and no one came out and today he said there is a chance of rain so he isn’t coming. I’m done at this point and want to know how to get money back for the work not done. The work he has done has been very minimal and doesn’t come close to covering the money we put down. He has only been out for maybe 3 hours total."
450,House stuck in buyout limbo due to park its in closing. I'm in Pennsylvania,"

I bought my home in February 2020. Presently I'm stuck in an ongoing buyout process. 

The land the park sits on is currently waiting to be sold to a warehouse development group. Through 2021 and 2022 Estes Trucking had attempted to buy the land but were shut down by the Township due to zoning issues and they ultimately ended up purchasing a warehouse somewhere else. 

Last August I had reached an agreement of sale with a buyer for the amount of $79,900 after fees etc. A few days before closing one of the lawyers for the land owners got involved and refused the buyers a lease to live there and the sale had to be declined despite the check being in escrow. 

Not long after a letter was posted stating the park would be closing March 7th of this year. In the letter it mentioned by law any home that couldn't be moved was allowed to be appraised at fair market value. I went this route and the home appraised at $72,000. I was told by one of the lawyers that payments would not happen until after March 7th.

March 7th has past and recently a letter was sent to a lawyer who has been assisting people who got buyouts from the park owners lawyer in which he accused the apprasier of not appraising the homes correctly and that they were seeking help from a used home specialist to redo appraisals. Also the lawyer stated that he was open to negotiating with people. I sent a letter to open negotiations only to have a automated reply tell me he's on Vacation till May 1st. 

That's where I'm at presently no clue how to proceed other then getting tied up in some class action suit. 

Any advice would be appreciated

There's so much more to this apologies if I did not make the situation total clear."

My intermittent time is approved, and we use a third party service for leave administration. I have the documents that show my intermittent time is approved each day I've taken it.

452,"During a divorce, are you allowed to ask spouse for the expenses that you spend?",I'm not getting any legal advice or guideline but my sister is going thru a divorce with her husband but they have both been living separate for the past year. Her husband is kinda abusive and was torturing emotionally mentally. Sometimes she felt scared to live with him because of anger and mood. He put his hands on her twice but my sister never reported to the police as she was scared of her relationship causing more problems and being worried what the society might say if she did take any action. So because of all this stuff they both lived in separate states until recently she received ex parte temporary order for divorce. He wants to get a divorce and move on. Unfortunately my sister doesn't have proper guideline on what her legal rights are. Her husband doesn't want to pay money for the things she has done. Like my sister got married in her country and she is u.s citizen but husband has green card. So my sister spend a lot of money with the paperwork for immigration and for the fees and greencard. She even was paying for the car and cell phone services but her husband just wants to deny from paying any expenses. His intentions were only to come to this country and get permanent residence. My sister feels like he has done fraud marriage to obtain residency here. She is not able to afford lawyer or attorney and doesn't know what to do next. She feels hopeless
453,Landlord in CA,"Hi,

We have a long-term (over 12 months) tenant whose lease is up soon. We would like to move in a family member and know that a 60-day notice before lease ends needs to be provided to the tenant. However, we were unaware of the AB1482  provision so did not include language in the rental agreement that specified we are exempt (private owner of a condo). Does this mean we need to offer 1 month of rental assistance?  Tia for your feedback."

455,I don’t think my attorney did much for me,"So I hired an attorney through a company  last month  to represent me in court for family legal matters I paid the 5000 retainer fee and we spoke on the phone for the 1st and last time on March 7th for no more than 5 minutes 

I gave him the run down of everything I knew because I didn’t know very much. I only know that I had mediation on the 17th of March and court on April 20th  because i had got a letter in the mail on March 4th from court  letting me know the other party went to court without me present and that they had no  proof that the petitioner served me.

On March 16th i got a call from the paralegal, and we spoke for a short period of time as well I gave her the case number and I guess since me and the other party are not married the case is not public for them to see so she had asked me for the other parties information (name and phone number)  I gave it to her and she said she will reach out to the other party and tell them to serve the law firm instead of me I had offered to get the paper work myself because I knew if the other party didn’t serve me he for sure wasn’t going to serve them she said no that’s okay he needs to serve the serve the law firm  and i said okay  and that was  pretty much the entire conversation.

So on April 7th I had called the law firm and I left a voice mail and asked them if  the other party served them she called back on April 10th and said no he did not court is next week on the 20th and a response has not been filed and they have no clue what is going on and neither did I until later that day on April 10th when I went up to the court building and got the paper work myself 

I went and found another lawyer that was right across the street from the court building  to see if they could take my case at such short notice and he agreed

So now I am curious can I get a refund from the attorney that I previously hired 

P.S Yes I know the other party still must serve me or my lawyer but me getting the paperwork for them would have at least gave them and myself  an idea of what’s going on and what to prepare for next week on April 20th"
456,Basement flood!,"Hello,

It all started when I hired a legitimate heating/cooling company to do a yearly inspection of my a/c unit. He came and looked over my  a/c ended up using my broken hose without asking for permission which ended up causing a pipe to burst causing my basement to flood.   


When I moved into the house the water Spicket was already installed and on top of the spicket it says freeze free. Also the water to both outside spickets are/were turned off before winter. This guy I guess needed to use the spicket and hose as part of the a/c inspection. So the broken pipe was leaking water and I use that word (leaking) very loosely water for around 30mins. There was damage to my personal property, to the wall, baseboard, and the water leaked into one of the other bedrooms and into the rug. The basement is finished. 

I ended up talking to this guys supervisor and they said this incident happens at least once a year.  We were able to clean the water up and get one fan down there. We had to call a plumber which there was an extra fee due to after hour, and a water restoration  company. Plus our home insurance company. From what was said this company has opened up a claim. is there anyway other advice I need to do in this situation?"
457,staff member giving minor student tattoo at school (NY),"Hello everyone.

At my school, a staff member is giving a tattoo to a minor student during school hours. The student is 17 and does not have parental consent. They are also not-formally trained and I believe they are doing the tattoo in the art room.

This is a private school with about 70 students in Upstate New York. 

This feels unsafe and I’m wondering if it’s reportable, but am also unsure as it is a private school which may make it difficult to do so."
458,Aggressive Dog in my neighborhood,"In the last couple of weeks, I’ve started noticing a new dog and owner in our neighborhood. Every time this dog encounters my dog and I, another dog and owner, or just another person, it immediately begins to exhibit dangerous behavior. It will lunge, snarl, and bark in a way that really concerns me if it were to come off leash. From what I’ve seen, it doesn’t look like the owner is doing much to actively train the reactivity.  I understand that some dogs have behavioral issues (we’ve dealt with some of our own!) and not all dogs have the best leash manners. However, these interactions are becoming a safety concern to me. Best case scenario I’m worried that our walks will no longer be peaceful, and worst case scenario someone could get seriously hurt. Is there anything I can do legally or otherwise?"

Last October I was going to visit my family late at night when I had to return home pretty suddenly almost at their home. I noticed i was being followed by the police and decided to go a different way then just immediately back onto the interstate. I will admit that when they suddenly decided to pull me over i did run from them. I was involved in a major wreck during the space of the chase and was in the hospital for well over a month. During that time I called lawyers and the police department multiple times along with family members calling on my behalf to find my items like my id and phone. I also wanted to know what would be done with me considering I did run from the police. According to the lawyers and even the police I called, I should of been arrested in the hospital. I was released after being in there for over a month and continued to go to rehab and work my way towards getting my life back every single day for more months until we are now. I suddenly find myself with my picture blasted across the news station claiming far more charges and claiming I fled the hospital and cops was unable to find me. I intend on turning myself in because they now have an arrest warrant out after a news station started investigating at someone else's insistence. My top points and questions are 

1. They claim they couldn't arrest me becasue they couldnt  find me after i was released from the hospital after 2 weeks but i was in the hospital for over a month. Could they not of arrested me in the hospital within 48 hours of me being awake from my major injuries?
2. They had my address and phone number but no one tried to come find me even if they was searching for me. They refused to provide a case number when asked during repeated calls, by myself lawyer and friends and family, until literally yesterday. I feel like they didn't intend on pursuing the matter at all until this case was complained about to the news and they investigated into the matter. 
3. I always thought and believed based on others i know of, that there is channels to go through for the police to arrest you while youre in the hospital and put you under some type of lock and key.
4. I have a lot of evidence that i did try to get this taken care of 6 months ago and fully expected to be arrested then and then when it didn't just carried on living a normal life of trying to recover and get better for my family. I also can prove some of the cops claims to be lies. 
5. is there any way that my evidence of cop mishandling my case help me to reduce or remove the charges thats wrong by not showing the news, or would it be better to clear the public portion of my name with the evidence of their mishandling going to the news that first ran my story

&#x200B;

im sure theres more and you can ask me anything and ill answer to the best of my ability. this is all just a shock to me and ive been awake all night trying to process and figure out a way forward."
460,Possible assault? Ex stuck their finger in my mouth while arguing about possessions.,"I (edit: 47f) moved out of my ex's (edit: 43 m2f) apartment this month. I am slowly moving things out. They refused to put me on the lease, but I lived there from 11/6/2020-4/1/2023. (Edit: They broke up with me in June 2022, but I have been sick and had a hysterectomy in late January due to a massively enlarged uterus).

I was looking through the kitchen for some of my stuff and they accused me of stealing food (edit: something they would never buy or eat). They have been trying to get me to leave behind all the valuables I purchased since moving in, like a (edit: portable) dishwasher and (edit: portable) laundry dryer. I told them I had receipts for all this stuff (and bank records of most of the money I sent over many years) and was trying to be honest and fair.

They advanced their finger towards me and put it in my mouth, which I didn't think they'd really do so I didn't try to escape. To avoid biting them, I moved so that their finger went in my cheek. They then hooked their finger behind my back right molar and commented on how I had my wisdom teeth removed. I don't remember if I stepped backwards or if they removed their finger.

They had said something during the argument about needing 48 hours notice to come get my stuff when I mentioned possible civil charges for all the things I paid for and money I spent on them.

After the finger, I quickly grabbed a few things and got out. I mentioned how bad their finger tasted to lighten the situation. I asked if they were serious about the 48 hour notice and they said just text first next time.

My current partner (edit: 46m) is furious and is calling it rape. I just want all my stuff. Previously we had made agreements about some of the furniture and appliances, but they didn't pay me the money they promised. Instead, they lied about money I owed them.

I am thinking of reporting the assault, which was three days ago.
I also want all my stuff, regardless of previous broken verbal arrangements or possible gifts to them to try to placate them.

They are a drug addict and have guns, but are basically non-violent.

I have no clue what to do.

Thank you.

Edit: I forgot to mention, this is Tucson AZ USA."
461,Is this slander ? Cleaning service threatens to publish a reputation damaging review on website,"We hired a cleaning service to clean our restaurant (Austin, TX). For the most part, the job was done almost as described. The summary is we asked them to come back and clean what was left plus other items that were not initially included in the job. They declined and offered a discount. We rejected the discount and only paid half of the invoice.

After standing our grounds for refusing to pay then, we received an email from owner threatening to publish pics of the job before and after along with factual information about the restaurant and names of the owner and manager who were involved. All of that was in the email. All info seems to be accurate but publishing such review will be reputation damaging to the restaurant as the ""before pics"" are troubling.  If this actually happens, do we have grounds for a lawsuit? They threaten to publish review on all of their social media platform!"
462,Hospital Problem,"Hi! I am going to try to type this as best as I can, I am still fuming over this incident: 

Last week, my partner \[23M\]\]and I \[23F\] visited the Emergency Room at a Medical Center in our state. It was the worst emergency room visit that I have ever experienced. Early that morning, my partner, Kevin, was having unbearable stomach pains. He begged me to take him to the emergency room. When we arrived, the nurse at the desk went through a bunch of questions with Kevin. Her attitude was dismissive, but I attributed it to being tired, so I dropped my concern. 

We were taken to the room and were greeted by Dr. “John Smith”. He came in and went through a series of questions. During this, he was rude, to say the least. His tone and his manner were sarcastic. After my boyfriend had said that he smokes marijuana, the doctor was adamant that this was his issue. My boyfriend relayed to him that this was not a common issue and that he has been experiencing this pain since childhood. He explained that it usually happens when he eats something that does not agree with him or it has been set off by high stress. Kevin told the doctor that he was not interested in taking anti-nausea medicine and that he just needed hydration. 

When the nurse brought the IV, she had also brought Reglan, so Kevin let her know that she shouldn’t put that in the IV, and that he was NOT interested in bloodwork. This was to Nurse Natalie. The doctor came back with his snarky attitude, saying, “What’s up man, you don’t *want* *blood work*?” My boyfriend replied that although he would, he does not think anything will come back (and he was right). He knew that the source of his pain and nausea was his stomach. The doctor continued arguing with Kevin about the anti-nausea medication, saying that there were only three choices for him to treat nausea. Kevin said that they all make him react anxiously and that it made him feel uneasy. He said it was an “indescribable discomfort” to both Nurse Natalie and the doctor. The doctor threw his hands up saying that that’s all he had, and to make a choice. Hesitantly, Kevin said that “Zofran was probably best, but I will take what you recommend” and the doctor shot back with, “That’s what I’m trying to do here.” 

When Kevin was given the medication, he began to have a reaction and began to have a panic attack. ANYONE that knows anything about a panic attack KNOWS that the cognitive process becomes rather irrational. He was scared, fearful that he couldn’t breathe, he felt uneasy and was hitting himself, the mattress, and was crying in pain and discomfort. I had to monitor him myself and do breathing exercises with him. During his panic, he yelled out “NURSE!!!” for her (or anyone) to help him. This was because he AND I pressed the button multiple times and no one came. There were a few times I had poked my head out for her, but she always had her back turned talking or was on her computer. I understand the chaos of the emergency room but that night, there did not seem to be much going on. The nurse came in and Kevin was panicking saying, “Oh why did you give this to me?” and “Nurse, I told you that I would have a reaction!” He was not screaming *at* her. This was a cry for help. She mostly ignored him, but said, “I did not force you to take this, it was your choice.” My problem is not what she was saying, but how it was being said. And her demeanor. At a later point, she snapped at Kevin to not yell and “learn to press the button” when he needed her, but she was not even paying attention when we did. We pressed it another time and the nurse made a comment like, “Good job, you learned to press a button”.

The doctor abruptly came in and told Kevin that he needs to calm down. He also told Kevin to stop yelling at the nurses. Kevin and I said that he was just calling for help. There was some back and forth, but Kevin asked the doctor to be nicer to him not once but TWICE, and the doctor said “No” and “No, I don’t need to be”. The doctor said that he had never heard of a bad reaction to Zofran in “all his years” and scoffed at my boyfriend as if he were lying. Kevin replied, “Well, here you go” 

The doctor asked Kevin what he wanted. Kevin asked him for something to help calm him down. The doctor responded with something along the lines of, “Oh, do you now?” As if, he did not believe my boyfriend. He also implied that this always happens when patients smoke weed and have a reaction. Again, we told the doctor that this was not weed-induced. He then had the nurse give him HALDOL. This made him worse. At this point, he is hungry, tired, and now agitated. He was screaming in pain and panic. He was crying that he never should have come to the ER and that he just should have stayed home. His phrases started to become suicidal at times, and I had to calm him down. 

The doctor came in and told him to stop screaming because there were other patients there. My jaw dropped at this. I said over and over and OVER that he was having a panic attack. The doctor said, “Yeah, I would say he has a *lot* of anxiety…” in a rude tone. I asked if there was anything to do for him, such as splashing water on his face or something, and he just shrugged like it didn’t affect him at all. He sneeringly said to him, at least two separate times, “Well, you’re not vomiting anymore, are you?”/”Well…at least you’re not vomiting”. 

Then, the situation got worse. Kevin was screaming again and the doctor came in and asked him “Are you ready to leave now?” This and all of the treatment prior to him saying that felt intentional, but at the very least, this was ***negligent*** on his part. He asked my boyfriend to leave because of his screaming. My boyfriend was in pain and was not being assisted whatsoever. He told my boyfriend that he was screaming “like a toddler” and that it “must not be impressive to your girlfriend”. He also accused my boyfriend of yelling at the nurse, which again, was **not** true. There was more cussing, from BOTH ends. It escalated so fast that I could not believe it was happening. Kevin tells them he wants to leave and to take the IV out. The nurse comes in and tosses his Visit Summary onto the bed. The nurse takes the IV out, and as she is, Kevin says that the doctor was “being an asshole to \[him\]”. The nurse said “Do not talk about my staff that way” and told him that he was being difficult. He said that he was having a reaction and no one was being helpful. She said to him, “Well, *you* need to stop smoking.” He then said she was being an asshole, and she laughed and walked out. She did not properly wrap the bandage on his arm because when he went to put on his shirt it instantly fell to the ground. There was blood dripping down his arm onto the floor and I pointed it out to him. This startled us both. He anxiously screamed for her to come back and redo it. There was still arguing between the doctor and Kevin, and I apologized to the staff saying that he was not usually like this and that this has been a long day. I had begun to say that he was tired from not sleeping and hungry from throwing up all day. The nurse interrupted me and said, “That is no excuse”. Amongst the chaos, she fixed his bandage and he was escorted out by security. Security was also taunting him, threatening to drag him out and also calling him names. I again thanked the staff. Although they were rude and apathetic to Kevin, I understand the enormous burnout that can come with the job and I appreciate healthcare workers immensely. I know multiple nurses among family and friends, some even from this hospital. I have heard many of their work stories and will never forget what medical workers do for us. I have been going to this hospital since birth and have never questioned my choice to hopefully stay with them for life. However, this experience has damaged my faith in this hospital. 

What also struck me as concerning was the doctor constantly looking at me to help him. My boyfriend was subjected to discriminatory treatment by Dr. Smith. During the consultation, my boyfriend expressed concerns about his symptoms, but the doctor dismissed his concerns and often looked to me to either confirm or deny his claims. He would give me sarcastic looks as if my boyfriend could not see them. This behavior was not only racially insensitive but also displayed a severe lack of racial, social, and cultural competence on the part of the doctor. My boyfriend's concerns were valid and deserved to be taken seriously, regardless of his race or ethnicity. No amount of training will change the dangerous underlying biases that Dr. Smith displayed that night. 

My boyfriend and I were regretful to have brought him there that night. He regretted signing up for this hospital, rather than another in the area. This was a stressful and emotionally tolling experience for both Kevin and myself. I believe that Kevin deserved compassionate and SAFE care. We later learned that his family has a history of bad reactions to Zofran. He was gaslit, mocked, and discriminated against during his stay. He did not feel safe and was consistently being egged on by the staff. The ignorance of mental health within the emergency room was clear that night, and I will *never* recommend someone to visit this emergency room. 

Kevin continued to experience pain until the following afternoon. We were thankfully helped by the kind nurses and doctor in Urgent Care.

My main question is… if anything, what can I do about this?"
463,Is a change of plea hearing necessary for a speeding ticket?,I initially plead not guilty in writing to a speeding ticket in Ohio. Can I request a change of plea in writing and pay the fines online or will I need to schedule a change of plea hearing?
464,"Bank closed my account for (allegedly) suspected fraud, and now refuses to return my funds that were in my account","I am an American living abroad, and I had a checking account in my former home state of Ohio. I had been with this bank for more than 2 decades and have been using various services (Paypal, Wise, etc) to move money between that bank and where I am living abroad.

My aunt passed away and left me part of her ownership of a building she rented out with her brother (my uncle), to be paid out in monthly payments. This past November, my uncle sent 2 checks to my friend in Cleveland, one for $1000, the other for $4050. My friend deposited them to my checking account on my behalf, writing ""For Deposit Only"" on the back. Shortly after the checks were deposited, a week-long hold was placed on both of them, which I thought was to be expected given that previously we had been using Zelle to make my monthly payments.

But then after a week, the bank refused to lift the hold on the checks, claiming they were ""Still trying to determine the source of funds"". My uncle also sends these checks to my sister each month, and she has been depositing them with no problem at her bank, so not sure why they had trouble with my checks.

I kept using the bank's online chat service to ask for updates, but the hold remained on the checks for 3 months, saying they were still ""investigating"". Finally, last month, they informed me they were closing my account for suspected fraud and that I couldn't dispute their decision. The sent a letter to my friend just last weekend announcing that the account had been closed, and the letter said ""If there was a positive balance in the account, a check will be included with this letter."" The letter included my final statement which showed I had $5050.01 in my account, but there was no check included. I got on the bank's chat program again and asked them about the status of the check, and they said they were still investigating the funds and there was no ETA on when (or even if) they would send the check.

It's already been 6 months since my friend deposited those checks. I think that's more than enough time to ""investigate the funds"". To me, it sounds like the bank just intends to keep the money and never return it to me. Do I have any legal options to get this bank to stop stringing me along and return my money to me? I'm sick of this and just want it to be over so all involved can move on.

**EDIT 1:** Here's the redacted letter my friend received. Again, no check was included with the letter, even though they also sent me a statement showing $5050.01 in my account:

[https://i.imgur.com/uSuqKPn.png](https://i.imgur.com/uSuqKPn.png)

**EDIT 2 :** It seems like my next step is to contact the CFPB and the OCC. Hopefully this lights a fire under the bank and they just decide it's not worth the trouble dragging this out any longer. I mean, they already won. They closed my account and got rid of me as a customer. All I want is my money back and I'll be on my merry way. 

Thanks for all the advice!"

466,Merchant is filing demand for arbitration after I (consumer) win bank chargeback disputes,"Long story short, I participated in sports cards breaks on a selling platform not fully understanding how they work. These sellers on their platform are extremely persuasive and manipulative. They will get others to bid up prices on auctions and whine when they do not sell for egregious prices.

Before the sellers shipped the items that I “won” I requested a refund, do not send any items and mentioned that I would not accept any items, refuse and return them unopened.

I got no help from the sellers or the merchants support, and all they said it no returns or refunds. So I started the chargeback process with my credit card with the reason item not as described.

About 3 weeks later once I refused and returned all packages shipped to me, the tracking informed me sellers got their items and still will not refund.

Their support now sends legal team to tell me to reverse all chargebacks and pay them $xx even though chargeback amount is closer to half that amount.

The bank sides with me after I sent in all evidence to defend my case. And now the merchant filed for demand for arbitration with the  AAA.

I am not sure how to handle this besides retaining a lawyer to help defend my stance. But he is expensive. Is there anyone else that has gone through this process?"
467,Anybody know renters rights in Oklahoma?,"I have a dilemma.  I have been living in my apt going on 3 years now.  Recently the original owner sold multiple apt s to this new company from California. On March 1st or 2nd they posted a notice on our door stating that we have 60 days to vacate the apt.  I am not behind on rent, nor utilities.  They did give me the option to have them select another apt for us to move into, with the cost of moving being on them since they initiated this whole ordeal. We took them up on the offer as far as we knew they were finding us another apt. They're basically forcing tenants out with the option to sign a new lease. They will also increase rent with the new lease. Now, originally they said they were going to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom instead of a 1 bedroom for what I'm paying now plus an additional $75. Then, a week later, they called and stated that WE (not them) were mistaken and they wanted to charge us significantly more for the upgrade.  We opted for another single bedroom apt. My mother stays with me, we are both disabled and on fixed income. They know this. Last week, the woman running the show said we aren't supposed to be out until June 1st, which contradicts the notice we have which states may 1st.  She also stated that people are moving out of an apt, which they will paint and then we can move, said to start packing. Now we have tried to get in touch with this person multiple times, in person and over the phone. She's never called us back nor is she ever in the office and nobody else knows what all is going on. Although, somebody has been out to speak with my upstairs neighbors twice about the same thing, yet they've haven't stopped by ours. It's a shit show. I should've spoken with an attorney  as soon as it happened and got it in writing. I'm going to, but I'm looking for somebody to weigh in on this in the meantime."
468,Stock options rescinded,"A friend of mine was hired at a tech startup about 18 months ago as a Director of Sales. They gave him $400k on target earnings + significant shares. Last week, the company told him they’d be changing his role to individual contributor. Yesterday, they changed his OTE to $300k and took away 100,000 shares.

There is nothing in his employment agreement that speaks to whether the org is allowed to do this or not. Any idea whether this is legal?"
469,"My neighbor leaves their dog (siberian husky) outside all day every day on a tiny porch with barely any water (Atlanta, Georgia, USA)","Im so sorry this is all over the place Im just hoping yall can help me before the weather here starts getting too hot for this poor boy. 

I live in an apartment complex, and my downstairs neighbors have been keeping their husky on their very small porch, never letting the dog inside. I used to hear him move a metal bowl around or scratch at their glass door late at night but they've started putting him in a crate at night (still outside). They live on the ground floor so I've started kinda doing wellness checks on him to see if he's okay. He rarely has water (he might knock the bowl over), never food (though I've seen him eating some like jerky treats), the porch smells like pee and usually has poo on it and he's starting to look skinny. I live in Georgia where the temps hit the 100sF and I dont think any dog can survive that, let alone a husky, so im trying to do what I can before summer hits.

I could report it to my building but I have a cat that the management doesn't know about and I know I shouldn't throw stones, also if I tell them I can't help where the dog goes. I dont know if animal control would even help in this situation since it would be a first time report?

Please what are my legal options? I willing to commit crimes for this sweet boy but I wanna know what I can legally do first."
470,Should I be worried that on 2n page of notary has some blank space and my and notary sign/stamp on 3rd page (last page),"**Tacoma WA.**

**I sent a signed and notarized settlement agreement (insurance settlement) with some blank space on 2nd page and 3rd (last) page has plaintiff (my) signature notarized and notary stamp /certificate and signature? should I be worried about that blank space? there is no sign/seal of insurance company's rep. on the document.**

They sent me an agreement like that and I took it to notary - **even notary was not sure ..he said why is it blank space on page 2?** I said am not sure but than he himself said oh on each page agreement 1 agreement 2 and agreement 3 is written at the bottom corner so it should be ok.

So yes it has 3 pages but what about the space in 2nd page - can that me misused for example insurance company can put new terms and conditions in that blank space and claim that I signed like that? Also 3rd page is nothing but signature ...standalone signature page ..can that be misused ? Please note I have the original pages ..sent copies only to insurance company."
471,Florida Employer Indemnity Clause- too vague to be considered enforceable?,"I am an independent contractor working remotely for a real estate related business based in Florida. My employer wants me to sign a contract with an indemnity clause but I am hesitant to sign because the clause is so vague and appears to leave me with no recourse if my employer breaches the contract. Upon further research, it would appear that the language is so vague that it cannot be enforced. Can someone tell me what parts of this clause would or would not hold up in court or be considered enforceable? Do I need to be concerned about signing an agreement that contains this clause?

&#x200B;

""Indemnification: Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Company, its officers,

directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, and

473,Is it illegal to watch a banned film in New Zealand?,"I feel like this is an obvious question but there is a lot of conflicting information on the internet. I'm not interested in anything like child pornography which is very illegal in pretty much every country with no exception, but I was wondering if certain films that actually went to the box office which have been banned in New Zealand would fall under the same penalties? I'm a fan of twisted movies (as long as they aren't real) and was wondering if I would get into legal trouble if I viewed anything banned in New Zealand."
474,Can you receive survivors benefits social security when you're in job corps?,"I tried to ask my job corps councilor if i could still receive survivors benefits if i joined but he hasn't gotten back to me on my question yet. I've tried to find information on the internet about it but I can't. I still have courses I need to finish to complete my high school diploma, so I am still eligible for the benefits as long as I go to school, and job corps offers help to finish school. If its important, I live in Arizona.

475,Trying to get legal documents back from family home,"I’m going no contact with my family but before I do, I want to get all of my legal documentation back like my passport, birth certificate, and anything else they might have. I don’t feel safe or comfortable picking it up myself because frankly, I’m terrified of them and confrontation and I don’t feel safe or comfortable going there myself.
I texted and emailed my mom that on April 22nd, my friend will pick it up for me at the door but she didn’t respond or read anything(she has her read receipts on and she hasn’t opened any of my messages since late march of this year). I texted her sister, the homeowner, that my friend will come pick it up at the door and she said she doesn’t want them coming to pick up my stuff. I told them they can just leave it at the porch and I can grab it myself but I don’t want to talk to see any of them. I just want to pick it up and go but knowing how they are, they might try to talk to me. She just told me to stop texting her so I did. What can I do?"
476,harassment from neighbor/Options for response,"Hi. So I have a situation. Been moved into these apartments for roughly 8 months, since then I’ve had an upstairs neighbor who bangs on my ceiling loudly all throughout the day and the night/early morning with the SOLE INTENTION of making me angry. 


It’s unprovoked( or was until times I tried to confront this person ). I’ve taken multiple clear videos of the sound and it’s very loud not mistakable for anything other than multiple hard stomps or bangs, complained to the leasing office, called the Police a few times(who’ve told me repeatedly there’s nothing they could do which I find silly too lol.) andIve even got a video of her saying she’s going to keep stomping lmao. So now I’m coming to ask is there anyone I can call and report this to or what kind of options I have to remedying the situation, perhaps getting some type of money back. ANYTHING to get back at the complex for their lack of concern for the issue or neighbor for just doing it."
477,"Landlord agrees if we find tenant for him on fully funished apartment, we keep the difference on set figure. He changes agreement completely just hours before they sign. Our furnishings still remain in the contract.","We recorded the phone conversation stating ""for every x dollars over y value, we get paid monthly for one year"" to cover the value of over $8000 of items (original value of furnished items). We then deep clean entire house, rent a home depot vaccum for hundreds, post on sites over a month, host many showings (using personal days off work to do so), find tenants, connect them to him through email... he tells us 4 hours before they sign with him that the 'market is so hot and tax/ legal liability makes it so he can't add us to this contract' {generalized quote}. Thier contract includes 'fully furnished' still, we will be in the hole at least +$4000. What can we legally do in this situation? Bonus: My fiancé hasn't slept well and took off work crying herself to sleep two days knowing all the work she/we did is near useless."
478,Why can't I find representation?,"WA State: I rented a home with an ex partner. 3.5 years later I filed a protection order and was awarded the house in the permanent order. What I thought would be relief for my daughter and I was just continued abuse through the homeowner. Lots of violations regarding unannounced visits (several documented) wrongful eviction attempts, months w/out a working refrigerator and ultimately threatened with unlawful detainer if not gone within 90 days due to his intent to sell the home. I assumed he would sell to the ex but blatantly turned around and rented (cheaper) and to be sure that I'm aware had the protection order amended. Every attorney I've contacted has pushed me towards small claims or states that I need a different lawyer. I've reached out to personal injury and landlord tenant. My daughter and I have dealt with a lot over the past year and its way beyond small claims. I can't even get a return call from the local dispute resolution center...We are now out of state and lost insurance, long term primary care physicians, therapist, and ESA had to be euthanized after the move due to the stress of it all. Plus all of the security deposit is not being returned (to me anyway). There's obviously back door deals here. What can we do?"
479,Do I have a case?,"In late March I was driving home from work at 3:40am and hit a deer. I called the cops then went to my State Farm app to file a claim. I saw my app looked different than usual and decided I’d call them after I slept. Well that afternoon I called their Customer Service Number and asked them why my app looked different and they stated I hadn’t paid for the month. I made sure to ask multiple times in various wording to ensure that if I paid that I would be covered. Every time I had asked she told me yes. It went something like this:

Me: “So if I pay for now for this month, I would have coverage from the beginning of March to the end of March” 

Representative: “Yes, once you pay there won’t be any interruption in your coverage for the entire month of March”  

So I paid then asked “So if I need to file a claim for something that happened a week it won’t get rejected because I’m covered” 

She said there shouldn’t be any issues if I were to file claim for anything that happened in March. 

So I filed a claim and it was rejected because I wasn’t covered. I called the claims office and they told me a few things: my policy doesn’t exist and that I need to contact my agent. I contacted my agent and they said they’d investigate. The next day the agent called and told me they had a meeting that morning to ensure this misinformation wasn’t spread and that they weren’t going to do anything to help me. I asked them “so you basically lied to me and aren’t going to help me?” They said basically yea, sorry about that. 

I need to know if I have a chance if I wanted to sue, because what the fuck."
480,Using well-known photos in my blog posts,"Hello everyone!

I'm preparing to launch a new website about photography, where I will discuss different photography techniques as well as the works of famous photographers. 

My question is, will I be able to use well-known photos from famous photographers in my articles? I've read somewhere that something like this is allowed if an article serves as a critique of a specific photo. Is that true? 

And also, could I use a photo if an article isn't specifically about it, but is closely related to the message a photo tries to convey?

Example: I want to talk about using lines in photography, and I'd like to include [Rhein II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein_II) in the article as an example.

I'd really appreciate it if somebody could clarify this whole copyright situation for me.

Thanks!

Cheers"
481,Brother cut me out of our Grandmother’s will!,"My Grandma passed away 9 months ago. My brother and I and each to receive 40% each of her savings and the last 20% to her caretaker.  She was not rich but did have several hundred thousand dollars saved. He told me that the will will have to go through probate.  That was 7 months ago. When I text him, he won’t even mention the money. Meanwhile, he is suddenly driving a brand new BMW.  He was the executor for my grandmother’s will and also had access to her accounts to pay her bills while she was alive. Is it typical for probate to take this long or am I getting ripped off by my own brother?"
482,I want to send a cease and desist order,"An Ex-Friend of mine has upwards of 300K on tiktok. 
We had a falling out TWO YEARS ago, and TO THIS DAY they still post about me. 
I let them slide for the majority of it, I really tried to be cordial, but they have been slamming me ever since, to the point where their followers regularly send me death threats and I have had to ask them to take down videos that directly name me. 
They have posted private information of mine (regarding my mental health problems), constantly bashed my character, made up straight lies about me, and then today they have the gall to post a 3 year old video of the two of us acting like everything is fine solely for the views. 
I’m sick of it. I want a cease and desist order from a lawyer because they won’t listen any other way. 
How would I go about this and what would be the cheapest route? Is this even grounds for a cease and desist order?

484,Breach of Privacy: I logged into my ex’s Facebook and took screenshots of messages (nothing sexual),"My fiancé (21F) and I (21M) recently broke up. She cheated on me and I found out it has been going on for months prior to our breakup. I am deployed to Iraq currently. I could not control my emotions or my actions and I started calling her parents and her friends in search of answers as to if she has cheated in the past as well. I found a password that she left in my Google account and I used the password to log into her Facebook and I went through countless conversations and I found messages between her and someone she claimed she doesn’t know. He tried sleeping with her, she turned him down from what I saw but there was a text message that she sent saying “ngl when you hmu I thought about getting with you” The conversation then continued to Snapchat which I don’t have access to. There was also a conversation with her ex which I found while I was in AIT in 2021 about her asking him to come over and when I asked her about it she logged me out and deleted the conversation and after she deleted she sent him a message saying “aye i'm gonna delete you off fb n snap n shit, anthony is being suspicious about us hanging out and shit. him and i are tryna get straight w eachother so it's probably best for us to just not hang out anymore, i don't want to ruin my marriage for this shit yk. sorry man” I just can’t help myself to stop looking for answers I don’t want to find. She knows I’ve been through her Facebook and she and her new boyfriend are threatening to press charges against me for Breach of Privacy and Harassment. I promised to leave her alone but she still owes me money for the bills that I’m still paying for. The electricity, internet, phone. I want to cancel them all right now because I fear she won’t pay me for them like she said she would but I’m scared that if I do she will press charges against me. I haven’t made any death threats towards her but I did expose the screenshots on Facebook since which I have deleted them. How deep of a grave have I dug myself?"
485,Roommate is vandalizing my property. He pays our utilities and charges me.

He has taken retaliatory action and began to intentionally damage my property. He has been in charge of paying out utility bills in the past and requests me payment via venmo.

486,Speeding ticket dilemma,"I turned into a Main Street from a side road. A speed limit sign was posted before the intersection at which I merged into Main Street. Officer gave me a ticket even though I told him I didn’t know and could not possibly know there is a speed limit sign because it’s posted before I turn into Main Street. 
How can I fight it? 
Let say I’m in SC. 
Is there a code or regulation which states that driver can’t be held responsible for traffic sign if it’s not visible to a driver? 

Additionally, at what point speed limit sign becomes invalid? When it reaches next speed limit sign and/or intersection and/or after certain distance? 

EDIT: I’d categorize the area as urban. IIRC Default is 30 but speed limit was posted 25 at the beginning of the road. I was maintaining about 30 but going down hill got me to 35."

488,Friends want a % of my business,"This is in Oregon.

Three years ago I started a small, homeschool nature group. Out of my own pocket- as a resource for the community.
Last year I earned a $10,000 micro grant from an alternative education fund to grow my group.

I fulfill the grant and grow my business reach successfully. I then apply for the Next Step grant through the same company.

My two friends came to sit with me while I brainstormed to write up the grant. Friend A suggested that I create an adventure website. I liked the idea, and I said “sounds great! We can go in on it as equal partners!” Or something along those lines.

I wrote up the grant and earned the $50,000 next step grant! My friends now want a 1/3 share of my business. I feel that although I made some verbal promises, nothing was in writing. I also do not know much about business. Now that I realize everything that goes into business including taxes and liability.

Throughout all these negotiations my friends have been rather nasty. I no longer want to honor when the 40/30/30 split I had offered. When I look at it- my work created this opportunity.

They view my grant as “free” money and our money. Some of this is my fault- I didn’t think how making them equal partners would mean a loss for me since they are bringing no money to the table- just offering to do work like write unit studies, design for my content, and scout trails.

They hired a lawyer and want to meet to create a contract. What is fair in this situation?

I own the LLC- I am the sole proprietor. I met them through the group I created (they were customers). I am not sure how to navigate this in a way that I don’t lose control over what I created. I also do want to be fair to my friends.

I offered 40/30/30 on the website (but I assume tax liabilities). They didn’t like this because they aren’t on the LLC. I now feel like this offer over text was too generous and maybe these friends are not the friends I thought they were.

Can I legally backtrack? What is typical or fair share in a situation like this?"

491,First time speeding ticket in CA,"Hi, 

TLDR; cop was being “nice” and I’m wondering if he can make it worse if I try to get it thrown out all together

Today I got a speeding ticket late at night on a highway in Los Angeles. Post speed limit is 65 and speed of traffic was around 80 as usual. I was clocked a little over 90. The cop wrote the ticket for 80. I’m wondering if I should just ask for traffic school and call it a day or  should I attempt to please not guilty first. If I plead not guilty and the cop does show up, can he adjust the ticket to the clocked rate? Do they even have records of speedometer/ dash cam? 


For those who are going to just say “slow down” or something like that, I was trying to get away from a person in a SUV 10x the cost of mine brake checking me… I drive a hybrid, it starts crying at 80…"

Few procedures didn’t work which can happen sometimes and need to be redone, and the employer wants to get some of my salary back.

496,I found mold in my apartment. Can I be compensated?,"So a few weeks ago I discovered a large portion of my bedroom carpet was covered in mold. All my things that were stored under the bed were damp or covered in spores. It was disgusting. After putting in a maintenance request, we found out our shower was leaking water through the wall and into my bedroom. The shower hadn’t been properly sealed before we moved in. I had to move out all my stuff, and my roommate and I slept in the living room for several days while they tore up the carpets and the wall to air out the mold. Mind you, this was during finals week, so I was very stressed trying to study for exams. They sealed the shower and we didn’t have to pay for any repairs. But I had to throw out a lot of my belongings, including a suitcase, bath towels, some clothes, 2 brittas, an electric toothbrush, and bedsheets. First, I’m wondering if we can have next month’s rent partially reduced because we were technically displaced from our room during that time. Second, I would like for the landlord to pay for all the stuff that got covered in mold. I didn’t take pictures of everything because my first instinct was to throw it away because of the smell. Do I contact the landlord directly?

edit: I live in California btw"
497,Probate?,"I just need to know what to do. We live in Kansas.

My husband's best friend in recent months had tremors and was not well..

A medical facility had him taking an experimental drug for tremors in a blind study. He had been in the study for about two months.

Yesterday he called and asked for a ride to the Emergency Room as he was having trouble breathing. We got there about 2:00 p.m. He was released and sent home about 12:30 a.m. this morning.

He was not answering his phone or the doorbell, so my husband went over, as he has the alarm code and could get in. My husband found him passed away in the bathroom and called 911. The EMT said he had been dead several hours. The police and medical examiner just left, and they plan to do an autopy because of the study. We contacted his brother and together we chose a funeral home.

Months ago, he told us he had a will and my husband is named executor. I think we need to do something legal with the will. 

Does anyone know what steps we need to take from here? Please? Thanks."
