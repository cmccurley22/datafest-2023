0,"Seller didn't disclose termites, Inspector negligently missed them... do we have any recourse? [NJ]","We are new homeowners, and dealing with a nightmare lemon-house (purchased from out of state)... please help me figure out if we have any recourse with this particular issue. If not, this may financially ruin us.

* Seller indicated ""no"" on disclosure form to history of termites, and ""no"" to a history of contracts with pest control companies for termites. We hired an inspector (who offered an add-on termite inspection), and he didn't note anything wrong with the property. There is an active infestation in the foundation and  throughout the house. 3 separate opinions noted any competent inspector should have seen the issues. (I didn't know what to look for during final walkthrough, never grew up where termites were widespread).
* I called a few local termite treatment companies. One of the big companies said that they have an account at our address, under the seller's name. There are also a few knocked-down mud tubes on the property. We were told this is a standard procedure after treatment (so you can tell if they return). It looks like the Seller failed to disclose termites (or at least, having had a contract with the company, which was on the disclosure form).

Could the seller liable for some of the repairs we will need? (it is extensive unfortunately). Our contract did say something about advising buyers hire a professional exterminator to inspect for termites prior to closing (we unfortunately trusted our inspector as competent). Does that advise disqualify the seller from liability?  


We are in NJ"
1,"[CA] My company is forcing me to download an app that allows them to monitor my calls, texts, photos, location, apps, and internet usage of our personal phones, I was explained that they have the right to look if they need to.","In CA, The company I work for is forcing employees to download and app that monitors all phone usage. This includes text, social media, location, calls, photos, internet history and what apps we use. This is not on a company phone but our own personal phone. 

On top of this we are not only being monitored during our shift but were told that the app will continue monitoring while we are not at work. This seems like it is violating ethic codes. What are my options?"
2,NEED HELP!! Contractor refuses to continue work and has taken materials ordered for our project,"We hired a contractor to build a gable patio for us in the backyard. The contractor had originally quoted us 4 weeks to finish this project. We have a contract, which outlines a payment schedule by time. Such as week 1 an X amount will be paid, Week 2 X amount will be paid (I know this was our mistake, we should have done by the work done instead) . The first week things were slow, demolition took way longer then it should have. The contractor assured us that thing will pick up. Second was the same as well, yet we adhered to the payment schedule.  By the end of week 3, ~ 70% of the work was done. But the rest still remained. But there was no change as week 4 concluded, and he asked for money so we told him we won't be releasing any money as there no progress from the previous week. After a long and heated discussion we ended up give him the check. At this point,  we have given 92% of the amount agreeed upon by bother parties and the last 8% was to be delieved upon finishing the project. The week later he came back and asked for more money. We refused as its not in the contract we signed. And he came back with change orders, (changes that we supposedly made to the scope of work). Most of the items were already in the scope of work disscussed and signed by him and I. So we refused them as well. He then took the marterial for our project  and refuses to give it back. The dudes an 80 year old man, who is kinda racist ( we are immigrants).  I just want to know what I can do. He refuses to meet, our original idea was to have him sign an agreement where we release the remaining 8% of the money in parts after certain things of the project are completed. To the best of our knowledge, we have not breached the contract. Would love some help in this manner. He keeps threatening liens on us if we don't pay. We live in Texas btw."
3,Scammed in Philippines,"Admittedly, i fucked up this time. Last night I matched with a girl on tinder, and we agreed to meet. I did ask if she was a prostitute, or charged in anyway, and she said no. we went to her hotel room, and mid way her friend walked in, and she joined in without saying more than hey whats up. After the deed was done they then demanded 60,000 philippino pesos, saying their friend was a hooker. Of course I only had 3000, so they walked me to an ATM, where 4 of their friends joined and made sure I didn't try anything.
They even threatened to call the police on ME.
I know, I'm an idiot, but I want to know, what should I do now, what should I have done, and cani actually get in trouble here? PS yes I'm an American traveling abroad.

Tldr:got scammed big time by hooker I thought was into me"
4,"160k in debt, no promised license yet, can I sue?","I graduated last year from a nonprofit private university with $160,000 of private loan debt for a music teaching degree. Please don't comment on the poor reasoning here- it's beside the point and I’ve learned my lesson. This degree promised to equip me with all the requirements to obtain a teaching license. After graduating, the school reached out with the following:

""Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that the instructor who taught you the required reading standards did not meet the new faculty qualifications under a recent state rule that was passed. Because of this, we now need you to complete an additional course with a qualified reading instructor before we can submit your license materials to the proper licensure association."" They covered the course for me. 

I completed the class and still haven't gotten my license yet this year as the teacher still hasn't put in final grades for the course (and the course was a total joke, it took me roughly two hours to complete (all online) and the professor took 2+ months respond to any request). Obviously, I was declined from all teaching jobs I applied to during this time while I didn't have a license. I've taken a job in a childcare, just trying to make ends meet right now. This put my career on hold for a whole year, and I can’t get my deposit back from the licensing organization when I went to try and apply the first time back in July. Can I press charges against my university? Any other advice for what to do is appreciated."
5,Excessive Force?,I was arrested at my residence for traffic ticket warrants and while being escorted out of my home in handcufs my dog lunged at the officer thinking I was in danger. My dog did not bite the officer but came very close to he then told me “you better get your dog before I shoot it” I then replied “your not gonna shoot my dog your in her yard”. I then yelled at my dog to get away wich she did the officer then jerked me to continue walking toward the end of the driveway. He then jerked me again at which point I told him “chill out” and before I new it he legged swept me from the front causing me to land straight on my head. Being that i was handcuffed i could not brace my fall and ended up being knocked unconscious from the fall. My question is  Can i sue the police officer for excessive force or would his actions be justified under law? my security cameras captured the whole encounter.
6,I bought a pickup and never changed the title into my name,So I bought my pickup about 3.5 years ago and when the old owners sold it to me they signed the release of liability and gave me the title and release of liability. I put it in a file somewhere and lost it for a couple years I couldn’t remember where I put it and looked “everywhere” for it. I just recently moved from california to kansas and in the move I finally found it. How should I go about getting it transferred into my name now that I  finally have it?
7,My friend has a court summons in Brantley County in Georgia,"So long story short, the summons is over a reckless driving charge. She lives in FL (4 hours away from the court she’s summoned to go to) and is low on money and can’t afford the trip. Is anyone famously with this court and would know if she can schedule a zoom hearing? The court is Brantley County Probate."
8,"Terminating lease due to no hot water for almost 6 months. What are my rights, how do I go about ending my contract?","So middle of October 2022 I did not have hot water. A work order was submitted to the property and after I followed up they said the plumber was working on it. Fast forward to today, April 2023. I still do not have hot water. The property is well aware of the hot water issues and there are tons of other tenants who have left reviews on their website complaining, even the news interviewed a previous tenant regarding the hot water issues. I am at a point where I need to get out of this lease, I cannot take it anymore. They closed my last work order (cancelled it ) regarding the hot water without following up with me to see if I had hot water. No plumber has been by my apartment since January to check. I have the option to “buy out” of my lease…but given the fact they aren’t holding up their end of the contract, I would like to end the contract without legal repercussions or paying the buy out fees. Is this something I legally have a right to do at this point? I am located in Oklahoma, which of course has almost 0 laws to protect tenants. But, hot water is a basic necessity so I need to know if I have a standing chance to get out of my lease legally."
9,Can I garnish the bank account of my husband (who is spending literally HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS on his mistress) for nonpayment of temporary alimony?,"The trial is almost a year away. He was court-ordered to pay alimony pendente lite, and he just stopped paying (purely out of anger), giving no notice to me or his lawyers. His noncompliance is EXTREME. He has already been held in contempt twice over other matters, and there are additional contempt motions pending.  He is not at all dissuaded by contempt motions. He is self-employed, so I can’t garnish his wages. He was also court-ordered to cover our expensive health insurance premium, and he stopped paying that as well. I am chronically ill and need medication that costs tens of thousands per month without insurance.  "
10,My company my son works for can’t pay them this week. Is this common?,"My son started this manufacturing company in January. Everything was going great. Unlimited overtime and lots of opportunities to hone his skill as a machinist. He loves it there. Well just yesterday the company had a meeting where they laid off 6 employees and told the remaining 15 that they wouldn’t be getting paid this week because they had no money to cover payroll. That they’d all have to wait ‘til next week. The company is in California. What can be done legally? And if this is a recurring thing?


Updated Title. “The” company my son works for... (I’m cringing)"
11,How to keep the fact that I was the victim in a child sexual abuse case private when I have to include it on my bar application?,"The state is MA, if that helps.

The C&F question is ""*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*""

I was a victim-witness in a child sexual abuse case and I also sued my abuser after the criminal case concluded.

I don't want this to become public record. I don't want the entire board of bar examiners knowing this sensitive information about me if it's avoidable. And I certainly I don't wish for the bar examiners to contact me or anyone in my family to ask questions about it.

It has zero bearing on my ability to practice law. It seems crazy that I have to include legal actions in which I was not the party who caused the harm.

I was *three years old* when the harm began (or at least when it was first independently verifiable--most likely began earlier than that.) It seems crazy that anything that happened that long ago should have to be included on my bar application. What's next? Do I have to include my kindergarten disciplinary record?

Is there anything I can do to keep this private, totally irrelevant information private?

And how many documents do they expect me to dig up for this? Finding documents (perhaps having to request documents from a court in another state) from the cases is going to cause more emotional distress than I want to be dealing with during exam. Is there any way to avoid this? I hate this."
12,TX - Update on gamestop giving my PS5 to a thief.,"I called the corporate line like most of you suggested. Thanks for that. Also F you for that. Holy hell that line was the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. Including comcast. 

Anyways. After being transferred from India to China to Taiwan and then to Malaysia. Or just 3 different departments whom had no clue what the hell was going on. Seriously… Warm transfers anyone? I finally got on the phone with someone who mattered. I had to send the video from my phone to them, but they finally agreed that the store screwed up. They gave me a replacement right away.  They asked if the same store was a good place to pick up the unit, I said yes and they gave me some instructions for the supervisor there. 

Get to the store and new employees are there. Manager I talked with had been hired yesterday so apparently this was bad enough for the previous people to be gone. Either that or they just hired a new manager. He had to make 3 phone calls to get the transaction processed. Its like they hired a kid off the street and didn’t train them. Either way doesn’t matter to me. Ill never be back to gamestop ever.  

I get the unit home and noticed it was the disk version. At that point I no longer cared that it was an upgrade. I was done and never wanted to go through this process again. I just spent the day transferring his ps4 games to his ps5. 

Side note. The guy who stole the ps5 got caught. The manager realized the situation halfway through and told me they caught the guy. Said he did it to several gamestops and got caught in the act at one of them."
13,Employer not allowing me to park in the patient lot handicapped parking. Forcing me to park in a far away employee lot on other side of hospital.,"I am a young, healthy looking employee with a handicap placard. I have an artificial hip and a metal rod holding my femur together- but I don't walk with a limp. However walking long distances often results in  me being unable to fall asleep as pain seems to creep up on me in the evening.

My employer (a hospital) is requiring all employees to park in a certain lot, which happens to be on the other side of the hospital from my office. 

I started parking in a patient lot as there are numerous handicapped parking spots there, and they are never fully filled. A parking attendant saw me park, recognized me and chastised me for parking in a handicapped spot. After I told her I had a placard, she still told me I am not allow to be in this lot.

I don't know if I should press the issue, any insights or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe Im the asshole."
14,I requested an exterminator for a mouse outbreak. Eleven days later and no exterminator has come and my landlord has sent notice that my apartment has unsanitary living conditions.,"I am a current student at university and have lived in my apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the past year and a half. Last week, I was doing work in my living space when a mouse crawled under my door and run into my kitchen. I put in a maintenance request that day requesting an exterminator. I am deeply afraid of mice and have been avoiding my kitchen at all cost because that is where the mouse tends to live. 

A maintenance man showed up the next day asking where the dead mouse was and I stated that I needed someone to remove the mouse living in my kitchen. He looked around and told me that the exterminator only comes to the building one day a week and that he had just come the day prior so I had to wait a week for the exterminator. 

In the mean time, I purchased a few hundred dollars worth of mice removal equipment and pet control items for my apartment. I waited a week for the exterminator to come on the day that the maintenance man said the exterminator would come but they no showed. Due to my university schedule, I was home until 3:00pm when I left my only class of the day (which started at 3:30) began.

The next day, I called my apartment complex  when I saw the mouse again and explained that the mouse was still there. I explained that the exterminator never showed like was promised and they said they would send someone my way. 

I was breaking down large boxes when a maintenance man showed up at my door. I had left my boxes next to my sofa and the trash bags, full of items the mouse got into the night prior that I had just finished cleaning up, along the wall next to the boxes.  The maintenance man asked where the dead mouse was again and I told him that the mouse was still alive hiding in my kitchen. He asked to come in and I let him in again. He looked at my boxes and said that those were good hiding spots for mice to hide in and I told him that I was just breaking them down when he arrived. 

He then entered the kitchen (which I have refused to enter for the past week) to see if there were any holes in the walls that the mouse was using as a hiding spot. I explained to him that the mouse had crawled threw my front door to enter my apartment so he left to get something to prevent the mouse from entering my apartment that way in the future. He told me he would only be gone a couple of minutes but ended up being gone for 40 minutes. By the time he has come back, I needed to get to class so I left him in my apartment to do whatever he needed to do.

Later in the day, I get an email stating that due to ""undisposed garbage, boxes along the floor, and moldy food left in the kitchen sink and oven"" I was going to be expecting a surprise visit from my landlord to inspect the property. I went into my kitchen and did see dishes in my sink I needed to wash but there was no mold on any plates nor was there any food or mold in my oven.

I have since cleaned up the boxes and trash bags but what can I do to get them to send an exterminator? Could this be something they can evict me for?"
15,My mentally impaired cousin is being abused by her husband.,"i’m not sure what my cousin has, but she is deaf.. hardly speaks and mentally she’s 5. she had a planned married back in 2011, and had her daughter in 2016. my cousin was under my aunt’s care up until 2017, when she moved out with her husband and kid. since then, the 3 of them live in a very cluttered and filthy room that they rent out. 

i recently saw their daughter for the first time since she was a kid.. she just turned 9 yesterday. she tells me that her dad hits her mom, and how he always comes home drunk. she tells me she has to pretend to love her dad or else “bad things will happen”. she tells me she remembers bad things from her childhood.. and when i ask her what memories she has, she says she doesn’t remember. she tells me her family fat shames her. she tells me she can’t communicate with her parents. 

to put it in perspective, her father is an alcoholic that came from vietnam so he doesn’t speak any english. her mom, is mentally not there so she can’t communicate. her father also takes her mom’s disability checks for himself.

she’s told me that her mom tried to commit suicide from the abuse from her dad. i’ve grown up with her mom and it doesn’t sit right with me that my cousin would ever have the mental capacity to try to harm herself like that. idk. she’s using so many curse words at such a young age and tells me “my parents don’t understand what im saying so..” and then tells me that she had to go to summer school but since her parents don’t know english she didn’t go. 

do i call aps? cps? what do i do? i want to save them so bad."
16,Anything I can do of a guy not wanting to delete my nudes and sharing them on discord servers?,As the title says. I’m norwegian. He is American. I was once young and dumb. It’s been three years and I thought he had them deleted. Turns out he doesn’t. He’s been posting my nudes in discord servers. Idk what to do.
17,Friend created a website telling people not to use a business; owner threatening to sue,"A couple of years ago my friend hired a cleaning company to clean his house.  They charged him for 17 hours of work and stuck him with almost a $2000 bill.  My friend was appalled at the condition of the house and couldn’t believe how bad of a job they did.  He had primarily hired them to clean up the dog hair from a previous owner and there was still dog hair everywhere.  My friend took pictures of huge clumps of dog hair to document this.

My friend demanded a refund because he could not understand what the 17 hours was spent doing when the house did not look like it had been cleaned at all.  Several Google reviews online from other dissatisfied customers backed up this claim and shared similar stories about astronomically high bills with little results.

My friend created a website called “donothire(business name here)” and documented his experience with them with pictures, urging people not to use their services.  Over the year the comments section received several people commending him for calling attention to this business, once again citing similar stories.

The owner is now threatening to sue and - at the very least - threatening a restraining order.  Before this threat my friend took the site down.

I’m curious: how boned is he?"
18,"Friends horse was stolen, officer said they can't get her back","So, my friend has a horse who they've had for over 10 years. She's had a bad injury that prevented them from riding her. They kept her as healthy/comfortable as humanely possible and even had a surgery done years ago to minimize any pain the horse might be feeling.

A month ago they noticed the horse was in way too much pain and felt it was ethical to euthanize her. It was an extremely painful decision, this horse has been a huge part of their life. 

Right before the veterinarian came, a woman stole the horse from the property they were keeping her and contacted them saying the horse was fine. This woman claims the horse is completely healthy and wouldn't acknowledge the pain she is in. She basically told them that *she* will let them know when *she* feels like it's time to euthanize and let them know so they can say goodbye.

My friends contacted the authorities of course, but they said since the horse is on private property, they can't do anything about it. That can't be right! I don't know exactly what kind of documentation of ownership they have, but I know there's years of veterinary records with the horses photo attached, shipping records, etc. 

They think the horse might've been harmed further by being moved to a new property. I think my friend feels dumb trying to lawyer up to get a horse back just to put her down, but this has been painful enough before she was stolen. They wanted to make a humane choice and had veterinarian consent to do so. It's like their choice to say goodbye has been taken from them and it's horrible. 

Is there anything that can be done for this situation?

Edit - thank you everyone for the kind and helpful answers ❤️ I'm crying, it's not even my horse but it's sucked watching my friend go through this and feel like there's nothing they can do about it."
19,Neighbor keeps harassing us and now put these out.,"Hi!

I recently relocated to Rochester Minnesota in December for my wifes job. We bought our home and we love everything except our neighbors.

Ever since we have moved in they have constantly harassed us about their fence citing that we were ""piling up snow"" on it. Regardless of the fact that I told them that snow comes from the sky, not from our garage and reminded them about the middle school concept of snow drift/erosion. They have on one occasion even dumped all the snow that was between our fence and driveway onto my driveway and then left. Anytime we do something they have any semblance of an issue with they scream, cuss and as a result of their geriatric mouths with barely any teeth, spit on us in the process. I had planned to just keep ignoring it even though I know they keep coming onto our property to stare at their beloved fence that is approximately a foot away from our driveway/garage, but that's creepy.

Now here was the last straw for me. They posted these stupid signs at two points facing our driveway and at this point I feel like it's almost proof of them harassing me and definitely proof that they keep walking onto my property without permission, and I've flnally just reached my breaking point. Does anyone have any idea what I could do? I called our non emergency line and the cops basically said that the only thing we can do is get a restraining order or trespass them from our property. They also have decorated the front fence with one of those ""protected by the 2nd ammendment"" stickers that faces me every time I enter my driveway. I'm at a loss and was wondering if I could get any advice.

Lastly, yes the fence is behind their property lines, so I can't cite them for that.

Since I can't post an image, the sign is massive, red and reads 

""Absolutely no snow! No trespassing, no garbage, no yard debris, animals, mice or snakes. 

Any damage to property/fence is on you""

Thanks for your time."
20,Can my ex hide all our assets under an LLP so I don’t get half in our divorce?,"I am going through a divorce with my ex, we have two children, a mortgage, two car loans, and a good amount of stuff. As of this writing I have filled divorce but we’re still officially married. We’re in Texas.


Last fall, while we were married, he formed three companies: a LLP which owns a for-profit LLC which owns a non-profit LLC. According to the business structure, he and I each have a 1% stake in the LLP, and each of the LLCs own 49% stake in the LLP. My ex owns 100% of the for-profit LLC, which owns 100% of the non-profit LLC. There was no official legal counsel consulted for the formation of these companies; he got a Partnership Agreement template for the LLC from a LegalZoom equivalent. I do have a copy of that I can consult if questions arise.


He basically is trying to turn our “estate” into a business. He says the LLP owns our house and all our assets and liabilities. *He* and *I* don’t actually own anything, it’s all considered a depreciable asset of the LLP. According to his 2022 Annual Report, each of the 3 companies are considered a “Real Estate Investment Trust” and none of them have any tax due. He hasn’t done any business with the for-profit or non-profit LLCs, no clients, $0 in the business bank accounts.


If you check the public records for our home, only his and my names are on the deed of our house, not any of the companies.


He did a complete estate asset valuation table that included almost every item in our home that we own. I’ll mention, last spring we sold our first house and got a pretty hefty cash profit, about $80k of which went into a down payment and upgrades on our current house. The remaining $80k he pretty much unilaterally spent on STUFF. I wanted to invest, I tried to save, but he spent it, and more, putting us further in credit card debt. Our couples therapist heavily suspected Narcissistic Personality Disorder, that coupled with lots of other stuff led to me filing for divorce.


It was my understanding that in the divorce, I am entitled to half our community property, or realistically half the fair market value of our community property. Especially since he spent all our cash, we can’t afford our mortgage, car payments, and preschool tuition without his mom’s help, so all we really have is *stuff*.


I wrote up a proposal because we’re trying to settle out of court. I do have legal representation (I’m going to confer with him about this of course, but I want to be armed with all the info I can), but my ex is representing himself. We agree on custody entirely (50/50), and he didn’t seem to have an issue with the standard child support calculator. We mutually want a good-faith, inexpensive, efficient, out-of-court settlement.


Upon reading my proposal, he said I have NO claim to half the value of our assets because they’re owned by the LLP. I don’t think he has an issue physically giving me some stuff, but he doesn’t think he owes me half the fair market value of the community property he’s keeping. Is that legit? Everything I’ve read about hiding assets from divorce in LLCs is referencing LLCs formed PRIOR to marriage, where the assets wouldn’t be community property. He says I’m entitled to half the equity of our LLP, which is all our assets minus all our liabilities, which conveniently equals zero according to his valuations. 


I’m well over my head here, and trying not to be the victim of his mental/emotional/financial abuse anymore. If anyone has read this far and has input, I am so grateful."
21,"My son has started refusing to come over for visitation, and my ex is not following any of the court orders. What can i do?","I have an order of joint custody (im non-custodial) and a standard visitation order following oklahoma law. My son who is 7 has started refusing to come over and giving every excuse imaginable from ""i dont play with him"" to ""i ignore him"" which isn't true but his mother refuses to listen. Whenever asked to be more encouraging instead of simply saying ""you dont have to go if you dont want to"" she just replies that shes not forcing her autistic son to do something he doesnt want to. This also isnt the first time this has happened. After looking at it further she hasnt followed a single one of the courts orders, she always makes plans on my weekends with him and in the 4 years since the court order hes stayed the night a total of 4 times. I had to have myself added to his medical records by contacting the hospital and giving them the court order, and had to do the same for his old school. I dont even know what school he is in now and i certainly havnt been added to his contact list. 

&#x200B;

So are there any options or steps i can take before finding a lawyer and making it a full blown court battle? Ive tried contacting DHS already but they told me they dont handle that kind of issue."
22,Billed for No Services Rendered,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, not sure exactly where it belongs.  This is in PA.

In 2018 my husband and I purchased a LG washer and drier.  The salesman convinced us to purchase a warranty which we later realized was money wasted.  The warranty was from Consumer Protection Services (CPS).

In January the washer dies and we are in dire straights because we have a newborn and are using it for multiple loads daily.  We submit a claim using the CPS website.  The claim is accepted and a company called LG Electronics Alabama, Inc is assigned the repair with a date scheduled.  In the meantime we are frantically searching for a place that can repair it sooner. 

We find another repair place and the washer gets fixed.  LG Electronics Alabama, Inc gets in contact with my husband for the appointment and he cancels it (he has all the texts saved).  I checked the CPS website and couldn't find a way to officially cancel the claim online so I just left it open.  Probably should have called to talk to someone but had other newborn stuff to do.

Fast forward to yesterday and we receive a bill in the mail for $268 for ""Service call not covered under warranty”.  Bill dated 4-11.  Of course we call and can't get through so I send an email to the address listed on the bill explaining the situation and asking for proof of services rendered.

If the appointment was cancelled and no services were provided I can't just be billed, right?  I am hoping this is just a mistake, but if CPS pushes back, what are my best options?  I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a fighting a ding on my credit for not paying a fabricated bill."
23,"Bank closed my account for (allegedly) suspected fraud, and now refuses to return my funds that were in my account","I am an American living abroad, and I had a checking account in my former home state of Ohio. I had been with this bank for more than 2 decades and have been using various services (Paypal, Wise, etc) to move money between that bank and where I am living abroad.

My aunt passed away and left me part of her ownership of a building she rented out with her brother (my uncle), to be paid out in monthly payments. This past November, my uncle sent 2 checks to my friend in Cleveland, one for $1000, the other for $4050. My friend deposited them to my checking account on my behalf, writing ""For Deposit Only"" on the back. Shortly after the checks were deposited, a week-long hold was placed on both of them, which I thought was to be expected given that previously we had been using Zelle to make my monthly payments.

But then after a week, the bank refused to lift the hold on the checks, claiming they were ""Still trying to determine the source of funds"". My uncle also sends these checks to my sister each month, and she has been depositing them with no problem at her bank, so not sure why they had trouble with my checks.

I kept using the bank's online chat service to ask for updates, but the hold remained on the checks for 3 months, saying they were still ""investigating"". Finally, last month, they informed me they were closing my account for suspected fraud and that I couldn't dispute their decision. The sent a letter to my friend just last weekend announcing that the account had been closed, and the letter said ""If there was a positive balance in the account, a check will be included with this letter."" The letter included my final statement which showed I had $5050.01 in my account, but there was no check included. I got on the bank's chat program again and asked them about the status of the check, and they said they were still investigating the funds and there was no ETA on when (or even if) they would send the check.

It's already been 6 months since my friend deposited those checks. I think that's more than enough time to ""investigate the funds"". To me, it sounds like the bank just intends to keep the money and never return it to me. Do I have any legal options to get this bank to stop stringing me along and return my money to me? I'm sick of this and just want it to be over so all involved can move on.

**EDIT 1:** Here's the redacted letter my friend received. Again, no check was included with the letter, even though they also sent me a statement showing $5050.01 in my account:

**EDIT 2 :** It seems like my next step is to contact the CFPB and the OCC. Hopefully this lights a fire under the bank and they just decide it's not worth the trouble dragging this out any longer. I mean, they already won. They closed my account and got rid of me as a customer. All I want is my money back and I'll be on my merry way. 

Thanks for all the advice!"
24,Apartment won’t give my application deposit back,"My boyfriend and I applied for an apartment last November with a $750 application fee/holding deposit and were denied after waiting a whole month to hear back (we were fresh out of grad school and couldn’t provide pay stubs, we toured the place and they said offer letters from our jobs would be okay then went back on their word, but that’s beside the point). We were told we would get the deposit back within 4-6 weeks. 

We were about to start the process of moving out of the apartment we stayed in during grad school, and each of us went to our parents’ homes for the holidays. When we were rejected, I spoke with someone on the phone AND sent an email asking them to send our check to my parents’ address instead, knowing it would take forever. I have an email from them confirming they had received my email and would request the check be sent there. 

Well we never got the check back and obviously ended up moving into a different apartment building in the same area. I went in person back in January and was told they had sent the check to the old address, our graduate school apartment, despite their email confirmation that it would be sent to my parents’ address! They said they would cancel the original check and issue a new one, to expect it in 3-4 weeks. It’s been 3 months and nothing. We’ve tried calling, they never answer. Emailing, they never get back to us. Our work hours don’t align with their hours, so now that we’ve started our jobs it’s impossible to go in person. What are our options and what are the laws about this? We’re in New York if that matters."
