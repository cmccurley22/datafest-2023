She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I’d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn’t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn’t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that’s how she keeps track of him.\n\nI told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I’d give him the phone.\n\nHe instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he’d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.\n\nLeft and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)\n\nI had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.\n\nI had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won’t always work out like this.\n\nI also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I’ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) \n\nHe again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he’d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I’d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.\n\nI hope I’ve done the right thing and didn’t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn’t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.\n\nThanks for your input everyone.

I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash.

A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.\n\nThe officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.\n\nAfter they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later.

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \n\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \n\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… \n\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \n\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \n\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\n\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. \n\nI had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. \n\nThe next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. \n\nThen today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. \n\nI am sick and tired of it and want him punished. \n\nThis has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  \n\nIs there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. \n', 'author_fullname': 't2_2dox0ssy', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 3, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things.

I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None,

At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.\n\nHe called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.\n\nWe went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. \n\nThere were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. \n\nI should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.\n\nI hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore.

At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn&amp;#39;t because I told him I&amp;#39;d run away and call the police if he did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they&amp;#39;d already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn&amp;#39;t make me feel ashamed at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we&amp;#39;re illegal. She wasn&amp;#39;t there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don&amp;#39;t know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that&amp;#39;s what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they&amp;#39;re gonna look into it though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we&amp;#39;d stay for now. Like a shelter or something. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should of done this year&amp;#39;s ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s happening or gonna happen but the place I&amp;#39;m in now is way cleaner than I&amp;#39;m used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don&amp;#39;t have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren&amp;#39;t happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can&amp;#39;t read at all. They also weren&amp;#39;t very happy with our house I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope we don&amp;#39;t have to go back. And I hope it&amp;#39;s ok to post this. Even tho I don&amp;#39;t need advice anymore.

I lost my job, didn\'t pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won\'t release it.\n\nI was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I\'m not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn\'t even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I\'m not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn\'t say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don\'t have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).\n\nSo then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn\'t afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don\'t really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can\'t pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I\'m about to owe.\n\nWhen he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a "sorry, computer error you are free to go" and I was released.\n\nWhat can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can\'t even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I\'ll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.\n\nEDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told "good luck". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.', 'author_fullname': 't2_2i82pj4s', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case.

He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn&amp;#39;t afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don&amp;#39;t really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can&amp;#39;t pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I&amp;#39;m about to owe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a &amp;quot;sorry, computer error you are free to go&amp;quot; and I was released.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can&amp;#39;t even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I&amp;#39;ll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told &amp;quot;good luck&amp;quot;. Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': '9skxh8', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'whyiscorporatecrazy', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 300, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/9skxh8/i_was_arrested_kept_in_jail_for_62_days_and_then/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9skxh8/i_was_arrested_kept_in_jail_for_62_days_and_then/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1540875798.0, 'num_crossposts': 12, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': '', 'author_fullname': 't2_2f3rdt6c', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Deadbeat dad ditched my mom when she was pregnant with me 50 years ago (they were married).

I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.\n\nSo, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.\n\n(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)\n\nMy brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.\n\nDuring the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.\n\nSuffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.\n\nSo, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.", 'author_fullname': 't2_360k13bw', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 5, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Update, my son took the Boba Fett figure.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/legaladvice', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_aoi94x', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.84, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 32137, 'total_awards_received': 14, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 32137, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 8, 'gid_2': 5, 'gid_3': 1}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1549643592.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.legaladvice', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did.

Well, because I feel like I need to be. I&amp;#39;m not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I&amp;#39;m here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn&amp;#39;t help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We&amp;#39;re just to different in some senses. He&amp;#39;s a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i&amp;#39;m the exact opposite. In these past few years we&amp;#39;ve tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn&amp;#39;t see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn&amp;#39;t feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don&amp;#39;t feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry about that. Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it&amp;#39;s was worth a total of 2,200$.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn&amp;#39;t realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won&amp;#39;t elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t need pity. I&amp;#39;m doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None,

I\'ve been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn\'t going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don\'t let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). \n\nFor those who didn\'t see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I\'m going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments.

Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don\'t know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I\'m sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don\'t want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don\'t want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. \n\nI was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don\'t know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn\'t recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn\'t be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt\'s house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. \n\nAfter moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn\'t stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn\'t actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn\'t have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can\'t recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn\'t "look" like an abuser or because I wasn\'t "like" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn\'t one. But I am. I can\'t take back what I\'ve done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. \n\nIn conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I\'ve learned this behavior and it\'s voluntary, it\'s totally within my control to change it. I\'ve also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don\'t worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). \n\nThank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I\'m sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.\n\n**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.\n\n**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn\'t expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. \nI wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:\n\n1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn\'t reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. \n\n2. I didn\'t post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I\'m not sure why I did it, but I don\'t think "congrats" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don\'t know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. \n\n3. I\'ve had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I\'d rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google "batterer intervention programs in my area." I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don\'t think.\n\n4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real "friends" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say "oh I\'m perfect now so I can do what I want," trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as "that creepy kid" at my new college. \n\nPlease get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive.

It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure.

Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.\n\nThe place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.\n\nUntil they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.\n\nThey knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.\n\nThey got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.\n\nFrom there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.\n\nWhen I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.\n\nI don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.\n\nMy big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.\n\nThat's it for me.

I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I\'m around they never mention any group names or what "organization" they work for or are apart of.

They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more "stable" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn\'t think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their "mind awakening" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it.

I\'m currently at a friends house and this is the only way I\'ve actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy.

My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i\'ve had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he\'s been "informed" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn\'t answer. He lives in another state so it\'s kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I\'m at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she\'s trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it\'s "full of lies from them".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was "trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view".

He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great.

I got surgery and took FMLA. Luckily I didn’t have to undergo chemo or radiation. Surgery was able to remove all my tumors. I still have check ups and screenings occasionally and have to miss work. Another coworker in another department has breast cancer but unfortunately was unable to hand it removed by only surgery and had to be out longer. She is still undergoing treatment. \n\nI declined reconstruction on my breasts so I was able to come back to work at 3 1/2 weeks. My FMLA is intermittent. I do take it occasionally for those check ups and screenings because I am at high risk of it returning. \n\nI have no breast on my left side (just a flat scar - no breast tissue) and I have no nipple and only a smaller amount of breast tissue on my right side (they removed a lot of breast tissue with a lumpectomy but were able to salvage about 55% of the breast tissue). I have no nipples. \n\nI did something very dumb because I am a very dumb person. \n\nMy coworkers and my immediate supervisor have been talking about my breast cancer for weeks because I had to miss an important meeting for a breast MRI and a bone scan. I requested off. Got my manager and HR to approve it. Converted under my FMLA signed by my oncologist. \n\nThey have been spreading rumors that because I came back to work so soon that I didn’t have breast cancer. I wear a prosthetic at work so no one sees me flat. They are saying everyone they know with any cancer always has to take a lot of time off work and I seem fine. \n\nThey (coworkers and supervisor , not my manager or HR) are saying I am abusing FMLA. \n\nSomeone said they saw me out at the store (after an oncology appointment that was approved by my manager I did stop by the grocery store on my way home) and I looked fine. Again I am not on chemo so my appointments are check ups and blood draws. I feel fine after. They are emotionally draining but physical I feel great. \n\nIt got to the point where I was scared to even take appointments because I knew coming back to work would be the worst. Again, my manager has always been supportive and HR too. This is just my supervisor and my coworkers. \n\nI have a surgery coming up to help with some scarring. They are just going to clean up some of the tissue now that everything has healed and I have been cancer free for over a year. I let my supervisor know they are thinking about scheduling it for the summer and he said “right the cancer thing again”. \n\nOne particular day last week, I got upset because I heard them in the office next door talking about me. They were saying I was scamming everyone and that I didn’t deserve the upcoming raises. About how I didn’t have cancer. I got upset and I walked over and I lifted my shirt and prosthetic bra and showed them the scars on my chest. I did cover my remaining 55% there breast with no nipple with my hand but my scars were on display for all to see. \n\nI then told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my desk. This was on Friday at 3:30 pm. I left at 4:30 like I always do. No one has said anything. It is now Monday and I am worried. I had time to think over the weekend and realized it was a huge mistake. I should have just gone to HR about the gossip. \n\nI have seen my manager but they haven’t said anything. My supervisor hasn’t said anything. None of my gossiping coworkers have said anything. The ones that don’t gossip haven’t said anything and are acting like normal. \n\nWhat should I do to un-mess this up? What can I expect them to do to me legally? Could the coworkers I exposed my chest to call the police? My husband said they likely could but probably wouldn’t. Do I get a lawyer now and ask his advice? Would I hurt myself more by going to my manager and HR and saying “ I messed up”? I am so worried and confused. Any legal advice would be appreciate.

After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don\'t want to sue anyone if I don\'t have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed\n\nUltimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn\'t know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just "suspended" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being "honest" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don\'t waste each other\'s time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.\n\nI asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn\'t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then "maybe" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.\n\nAnyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.\n\nWhen I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.\n\nHe told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.\n\nSo now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\n\nEdit: I\'m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I\'m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it\'s not as "intense" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn\'t give me the "crash" that Adderall does when wearing off.

I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn&amp;#39;t sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&amp;#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then &amp;quot;maybe&amp;quot; they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;m going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I&amp;#39;m taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it&amp;#39;s not as &amp;quot;intense&amp;quot; as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn&amp;#39;t give me the &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; that Adderall does when wearing off. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'coin_price': 500, 'id': 'gid_2', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 100, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 7, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.', 'end_date': None, 'sticky_duration_seconds': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Gold', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': '8vg94j', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'ODoyles_Banana', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 4, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': True, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/8vg94j/update_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8vg94j/update_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1530510247.0, 'num_crossposts': 6, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': "[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)\n\nI have both good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news is that I won the battle with my ex.

Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.\n\n Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog\'s owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. \n\nSo they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their "right" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. \n\nSo we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. \n\nWe had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like "do you have any antifreeze?" I was really taken aback and I think I asked "I think so, do you need some?" \n\nHe then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn\'t know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn\'t stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of "being cruel to his dogs." I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. \n\n\nThe officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn\'t comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a "specialist" over to our house and look through our "internet history" to see what we\'ve been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I\'m not sure what he\'d be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they\'d be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define "specialist" and "internet history" and he said that at this time he couldn\'t do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) "not yet." \nI asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his "specialist" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. \n\nI just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it\'s insane to just the police look through the nebulous "internet history" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. \n\nShe thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren\'t freaking guilty and it\'s there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people\'s dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I\'m actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. \n\nThank you very much for any advice. \n\ntl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned.

I’m sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don’t want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. \n\nSo thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM\'s, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren\'t next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don\'t have the ability to set up any sort of device. \n\nI took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. \n\nHe was very cool and said that he didn\'t want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he\'d try put a call in to figure out "off the record" what was really going on. \n\n\nSo basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I\'ve ever encountered). The can\'t even really remember where they buried it (or don\'t want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn\'t hear from the police again. \n\nSo our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can\'t bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn\'t know how successful we\'ll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing. \n', 'author_fullname': 't2_2t3fcn6r', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': '[update](AZ) Our neighbor\'s dog was apparently poisoned and because we had complained about the dog barking, police wanted to go through our "internet history."', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/legaladvice', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_a7odcn', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.94, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 24888, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 24888, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1545259881.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1545239674.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.legaladvice', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: hey guys I’m involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once.

neighbors child who\'s 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.\n\nAt first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she\'s in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.\n\nI\'ve installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. \n\nShe will climb the fence into my yard (6\' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I\'ve fixed her letting my dogs "free" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then "free" them. \n\nNumerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don\'t know what the purpose is other than it\'s something she just has to do for whatever reason.\n\nWhen she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I\'m not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I\'ve chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.\n\nNow I\'m not really blaming her because she mentally doesn\'t know any better, she has some very severe issues and she\'s damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).\n\nI just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I\'m not home she could very well drown. That\'s why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that\'s it.\n\nI\'ve called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people\'s yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I\'ve now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.\n\nI feel like I\'ve done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further.

I don&amp;#39;t know what the purpose is other than it&amp;#39;s something she just has to do for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I&amp;#39;m not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I&amp;#39;ve chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not really blaming her because she mentally doesn&amp;#39;t know any better, she has some very severe issues and she&amp;#39;s damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I&amp;#39;m not home she could very well drown. That&amp;#39;s why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people&amp;#39;s yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I&amp;#39;ve now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I&amp;#39;ve debated calling the police when she enters but I don&amp;#39;t know how that will escalate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None,

About a year after we moved in, the previous owner showed up at our front door and tried to push past my sister to get into the house, saying she owned it. She left after threatening to call the police, but showed up 4-5 more times over the next 1.5 years, doing the same thing. She brought the police herself once, and they told her to leave once we showed him our contracts from closing on the house. He said that if she came back it would be considered trespassing, and included in his paperwork that she wasn't welcome on the property-- fortunately she hasn't been back since then. We invested in a Ring doorbell and security cameras near each door after the first two visits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that she brought us to housing court in 2018 to try to evict us (from the house we own) but did not show up because she put our address down as her own in the paperwork, therefore never received the notice to appear since her copy was mailed to us. Fortunately we have title insurance and they send a lawyer to represent us for free, and the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. About a year later, she did the exact same thing but showed up to court saying she has a certified deed to the house so she owns it. The same lawyer represented this time, and the judge dismissed it again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mail part:\n\nA bit over a year ago we began receiving her monthly phone bill in the mail (she didn't just forget to change the address after she moved, there was a 2-3 year gap with no mail in her name) so my husband brought a few of them, unopened, to the post office, explained what had been going on, and they said they'd take care of it.

About a year after we moved in, the previous owner showed up at our front door and tried to push past my sister to get into the house, saying she owned it. She left after threatening to call the police, but showed up 4-5 more times over the next 1.5 years, doing the same thing. She brought the police herself once, and they told her to leave once we showed him our contracts from closing on the house. He said that if she came back it would be considered trespassing, and included in his paperwork that she wasn&amp;#39;t welcome on the property-- fortunately she hasn&amp;#39;t been back since then. We invested in a Ring doorbell and security cameras near each door after the first two visits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that she brought us to housing court in 2018 to try to evict us (from the house we own) but did not show up because she put our address down as her own in the paperwork, therefore never received the notice to appear since her copy was mailed to us. Fortunately we have title insurance and they send a lawyer to represent us for free, and the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. About a year later, she did the exact same thing but showed up to court saying she has a certified deed to the house so she owns it. The same lawyer represented this time, and the judge dismissed it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mail part:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bit over a year ago we began receiving her monthly phone bill in the mail (she didn&amp;#39;t just forget to change the address after she moved, there was a 2-3 year gap with no mail in her name) so my husband brought a few of them, unopened, to the post office, explained what had been going on, and they said they&amp;#39;d take care of it. Then in summer 2019, the key to our mailbox no longer worked-- it turned out she brought her deed to the post office, said she lost her key, and asked them to change the lock and give her a new key.

Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. \n\nSo I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he\'s largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone "outside the city\'s little sphere of influence". \n\nSkipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn\'t able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about " squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services". 😉\n\nOnce I updated the website and the city realized I wasn\'t going to take it down, a different attorney from the city\'s law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and "we both want what\'s best" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn\'t think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I\'d get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn\'t like.\n\nOf course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What\'s more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying "there may be legal stuff coming down the road".\n\nA few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing "on his own time" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn\'t a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.\n\nThis was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.\n\nI spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:\n\n1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can\'t threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.\n2. They must pay legal damages to me.\n3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.\n4. They must write an apology letter to me.\n5. My favorite part, the city\'s staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.\n\nAll in all, I\'m incredibly impressed with the ACLU\'s work on this case. I know it\'s not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. I\'m super grateful to the ACLU for helping me with this, because as I said above, I wouldn\'t have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat.

My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. \n\nHe also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn\'t have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor\'s hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5\' across). I don\'t know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they\'re investigating but don\'t know anything else. Not sure if they\'ll tell me anything anyways.\n\nI brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8\' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I "maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that\'s what provoked it, and thanks to y\'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him.

My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn&amp;#39;t have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor&amp;#39;s hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5&amp;#39; across). I don&amp;#39;t know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they&amp;#39;re investigating but don&amp;#39;t know anything else. Not sure if they&amp;#39;ll tell me anything anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8&amp;#39; high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I &amp;quot;maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do&amp;quot;. Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that&amp;#39;s what provoked it, and thanks to y&amp;#39;alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': '5wgevt', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'DeadDrone999', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 2, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': True, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/5wgevt/update_dog_ate_neighbors_drone/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5wgevt/update_dog_ate_neighbors_drone/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1488197916.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': 'Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I\'ve seen him half my life. \n\nI get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I\'m not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn\'t a big secret I want to keep, they don\'t really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don\'t test for information like say illicit drugs. \n\nThe first time I had this work done, I hadn\'t been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it\'s not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother\'s, I was a little tipped off that I wasn\'t called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. \n\nAt this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn\'t worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn\'t think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. \n\nI ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, "it\'s not a big deal - I\'m your mom!"\n\nSince then, I\'ve been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don\'t really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I\'m sure other people do without even knowing it. I don\'t have resources really for a lawyer.

I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don&amp;#39;t want money, I just want her stopped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know what to do, and I&amp;#39;m scared she&amp;#39;s going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn&amp;#39;t stop it sooner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For reference, I am 19 years old and I live in Colorado&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'a0iywd', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'throwaway4201979', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 189, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/a0iywd/co_my_retired_piano_teacher_who_sexually_abused/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0iywd/co_my_retired_piano_teacher_who_sexually_abused/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1543235754.0, 'num_crossposts': 2, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': "Due to the huge amount of PMs and chats that I've received and the fact that people in our district are identifying us by this post, I have removed the story to avoid being doxxed.

She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she\'d have someone beat us up.  \n\nWe called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. \n\nOur lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven\'t so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. \n\nThe video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.

Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. \n\nThere was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they\'re in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. \n\nI honestly can\'t tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. \n\nEither way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. \n\nThank you all so much for your advice and guidance.

\n\nShort version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!\n\nLong version:\n\nIf you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.\n\nShe really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.\n\nThe childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.\n\nSo I have my baby daughter!\n\nTaking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! \n\nAs most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.\n\nThank you all.

It\'s been over a month and i\'m sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn\'t the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i\'m settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won\'t be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn\'t work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn\'t contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn\'t take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been "corrupted" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I\'ll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only "safe" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and "save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn\'t reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the "leaders". All to to help me "open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil."During these sessions apparently she finally "realized the truth" and saw me for the "evil spawn I was." According to her I am a "evil seed" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her "good children". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my "worldly possessions" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes "the universe deals with me". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don\'t feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start. Thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help.

It&amp;#39;s been over a month and i&amp;#39;m sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn&amp;#39;t the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i&amp;#39;m settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won&amp;#39;t be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn&amp;#39;t work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn&amp;#39;t contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn&amp;#39;t take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been &amp;quot;corrupted&amp;quot; and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound.

So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'azlw2h', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'StupidQuestion29912', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 3, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': True, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/azlw2h/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/azlw2h/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1552259904.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': "To make a long story short, im a late 20 something living in portland oregon.

I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering.

I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I\'m using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. \n\nI have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn\'t ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. \n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn\'t visit or call and basically things went on as normal. \n\nIn December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I\'m technologically illiterate, with private info removed): \n\n"Jess, \nI want to let you know that we got the results of E\'s scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. \n\nAt this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. \n\nL, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it\'s time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. \n\nAs always, she would love to see/hear from you."\n\n\nshe replied to that email a short time later with "thank you for the update". She didn\'t call or reach out to our daughter at all. \n\nAfter coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she\'d written to her mother. I don\'t know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. \n\nIn January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:\n\n"Jess, \nI wish I didn\'t have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. \n\nDon\'t hesitate to reach out if you need anything." \n\nand then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:\n\n"Jess, \nIn addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that\'s easier for you."\n\nShe replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. \n\nWe did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother\'s, and my wife/daughters\'. \n\nFast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she\'d had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter\'s ashes. \n\nI told her that unfortunately we didn\'t have any "left", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we\'d offered but it was all we had to give. \n\nA few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for "failing to offer her our shared child\'s cremains" and "offering a used necklace" and some other nonsense. \n\nI\'m going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I\'m dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don\'t understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I\'ve been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? \n\nI\'m angry, I\'m tired, and I\'m frustrated. Realistically, I don\'t even have the emotional energy to fight it and I\'m seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away.

The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it&amp;#39;s time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, she would love to see/hear from you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;she replied to that email a short time later with &amp;quot;thank you for the update&amp;quot;. She didn&amp;#39;t call or reach out to our daughter at all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she&amp;#39;d written to her mother. I don&amp;#39;t know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jess, \nI wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jess, \nIn addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that&amp;#39;s easier for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother&amp;#39;s, and my wife/daughters&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she&amp;#39;d had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter&amp;#39;s ashes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told her that unfortunately we didn&amp;#39;t have any &amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we&amp;#39;d offered but it was all we had to give. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for &amp;quot;failing to offer her our shared child&amp;#39;s cremains&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;offering a used necklace&amp;quot; and some other nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I&amp;#39;m dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don&amp;#39;t understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I&amp;#39;ve been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry, I&amp;#39;m tired, and I&amp;#39;m frustrated. Realistically, I don&amp;#39;t even have the emotional energy to fight it and I&amp;#39;m seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False,

He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.\n\nAt 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z\'s). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop "he is there, what is going on!?" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.\n\n The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.\n\nHe asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...\n\nSo now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I\'ll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.\n\nI have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the "detonatios" NOT a crying child.

He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z&amp;#39;s). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop &amp;quot;he is there, what is going on!?&amp;quot; The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I&amp;#39;ll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the &amp;quot;detonatios&amp;quot; NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened?

And with good news!\n\nSo first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said "Sand is a weird name for a guy" had me in stitches.\n\nThat said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He\'s a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was "his house", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he\'d avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.\n\nI know some of you were hoping I\'d screw him over for all he\'s worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. \n\nYesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn\'t know what he defined as "the sin of homosexuality", or how he\'d enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. \n\nWe ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren\'t having the conversation with him I\'d think he were a caricature). He\'s a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could "lay down the law" or "set me straight". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.\n\nHe still doesn\'t agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he\'s willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).\n\nThe past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I\'ll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I\'ll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I\'ll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I\'m satisfied.

He&amp;#39;s a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was &amp;quot;his house&amp;quot;, so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he&amp;#39;d avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know some of you were hoping I&amp;#39;d screw him over for all he&amp;#39;s worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn&amp;#39;t know what he defined as &amp;quot;the sin of homosexuality&amp;quot;, or how he&amp;#39;d enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren&amp;#39;t having the conversation with him I&amp;#39;d think he were a caricature). He&amp;#39;s a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could &amp;quot;lay down the law&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;set me straight&amp;quot;. He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He still doesn&amp;#39;t agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he&amp;#39;s willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I&amp;#39;ll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I&amp;#39;ll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I&amp;#39;ll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I&amp;#39;m satisfied. I&amp;#39;m truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None,

a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.\n\nEarly in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.\n\nIt'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.\n\nAaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.\n\nAaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down &amp; helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.\n\nWe phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.\n\nI think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?\n\n", 'author_fullname': 't2_2ph36hsf', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': "NSW Australia.

I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I&amp;#39;d had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn&amp;#39;t let water in the car btw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aaron didn&amp;#39;t even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down &amp;amp; helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he&amp;#39;d have made it across. Admittedly I&amp;#39;m 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;d have made much difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven&amp;#39;t spoken since and he&amp;#39;s avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It&amp;#39;s asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think he&amp;#39;s being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it&amp;#39;s not up to me to sit in someone&amp;#39;s car when they&amp;#39;re doing something dumb is it? Ideally I&amp;#39;d like to post him this link and responses if they&amp;#39;re what I think they&amp;#39;ll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it&amp;#39;s for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own &amp;#39;stop this you bunch of goons&amp;#39; letter?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': None, 'coin_price': 500, 'id': 'gid_2', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 100, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 7, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.', 'end_date': None, 'sticky_duration_seconds': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Gold', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': True, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rawz', 'author_is_blocked': False, 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'a2bj15', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'floodweight', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 103, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 2332676, 'created_utc': 1543737550.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'legaladvice', 'selftext': "Original post:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9skxh8/i_was_arrested_kept_in_jail_for_62_days_and_then/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nI've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today.

I’m flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don’t have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. \n\nEdit: I’ve looked all over the internet and can’t find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. \n\nHere’s what happened:\n\n..\n\nI was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. \n\nRight before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. \n\n“You have to put your feet on the ground!” I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. \n\n“No I don’t but okay.” As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I’ve taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. \n\nEven if it’s technically not allowed by some rule I’m not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. \n\nShe immediately escalated: \n“Would you like to go back to the gate? We’re gonna go back to the gate!” And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. \n\nBut right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. \n\nShe came back to my seat and barked: \n“Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.”\n\nMy seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, “no I don’t but okay” are now the cause of a police interrogation. \n\nHer statement caused me to panic inside. I’m now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. \n\nSo I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAm I fucked?', 'author_fullname': 't2_4xqseczv', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 1, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'About to get arrested when I land in Boston', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/legaladvice', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': None, 'downs': 0, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_dr06ws', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.92, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 19284, 'total_awards_received': 2, 'media_embed': {}, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': None, 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 19284, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': '', 'edited': 1572901807.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1572786703.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.legaladvice', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m getting a ton of PMs since this thread is locked.

My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. \n\nThe principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board?

I’ve been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! \n\nThrough the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me “if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?” To which I replied “150%”. He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said “no.” \n\nShortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don’t want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn’t seem happy. As if the whole floor isn’t already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. \n\nI explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. \n\nThe bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I’m guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.\n\nThe city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they “didn’t know” and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from “submit a maintenance request” to “we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately” in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. \n\nThank you so much Reddit!!!

We went from “submit a maintenance request” to “we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately” in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much Reddit!!!
