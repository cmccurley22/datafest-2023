0,0,Can my parents/school force me to take heart medication?,"I'm 15 and a boy, I live in New York (state).

Several months ago I had a heart burn that was misinterpreted by doctors to be a ""heart attack"" (it wasn't, simply put, severe over exaggeration.) Since then I've been made to take ""medication"" at home, which I don't want to bc I've read about the side affects and I don't want to be taking something for an issue that doesn't exist.

Since I got it originally I just stopped taking the pills, which long story short my parents found out about and it has been a very big fight with them since. They have contacted my (public) school and after they had a talk with me and the principal basically what has been happening is I come in in the morning and they force me to go in a room with the guidance conseuler and an extra person and watch me swallow the pills that I ""need"". For some time I'd go and make myself vomit immediately after in the bathroom and they found out and now I have to stay for twenty minutes and drink water. They do not let me go to classes if I refuse.

How can this be legal? I'm sorry to ask here but I literally cannot find information on this anywhere. Where would I even report this if the principal is in on it?"
1,1,University expulsion due to cheating,"TL;DR: Cheated on two exams during my last semester of university by obtaining a professor's login information and seeing the exams before they were given. Professor gave me an F in the course but passed the information along to higher-ups, who subsequently expelled me. I will be appealing my case, I have a few more days to send in an appeal letter. After I send in my appeal I am entitled (based on the code of conduct) to a hearing in front of the dean. I have contacted an attorney who is looking at everything. I want to know what the best course of action is to make my chances as strong as possible in getting my sanctions lessened. Location is United States.

&#x200B;

The course I cheated in was NOT a major course. I completed all of my major courses by merit, and this is my first cheating offense. I have never been accused of misconduct or wrongdoing in my 4 years at this university.

First and foremost - I have reached out to an attorney who has recommended me a few things, but I wanted to come here as well for any and all advice. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

Backstory:

Sometime in February, I planted a camera behind the keyboard in the classroom where my professor lectured. Once she typed in her login information, I was able to view the video and obtain her login information to use for my own personal benefit. On dozens of occasions, I logged on using the professor’s login information on school computers in labs that have cameras, and viewed exams, past labs, and even changed my own grade in the course. The first exam, around late march, I had seen the answer key prior to taking the exam, and naturally got a 100% on the exam. No suspicion was raised by the professor. I continued to view answer keys prior to the next exam, which was taken in late april. My exams were very identical to the answer keys. I had noticed that the professor changed her password after the second exam when I went to login again, and so I put the camera back in the same place as the first time. However this time, at some point during the video it shows her looking directly at the camera, implying that she did indeed see it.  In the beginning of May about a week after the second exam, my professor came up to me after class and asked for me to come with her to the department chair’s office. When I sat down, the department chair told me that there was a strong suspicion of me cheating on exams 1 and 2, and asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them. I said “I admit, I cheated on them.” That is all I said. I did not admit to how I cheated. Afterwards, he asked me how I cheated, to which I did not respond. They had me sign a form essentially stating that I admitted to cheating and that they were going to pass along the information to the academic affairs committee for further investigation and potentially further sanctions on top of an F in the course. About a week later, a police officer from the university came to my apartment and asked me to come with him. He drove me to the campus police station, where I was questioned about “illegal computer usage.” An hour later, at the academic affairs office, I was informed verbally that I was going to be expelled from the university, and a day later, I received a letter reiterating the fact that I had been expelled. The letter says that I will not get a degree, can not participate in graduation, and can not be readmitted to the university, now or in the future.

&#x200B;

I reached out to an attorney yesterday, and will be meeting with him tomorrow.

&#x200B;

The steps I am taking for this:

&#x200B;

The university allows students to appeal the decision within 5 days of receiving the letter, which I am doing. Essentially the appeal that I have written states that I admit my actions were egregious, and that I felt so much pressure to pass the course and felt awful when I cheated even before I got caught. I said that I wanted to fess up but didn't know how, and that when I was confronted I did not at all try to justify my actions, hide them, or lie. I came clean completely, and the burden was finally off. In my appeal I am respectfully asking for my sanctions to be lessened to at most a suspension from the university so that I can still graduate, albeit not on time.

&#x200B;

I have not yet sent the letter, as I still have a few more days to submit the appeal, and I am waiting for my attorney to look at the letter tomorrow and give me any advice. The reason I got an attorney was so that I could either:

a) heavily grovel (an attorney cannot be present during the hearing) and the attorney would just help me before I go in

b) basically sue the school saying the sanctions are too harsh

&#x200B;

I will NOT be denying my actions. The school has sufficient proof that I used the professor's login credentials for my own benefit. I have to come clean, and just hope that the school shows mercy. If the appeal does not go well, I will resort to plan B, which is getting the attorney directly involved.

&#x200B;

Any advice on what I should say during the hearing, or anything else I should do?"
2,2,Do I have a free car?,"FROM: California, USA. 

So the small amount of background to this story is that, I recently (3 months ago) leased a new car. After three months of no bills, I checked in, and figured out the following had happened to the contract. 

When filing the contract with the auto dealer, Nissan kicked back the contract because of a very small error ($1.75 tax in Cali per tire, but they taxed a 5th, backup tire that my car doesn’t come with). They sent it back to the dealership to be fixed, but in that time, the dealership was sold to someone else. 

The lease was pretty much in limbo, with really being in no place at the time that it had been sold. Nissan didn’t have it, and the new company didn’t have it. 

Now, the new dealership is sending us a contract to be signed. Do we have any legal obligation to sign, or could we just go down to the DMV and remove them from the lease, since there’s no contractual evidence that gives them any ownership over the car?

It’s obvious that people think I’m trying to defend myself in my comments but what I’m really trying to do is offer more information. It’s obvious from the conversations I’ve had with the new dealership that they don’t have a legal claim to the car, and that’s what I’ve attempted to describe. Thanks for downvoting me for that."
3,3,Prank gone wrong (Michigan),"We were out on a school retreat this weekend. Everyone in this story is 18 if that's relevant. 

My buddy has long hair that he wanted to cut. He's been growing it out for a while and it's basically his signature. As a prank, we decided to come up behind him and cut his hair off and make everyone think he wasn't in on it.

He was wearing a blue flannel and so was a girl on the trip. I cut the wrog person's hair. I realized as soon as I closed the scissors, but a chunk of hair was gone right up to her scalp, probably about a foot and a half long.

She cried a lot, but when she parted her hair on the side you couldn't tell. She went to a fancy salon and got it fixed with extensions or something and apparently it cost like $200 even though you could barely see the difference when she parted her hair.

Today I heard from a lot of people at school that her parents made a police report and that she's going to sue me for almost $1k. Can they really do this!? How much trouble will I get in? I'd be willing to pay for her initial haircut (even though it apparently cost like $200 which seems outrageous) but I think she's being ridiculous. She looks fine and honestly she'd look cute if she just cut it all off anyway. Should I get a lawyer?"
4,4,Pronouns and compelled speech,"A University professor (a public university in North Carolina) has given a friend of mine a beginning -of-class survey that requests his preferred pronouns. It is the only required question on the survey. 

I’ve tried to talk him into just doing it so that he doesn’t lose recommendation letters etc. but he says that he doesn’t want to “be forced to tacitly endorse the metaphysical beliefs of the liberal upper class by participating in its rituals.”

We both agree that we have no idea what his rights are in this situation and I’m curious to know as well since it’s only a matter of time before I’m in a similar situation; so I looked to see if there’s a subreddit for this kind of thing—that brought us here. What are our rights?"
5,5,California. I've been experiencing work place bullying for a year. At multiple employers. I'm currently in contact with a laywer who specializes in hostile work environment but I may not be to prove that it was because I was a protected class. What else can I do?,"I keep getting bullied at work by competitive girls. These girls will start rumors about me so I will have no friends and no support from management. (If you want more specific details, feel free to ask in the comments. It will help me organize my thoughts) I was going to let it go but the stress from the situation has aged me about 10 years and has aggravated my depression and anxiety to the point where I may not be able to work again. My hands shake when I'm stressed and they never did before. Me and my husband are very stretched financially as a result. I have health problems that may be effecting my ability to have children and I can't go to the doctor for it because of the financial strain that this situation has caused. I can't seem to work anywhere without girls trying to get me to quit. I have social anxiety and this has been very damaging to me and management never helps. I just need whatever information you can give me about what my options are if I can't pursue a case for hostile work environment. I'm 33 and I shouldn't feel like I need to apply for disability."
6,6,Update: Help! The California State took everything!,"I have been asked to post an update on what happened, and how everything worked out.  Especially since [this redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/43w613/my_entire_savings_account_was_emptied_because_of/) could use the information.

Tl;Dr: Money Stolen by DCS, threatened to end two lawyers careers and file federal suit, everything is better now.

Recap:
When the story last left off, someone at Bank of America was able to help me get a provisional credit.  This was set to expire on the following Monday evening and I was to come into the bank first thing Monday morning.

I called out sick to work for Monday in advance warning on Saturday that I could not come in, and explained the situation to work.  They seemed bewildered that this was even possible and were completely understanding.

On Monday morning, I went into the branch and brought in EVERY form of ID that I had.   I had my Social Security card, with my name.  My passport, my birth certificate, my drivers license, and I happened to have a letter from the SS Administration stating that my SS # belongs to me (this was something a different bank at one time suggested I have on hand in case of identity theft).    All of the information was scanned into their system and we called Bank of America legal. I do not know who exactly because the person at the branch handled that side and could not disclose much.   The person in legal had access to the court order and was able to verify that the name on the letters did not match my account.  Only the SSN matched.  Given all of my proof of my identity they had no choice but to immediately put my money back at Bank of America's expense (even though it had already been turned over to the state) or face possible legal repercussions from the improper seizure of assets of the wrong account holder.  I was given an apology for the situation, but a recommendation that I work out the issues with the state.

So, I had all of my money back, by 5 PM that day.  Awesome!  They also helped me work out some other issues relating to my stocks, investments, and other stuff at the same time.  I had them not perform any other changes to my account at the time, but they were more than helpful in answering some other questions I had.

After this, I checked my other accounts and found all of the funds, stocks and other things I had with other companies had been released as they deemed the court orders to be defective.  (I didn't even need to call them for this to happen, it was amazing.)

I called the California Department of Child Services main line, and got the run-around again.  However, at this point everyone at that office had heard my story, just none of them could give me any information because it ""was not my case to be given information on.""  I did get some hints at the kinds of questions I needed answered though, so I hung up and called back.

""Hi, my name is Gloria I cannot seem to find what district my case is out of so that I can call them directly.  The case number is blahblahblah.""
Response: ""Ah yes, Gloria, what SSN do we have on file for your case so we can confirm your identity.""
""My SSN is 000-111-1234"" (insert actual SSN)
Response: ""Ah, thank you, yes, your case is out of our Los Angeles district, would you like me to transfer you?""
""Sure!""
 For the record, I am not Gloria nor do I sound like Gloria, but that was what they needed to hear and I could hear a slight chuckle on the other side because, at this point, they had to know who I was but we had to play the game.

Once transferred I listened COMPLETELY to the prompts.
X if your a parent/guardian
X if your so and so
Press option 3 if your a lawyer with...

Well, option 1 and 2 didn't work... lets press 3 and see what happens.
""Thank you for calling Department of Child Services, so and so speaking, how can I help you?""
""Ah, can you confirm I have been transferred to the Los Angeles district?""
""Yes sir, how can I help?""
""I needed to speak to the attorneys handling case number blahblahblah.""
""Are you a lawyer representing a party to the case?""
""In a round-about manner of speaking, yes.""
""ok, well, I regret to inform you that the attorney handling the case is out on vacation for the next few days, would you like me to transfer you to her supervisor?""
""That would be AMAZING, per chance, what is her supervisors name?""
""Her name is Julia Nicholson""
""Thank you so much.  I'll hold while you transfer me.""
---
""Hi this is Julia Nicholson, I hear you are calling about case blah blah blah, how can I help""
""Hi Julia, my name is Saphirabrightscales, in short, the Department of Child Services has stolen my identity and transposed it on this case.  Your department has illegally levied all of my assets without due process, violating my constitutional rights.  I want everything back.""
""... er, excuse me.?""
""Julia, I am pretty sure you heard me correctly.  But to repeat.... (repeated what I said above).""
""Well, we are not the department that handles disputes.. you will need to contact the disputes department at... XXX-xxx-XXXX""
""Julia, I have tried. But they report they will not release my funds for 30-45 days.  Given that I am not a party to this case and in no way involved, I do not find that acceptable for violating my constitutional rights.  Would you?""
""No, I suppose I wouldn't.""
""Great.  Then we are on the same page.  Just in case this has not already been made clear, your department **STOLE** my SSN and put it on someone else case, violating the Fourth and Fifth amendment in the process.   If, you cannot return my funds within 24 hours, then I will file a case in federal court for violation of civil rights and liberties and I will personally see to it that your attorney and yourself are disbarred for it as well.  Am I clear?""
""Yes sir.  Can I ask some questions?""
""Sure, go for it.""
""You are not Juan Garcia?""
""No I am not.""
""You are not Gloria?""
""I am sure you can tell that by my voice, but no I am not.""
""Right.  Are you a party to or have you ever been a party to a case with DCS?""
""No, and to be clear, I have only had sex with two people in my life.  Neither of whom have children, both of whom I have spoken to in the past day.  Also, I am likely unable to have children at all.""
""I see.  I am sorry to hear that. Well, um... looking through the records it appears a clerical error was made in inputting the SSN in some records.""
""Great.  So you can fix it quickly then.""
""Well, we need to speak with the judge and other attorneys and we need to figure out where the funds are, it may take some time.. we need at least a week to...""
""Ok.  Well, then I guess I will see you in Federal Court in Washington State after I file the case, you might want to pack some warmer clothing if you are not used to the weather.  I will let you know when I have details on your and your attorneys disbarment procedures..""
""Wait.  Um...  I have some other things to do at the courthouse today and will see to it that we get this process rolling.  I cannot do it all in 24 hours, but I can get it done in the next two days.  At least your money back.  It will take longer than that to get your SSN off of records.""
""Ok, well, 48 hours is reasonable and I will hold you to that.  I want to let you know, Bank of America legal is already involved in this process as well and is waiting to hear from your office.""
""Ok, I understand.  I will get your information over to our fraud department and get this going right now.  Expect to hear from someone within an hour.""
""Ok, I will call you back if I don't hear back in an hour.""
""I understand.  Again, I am sorry about all of this.""
""I appreciate your help.  We will be in touch.""

Shortly thereafter someone from DCS called me and asked me to email any documentation I have of my identity to them.  I gave them all I had.  They asked for a pay stub or bill showing my address and I gave that as well.  The person was more than kind about the whole thing, but it was very procedural. I was asked questions of ""have you ever worked at?, have you ever lived at?, do you know someone at?"" the answer was no to everything. He assured me they would be sending me letters and emails with documentation for me to prove that this was all cleared up, just in case something came up in records later.

The following morning at 8 AM SHARP (to the second) I got a call from Bank of America, head of a legal department that handles levy's.  It was an apology, they admitted that they should never have taken the funds from my account because the wrong name was on all of the paperwork.  It was a defective court order and should not have been followed but returned as such.  At the very least, they should have called me to confirm what was going on.  The apologized and informed me that they were initiating a review of their procedures to prevent this from ever happening in the future.  I informed them that I did not place all of the blame on them, someone at DCS made the first mistake.  I also thanked them for their help in resolving it quickly.  They also informed me that they had received a letter overnighted from DCS ordering them to release my funds immediately and confirmed that there was a clerical error on their end.

Over the next week I had to field more random calls from DCS of ""have you ever? Did you?"" again, all ""No"" but I was as polite as I could be about the whole thing.   After a week, complete silence.

Randomly on an (I think) Wednesday I received four overnighted letters from Bank of America.  ""We regret to inform you that we have received a court order from the State of California seizing all assets in the accounts listed below and in the amounts listed.""
Oh shit... I cannot believe... (as I continue reading)
""0.00 | Checking""
""0.00 | Savings""
""0.00 | Joint Savings""
""A service fee of 0.00 has been charged to each of the accounts for this service.  Thank you, Bank of America""

I must admit, I laughed.  The state had AGAIN attempted to levy everything, but Bank of America had denied it..  So, back to the phones, I called the attorneys cell phone and informed her what had happened through voicemail ""Hi this is Saphirabrightscales, if you recall all of my assets had been levied illegally, yeah.., well I got a letter from the bank today informing me that DCS had attempted this again. I need an immediate call back with an explanation.  If I *do not* get a call back by 5 PM tonight, I will file my federal case as soon as the courts open in the morning.""
I also called and left the same voicemail with the person handling the fraud part.

15-30 minutes later I get a call back from someone I had not worked with previously at the fraud department. ""Hi, Mr. Brightscales.  My name is Angela with the Department of Child Services.. I.. well, I have been handling your case.""
You could hear in her voice, she had just been yelled at by someone, and completely blown up on.  It was the voice of someone who was caught not doing their job and had definitely heard about it from her boss.
""Yes, so, what is going on?""
""Well your information has been removed from our records and the only thought I have is that it was just paperwork still working its way through our system.  I apologize.  Did you not get our letter stating that your name has been removed from our system?""
""No, I have received no letters from DCS ever.""
""Oh.  Well I sent it..  Could I get your address?  It seems I do not have it on file here.""   (How did she send it without it being on file?  Whatever...)
""Sure, it is blah blah at blah blah, Washington.  Can you email me a copy just in case?""
""Yes, I will have that out right now.  Sorry about the confusion.""

I had that letter in my email five minutes later, and in my mail box the next day.

So far, that has been it.  No other repercussions.   I lost a days pay dealing with it all (used sick time.) But honestly, while I can file with the state of California for reimbursement and try to make the case for that, it is not worth my time and I have decided to let it go. I am thankful at how quickly it was handled, but what it took to get it handled was a bit ridiculous.  I wish I could say that I came out ahead for it, but I am just happy to come out even. I hope I never have to threaten to ruin someones career, or file a federal lawsuit and mean it again.

I hope this helps someone else. :)

Edit:  Although I am loathe to respond to any of this.  I hate to say it, yes.  This is exactly how it went down.  I really, truly did not care to post it because it all seemed so outlandish to me that it happened at all and I knew that I would not be taken seriously.  Someone asked for an update, so I did.  I really do not care to prove myself, but I will leave an image of the letter I got. http://imgur.com/UgQmhoW

It all happened as said, lots of crying in-between but other than not including the tears I did my best to not embellish the story as some have a habit of doing.   Good luck, and my only hope is that this helps someone else."
7,7,We put an adopted dog to sleep after severe behavioral issues. The shelter is threatening legal action.,"Us: New Jersey
The Shelter: New York

**Backstory** Skip if you're not interested.

My partner and I have been waiting to be able to have the time and money to care for a dog for 3 years. Over the summer we were ready, and adopted a young mutt. This dog slowly developed severe behavioral issues.

The dog would steal and destroy any object in the house and snap at us if we attempted to stop them. The dog would jump, bite the leash and lunge anytime we saw *any* moving object outside. The dog progressively got less safe to be around. I personally took this dog to the park to run 3 hours everyday day without any noticeable effect. We felt unsafe managing this dog and turned to professional help. 

We got all the mental stimulation toys, went to classes by dog trainers for this type of behavior, and started working with a vet that specialized in behavior issues. We spent the next 2 months running through all of the medication and training tips that the vet provided and that we could find. We had a trainer come to our house. We found nothing that helped. The Vet said that the next steps would be trying medication that could take 6-12 months to dial in. We could not emotionally or financially afford that. We hated life and the dog hated life.

**Present Day**

So we made the decision to euthanize the dog. This was crushing as we had researching, prepping, and waiting for our first family dog for years and felt like failures. The Vet Behaviorist and the administering Vet agreed with our decision and we did it. I told the shelter after the fact. They were upset as it said in our adoption contract, that if for any reason we were unable to take care of the dog, we were to return them. It does say that. I don't want to talk about why we did not return the dog. 

Today we got a letter in the mail from what looks like a law firm. 80% of the letter is explaining to us how awful we are, with the last 20% asking for funds and demanding to know the contact information for the Vet to verify that we didn't just shoot the dog. They are asking for fees incurred from taking care of the dog. Food, boarding and training fees, and training gear. About $5k in total.

**Question:** How should we respond?

* Firstly, I will be emailing the lawyer from the contact that I found online. Initial googling comes back that they look real.
* My very not professional opinion that I have gleaned from lurking here is that they would be owed the value of the dog, not the funds that they put in to the dog. This dog was not a purebred show dog or a training police dog. It was a dog that knew several commands, but that's it.
* Lastly, I would like to run this by a lawyer so that we can have them respond. But what kind? Contract lawyer probably?

Any suggestions, advice, or background info about contract law and animals in NY is appreciated. Thank you."
8,8,"There's a tenant at my apartment complex that has been complaining to my complex. Today, he made up a heniois lie about my roomate and I...","So I live in a really luxurious apartment complex. I'm a web developer that makes good money. However, I grew up poor and ""trashy"" all my life, so I don't look like I belong here. And it seems like there is at least one tenant wanting me out of there.

So up until today, all of the complaints did have some merrit. I always made sure to take the criticism and not let it happen again. It's always just something small like noise complaints.

Well today I got a call from my apartment complex saying that someone said that my roomate had been leaving his dogs outside for hours on end  and also abuses his dogs.

This is a flat out lie.

The only thing that came even REMOTELY close to the truth was last night, my roommates Chihuahua got out and ran off. The second we go. Odd, my roomate, myself, and his girlfriend who was visiting at the time, all went out and looked for her and called for her for 30 minutes until we found her.

So no one was leaving a dog. And this was the first time it happened. It isn't uncommon for dogs to accidentally get out, and I don't see it a huge deal unless it happens frequently, or if you just let you dog roam and not give any effort in getting your dog back on the leash or inside.

They said that animal control has launched an investigation. And ""tenants have been talking and are really concerned.""

My question is, what is my rights in Tennessee? I have never paid rent late not once.

Whats the likelihood of losing my place to live over an accusation from a tenant that seems to have an out for me? I don't know who I. May be or even why. I always keep to myself and never cause you to ok many problems. Even when I have gotten noise complaints, it wasn't frequent.

I would not consider myself a problem tenant at all. All that is wrong with me is my appearance. And there's nothing I can do because I'm white.

No one ever talks about clasisist discrimination. Not only thst, but I'm also autistic so I may appear to be a little eccentric to the few people I do interact with. But I've never stepped on any toes.

What can I do to protect my place of living?"

I got a call from my closing agent letting me know that I need to go back and sign with the title company again, because they messed up the address on the documents I signed.

10,10,Parental threats because of psychoactive substance use and religious differences. Can I be eligible for asylum in another country because of my situation?,"I’m sorry if this was the wrong subreddit to post in or in a wrong format, I just didn’t know where to go.

A bit of background: I grew up in a more-devout-than-usual Catholic family in a predominantly Catholic country. This did not sit well with me as I grew up and eventually became an atheist. Recently, my parents discovered that I did not believe in God, and that I also used psychoactive mushrooms and cannabis to deal with personal problems. Even though I’m of legal age, I’m still in college. Upon learning that one of my college friends supplied cannabis to me, my father threatened to put me on a leave of absence from schooling and to report my college friend to the authorities. He planned on doing this by cracking down on all drug users in my college as repatriation for my actions, since it is still an illegal substance in my country. Knowing that they were innocent and did not deserve any of this, I reluctantly complied with any of my parents’ demands on the condition that no one be accused of any wrongdoing under our unfair laws. I feel very uncomfortable and unsafe within their presence because of their reactions, and fear the worst as revealing anything further about myself, such as my light bisexuality may result in violence. Unfortunately, my country does not afford any specific protection to individuals such as myself. I feel like my free will has been forcibly stripped away, and that I have no other roof to turn to at this point, which is why I am looking into asylum as an option. Is it appropriate in my situation?

TL;DR: Became an atheist in a hyper-Catholic environment, used cannabis & psychedelic mushrooms but parents found out and threatened to report my course mate supplier to the authorities until I had no choice but to comply to their demands. Expecting further potential violence with no legal protection."
11,11,Vet clinic is using tainted ketamine.,"A friend obtained vials of ketamine from a clinic and I injected it. I've done Ketamine before, and the disassociation feeling was definitely not completely Ketamine. It also made me very nauseous and caused me to non-stop vomit and faint for a day after I took it. I somehow convinced myself that maybe I was having a bad reaction because I drank a beer before, so I tried again, and had the same effect but it was worse this time. My roommate saw me getting sick and took me to the hospital and I now have mad hospital bills.

This is probably a long shot, but can I sue the vetinarian clinic or the distributor for having tainted Ketamine?

12,12,Lost Memories :(,"I dropped my wedding dress off about a year ago at a dry cleaners down the street from my house. I even had it repaired there as well. They called and left a message about 6 months ago saying that it was ready. I went in today to pick it up (as I lost track of time because I recently had a baby), and they told me that they had donated it a month ago. No calls, no messages, no emails, nothing. There is also nothing in my agreement with them that says that they can donate it if it is not picked up. Is there anything I can do legally to sue for the price of the dress/ emotional distress, ect. "

14,14,A failed applicant has accused our business of not hiring him or other black people on account of race — can he sue us based on that accusation alone? Can we sue him for slandering our business?,"We are in Cook County, Illinois.


My brother and I own a small business that we built from scratch while in college, and we're doing quite well. Recently, our manager left us to move out of state with his wife. He was and is a good friend of ours for a long time, and he'd been with us since we started up the business. Until now, we'd been hiring from among people that we know, or at the very least on the basis of recommendations from people that we know, there are many benefits to this, not least because we know who we're dealing with, and knowing who you're dealing with, liking them and feeling comfortable with them is just as important as, if not more important than on-paper qualifications.


To our dismay, we had a rough time finding people who we not only liked, but could do what needed to be done. So, we posted an ad online. Of all the junk we got, one application really stuck out, he didn't give a phone number and said that he didn't have social media to link to (red flag) but he was well qualified and I liked the way that he wrote, so I scheduled a meeting.


As soon as he came in and introduced himself, it became apparent to me that he had misrepresented himself in his emails, and within 5 minutes I was absolutely sure that he wasn't getting hired. His qualifications were good but I didn't like him, and he wouldn't fit in, so it wasn't happening. I rushed the interview along and got him out of my office, thinking that my actions had communicated my disinterest. We wound up promoting one of the guys that worked for us into the vacant position the next day, and easily replaced him in his previous role two days after that. About a week after the interview, the guy came in and asked about the job, I told him a version of the truth — that he didn't seem to be a good fit and we have already filled the position. Instead of graciously accepting what he should've already known, this guy had a tantrum!


He accused me of not hiring him because he was black, called us racists who would rather hire a less qualified white man over a black man with an MBA and said that ""it's obvious"" that we discriminate because all of our employees are white, and there's ""no excuse"" for that in Chicago. I told him that the reason that he wasn't hired was because I didn't like his attitude and I didn't think that he was a good fit and that going to school and getting pieces of paper aren't the only things that make someone qualified. I then told him to leave before I called the police, and then he threatened to sue us and called me a ""racist bitch.""

Does it sound like he has any grounds to sue us? Do we have grounds to sue him for slandering our business? I could really care less about the accusation itself, but it can hurt our reputation. **I am asking this here instead of going straight to a lawyer, as lawyers can be quite expensive, if it seems like we may need a lawyer we'll get one, but we don't want to spend the cash if it's nothing.**

Regardless of what goes on in our heads or what my brother and I say in private conversation with one another or with our wives, we have never given any public indication that we discriminate in our hiring process. Every instance that we have been in a situation of having to turn away a ""bad fit"" we have always given a plausible reason and haven't ever been stupid enough to say to them what we say to ourselves and one another. The composition of our workplace relative to the demographics of the area can be explained by the fact that we mostly hire from amongst our friends aka family, but I don't think that it need be explained, since as a private entity we aren't bound to any sort of racial quota."
15,15,Girlfriend's older brother forced her to sit down and watch certain videos which are against her religious beliefs. Is this domestic abuse? (update),"Ok so my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77mv24/girlfriends_older_brother_forced_her_to_sit_down) was downvoted and then locked. I asked if my girlfriend's big brother can force her to watch videos against her religious beliefs.

Trust me I believed you guys when you said that he can and it's a family matter, so I didn't call the cops or CPS. But I tried to talk to her parents to see what they think of the whole thing. I knew my parents wouldn't like it if someone showed me videos that we find very questionable and then quizzed me on them.

So I went and saw them and told them everything. They didn't like it at all. I mean, they didn't like it that I was talking to them. They told me that I have no right questioning what their son and daughter do and I should know my place. I don't know, I'm her boyfriend and I think I should have the right to be concerned about her wellbeing. They didn't agree.

A couple of days later my girlfriend came to me angrily that I shouldn't have gone to her parents. She says I tried to talk shit about her brother to her parents. But I only told the truth. I don't know why she's still loyal to him, he forced him to watch those videos. She should take my side but she took his side. I tried to press her on it and asked how can she not take my side, I'm her man and her boyfriend. She broke up with me.

I'm very hurt right now. Maybe I messed up. I was just trying to look out for her. Maybe I should have listened to all of you who told me to drop it. I don't know. Maybe we were not compatible. I don't think codependency is a good thing.

Anyway, thank you for your advice. It was the right one and I didn't listen and lost my girlfrienf as a result. "
16,16,"Tried to sue Equifax for data breaches, just got a letter in the mail. HELP!","So with all the craze that was going on lately with the Equifax data breach and thousands suing them across the country, I decided to take them to small claims court. The whole process was fairly easy, I just filled out some papers and was good to go. Well I showed up to the court date, and made sure the court delivered the papers. They did not show up and the judge automatically ruled it in my favor, and I was so happy I won some small change ($435.45). He looked kinda annoyed I was there, but anyway.

Then 2 months later I got a notice from the court saying that Equifax appealed the decision. Then I got a letter in the mail saying to show up to Superior Court instead of just a district court small claims place. I was sort of on edge, and just showed up last week.

It turns out they flew out a team of corporate lawyers from Manhattan. They filed a motion to dismiss and also a 2nd motion. The 2nd motion was for a counter-suit where they want all attorneys fees paid for a frivolous lawsuit. They also list ""JOHN DOE"" as another defendant and I read that means they put a placeholder so they can sue anyone I know. The judge just continued it and when I asked him how long it would take he said possibly years. And a court staff member told me to expect me to be served with papers at my home. The total amount might be in the hundreds of thousands. 

I do NOT have the resources and now I'm scared that they're flying out these lawyers and involving the legal system HELP! I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WANT TO CANCEL THE WHOLE CASE"
17,17,My sister's husband died and I am seven months pregnant by him. Our child wasn't in the will. Are we still entitled to anything?,"Spare me any moral grandstanding.

He died and everything was left to my sister and her kids. I'm pregnant and it's definitely his. My child wasn't in the will but since my child was fathered by him, am I/we entitled to anything? I know he left a lot of money behind but I'm not looking for half. I lost my job and I'm on the verge of being homeless, so just a small cut to tide me over is all I'm looking for.

18,18,Expelled from Texas public school for my afterschool milsim activities/nazi soviet cosplay,"Originally from AITA want advice on it

I  am 100% sure i am not the asshole here but i have lost my girlfriend,  and many other friends over this and its fucking pissing me off so much.  I am active in my local milsim group. Incase you're unfamiliar, milsim  is airsoft but take a lot further, often trying to replicate or reenact  battles from history. We had an event where we were reenacting the  battle of Kiev, 1943 which was fought between the 1st Ukrainian front  and the 4th Panzer army. We all wore either Soviet or Nazi uniforms, and  we had airsoft guns that looked exactly like Mosin Nagats, Kar 98s,  Gewehr 43s, mp40s, lugers and others. Our uniforms looked identical too  and we had soviet and nazi flags on both sides of our fields.

Now  clearly, none of us are nazis or communists, we've done many other ww2  events before, involving soviets and nazis, as well as Vietnam war,  Rhodesian bushwar, and other conflicts. Someone did take pictures of us  though and blasted us on social media and our school found out. They  expelled us instantly. they didn't care what we had to say, they said we  were with nazi flags and unfirosm which waas therefore offensive, so we  had to go. FUCKING SHIT. My parents are fuckign pissed, my dad took out  all my milsim shit and locked it up. He says im going to be grounded  for a long ass time. They're pissed and they don't care what i say.

Fuck  this and fuck my girlfriend and friends who all decided to unfriend me  and disassociate with me, you all are a bunch of fucking pathetic  cowards and fuck my school and everyone else who won't hear me out or  makes bullshit assumptions.

Now on to the advice, can the public schools actually expell me for this? we did this in a different city an hour away. Soemoene who just didn't like us found these pics and spread it around school saying we're nazis. I explained to the school admin that we're not nazis, and that this was just a military reenactment. They said they didn't care, we dressed up as nazis and we're getting expelled."
19,19,Creepy neighbor plays audio of me having sex [Michigan],"I'm 22. My boyfriend lives out of state and every time he visits me at college we of course have sex. Last Friday when we finished my neighbor knocked on the door and and went off on me about how loud we were being. 1. It was a Friday night. 2. We live on a huge college campus town so it's always really loud outside. But anyway I apologized, said I was really sorry for the noise and he left.
  
When I woke upon  Sunday I hear noises coming from the neighbor's apartment. It's the sound of ME having sex from the night before. Yes this creepy pervert recorded ME having sex and thinks its funny to play it really loud through his computer speakers! I banged on his door to get him to stop and he yelled ""I recorded this from inside my apartment. It's totally legal"".   
  
So now for the past week every time I come home he plays it really loud so I can hear it. I called the police about it yesterday. They said they would send someone out to my apartment but no one ever came.

20,20,Is there a way my family can legally/forcibly obtain a portion of my brother’s ashes?,"My brother was diagnosed with an aggressive terminal illness and he passed five weeks later. The family wasn’t told until a week before he passed so we missed out on spending critical time with him. Not to mention that in that time he and his partner were busy making their plans without any care for the rest of us. My parent’s are very distraught over this entire situation. There will be no funeral, my brother was not buried but was cremated instead, and he had a will drawn up which excludes all of us even though he had no children and knows our parents are disabled. They also legally married right after he was diagnosed.

The money, the will, that’s one issue. But his partner is also refusing to share a portion of my brother’s ashes with us. My parents wanted a portion so that he may be “buried” with the family. They very much want a place to visit him now that he’s gone. His partner is being unreasonable and hiding behind saying it’s what my brother wanted.

I have told my parents we need to consult a lawyer, but they are grieving and feel there is nothing they can do over the situation. Is there anything we can do? We're getting railroaded into everything the partner wants...

Adding that we live in Texas."

23,23,Being harassed by neighbors for justified noise complaints (USA),"MA, USA. Single family - owned homes. 

Tonight 3 cops came to my home to inform me two families on my street reported me for harassment because I reported them for excessive noise and they let it slip that one of these families is claiming I’m targeting them for their race (which makes no sense because why would I be reporting the other family for the same thing if that was the case?)

How can I protect myself and my job? I have done nothing illegal or wrong and I just want these individuals to leave me alone and stop being so loud that I hear their nonstop noise from inside my house.

I told them I’m willing to have a mediated chat with the neighbors but if they aren’t willing to respect my needs too, I’m not backing down. Cops said they can’t set that up only Chief can. 

Backstory: I have neighbors who moved in about 8 months ago who have multiple children that play basketball in their driveway. This driveway is very close to my bedroom window in a neighborhood that used to be so quiet you could hear a pin drop. 

Even with my doors & windows closed & noise blocking curtains, I can hear the kids screeching til about 10 PM and the constant pounding of the basketball. The parents like to blast loud music and also play basketball. I regularly hear the kids saying racial slurs. It’s unpleasant. 

I tried to talk to them but the mom just ignored me. So I’ve reported them to the local PD every time I could hear them from within my home. The cops don’t do much except for the times it’s been the adults partying. They quiet down for a while and then start up again. 

I’ve probably called about 10 times over the span of 6 or 7 months because I wanted a record that I reported it in case I ever needed to escalate. It’s gotten to where I get panic attacks just being in my house from their noise. It sets off my anxiety to where I can barely function and the pounding of the basketballs triggers debilitating migraines. 

The guy next door to them, I called on once because he was having a loud party I could hear from within my house until all hours. This past weekend I called on that guy door again because he had a crazy loud party and was setting off illegal fireworks. 

The cops told me they can’t pinpoint where noise or fireworks are coming from, can’t do anything about it. They said there is no noise ordinance and kids will be kids. I tried to explain that I have a right to peaceful enjoyment of my home and I work from home and have health issues and they just said the kids will be kids. My response was “well the kids won’t but the parents should be willing to compromise”. 

They asked me several times what would be a reasonable time for quiet. I suggested 6 PM, they said no. I suggested 7 pm. No again. 8 pm, when I go to bed? No again. Why even ask me? 

I have purchased a decibel reader to get better record of how loud and obnoxious this is. I don’t understand why their right to be loud trumps my right to quiet enjoyment of my own home. Cops then suggested I host a projector movie party for the kids on my lawn. ?? No. 

The cops also informed both neighbors that I was the one reporting them despite my requesting them not to due to fear of retaliation. 

What are my rights here?"
24,24,Stealing Jewelry Insurance Paid For?,"Recently some friends invited me to go ""exploring"" with them thinking that we'd be exploring the woods and stuff along those lines but it turns out they wanted to explore old boarded up buildings. I don't want to go into too much detail but we ended up downtown which apparently has quite a bit of recent boarded buildings because of some really high profile riots and then semi-bad covid. We ended up in a jewelry store that looked like it had been ransacked as what glass was behind the wooden boards was broken pretty bad and a lot of the cases in the store were busted as well but the store was also cleaned out like the owner had left. I'm not sure if they were weak, lazy, or what it was but the cases on the floor weren't moved at all and we found a total of a small bit of jewelry under a couple of them. My friends took the jewelry and said that the stores insurance probably already paid for the jewelry that was reported stolen if the place was caught in the riots back then and even if it wasn't the owner obviously doesn't use the store anymore but I'm not sure if this is right or not. If this gets found out by them posting on insta or elsewhere can we get charged with stealing the jewelry even if we found it or what trouble would we be in?"
25,25,Could I successfully sue Speedway for this?,"Beginning of January I went into Speedway and an employee behind the counter verbally threatened me then came behind the corner to attack me saying he was going to “beat my as”. He didn’t attack me because his coworker held him back, but I did go to the police and he was arrested. After this incident I was told by the store’s supervisor I’m no longer allowed to come in the store if the gentleman in the store is there or his baby moms mom is there. I filed a complaint with speedways corporate office and after following up on the complaint I was told by corporate that I am able to go in the store no matter who is working, and to contact corporate if there are any further issues. Just today I went in there and the baby moms girlfriend of the gentleman who tried to attack me refused me service despite corporate saying this would no longer be an issue. Anyone who has had similar issues or dealt with these types of cases think I could have a successful civil lawsuit? The evidence I have is the camera footage of the gentleman trying to attack me and and the managers and coworkers at the location refusing me service despite what corporate has told them."
26,26,HELP!! Did I break the law?,"Edited for location: Arizona

A few months ago, my family was traveling in a car.  Myself, my wife, our at the time 17 yr old daughter, and our 6 & 7 year old children.  An argument broke out and everyone was screaming at everyone else (except the kids).  It never got physical.  Escalation continues until I start screaming at the 17 year old to ""Shut the fuck up"" because she is clearly out of line for cussing and screaming at her parents.  This is when the wife (driving) pulls over and leaves the car with the children.  I get in the driver seat and take off.  I over-steered my U-turn and hit a curb, jumped the median and destroyed my rim.  No pedestrians were around and there was no damage to any property other than my own.  As I'm changing my tire, a patrol car happens by and inquires if I need help, what happened, etc.  They interview the adults and then come back and arrest me for disorderly conduct.  Although I'm not sure exactly to what they are referring.

So I go to court and even though I don't believe I've done anything wrong, they offer to dismiss the case (1st offence ever) if I take anger management classes.  I accept as it seemed to be the fastest way through this whole thing.  Problem is, during my last pretrial conference, before I've had the chance to apply for council, the judge starts asking my all kinds of questions like why I was arrested and tells me that he may not honor the agreement unless I can prove that I've ""learned my lesson"". But I didn't do anything criminal!

I know my wife will not admit to anyone else screaming because she fears herself or our daughter getting charged with something, and the way this has gone so far, I don't blame her as that was all it took for them to arrest me.

​

Please help!  Should I throw out the plea and go to trial on principle?  Am I truly just ignorant of being on the wrong side of the law?!?"
27,27,"Might get kicked out of college for recording a harmless YouTube video, or so I thought. What do I do if it happens and what can I do?","Posting on behalf of my friend who is dealing with this issue and seeking an answer. Putting this on multiple places to see what everyone has to say so here’s what’s going on

My friend who is in college and has 2 years left till he graduates, He decided to start a motivational channel because he’s grown as a person and wants to help others around him that are like him and people in his community. He’s talked about dealing with social anxiety, getting in shape, dealing with relationships and other things of that nature. Hoping to reach out to people who were like him when he first started college

So up until last week he decided to take it up a notch and continue what he preaches and get out his comfort zone and go out there and do videos in public. I was the camera man in all of this and decided to help him out record. I do not attend the college by the way

Now if you ask me it’s the most generic stuff like pranks or social experiments and going out asking people questions, but truthfully it’s harmless. He just wanted to cater to the mainstream audience and grow. Now the video that caused this problem we made was “asking girls to rate themselves” with no catch. That’s all it was, us walking around his college campus and town asking not just girls but people in general what they rate themselves. Compared to other videos where people go around ask for body counts or more explicit things in public. We just asked people what they thought of themselves, We saw this as being harmless

We just walked around approaching people asking them if they wanted to be in the video and interviewed. And to those who said no, we just moved along and to those who said yes we recorded them and interview them. Everybody was fine.

We put it together and now we have the video ready and he puts it out and my friend promotes it on this app called yikyak which is used by college kids to talk about what’s going around town. And jeez when I saw the reaction to his video I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. I know it’s a stupid gossip app where people go and talk trash but I didn’t know it would lead to him being accused of sexual harassment and having to worry about getting kicked out of college 

He quickly became the talk of the town and people we criticizing and demonizing him. A lot of the people on there said that he was “sexually harassing” a lot of the girls on there and say he needs to be kicked out the college and taken down.

If you watch the video, these claims are absolutely disgusting, not here to promote the video just seeking answers.

At first we laughed this off. But due to influence a lot of the girls we’ve interviewed told the school and some want it taken down. For example. This girl in the thumbnail was perfectly fine being interviewed, even the next day at his job she passed by with her and her friends and chanted my friends YouTube channel slogan, then the next day she’s spamming people saying she wants it taken down. What sense does that make??

Now here’s where it the real questions come in. So the dean of the college wants to have a meeting with my friend in regards to his video and channel. The dean is known to power trip and threaten right away, he’s threaten to expel my friend from the college back then because he was still in the college dorm when everyone had to go home cause of the hurricanes, now that’s all fine. But he didn’t give a warning or anything just threaten to expel.

So when it comes down to it. What happens if the college kicks him out? What can he do? Can he pursue legal action? Does he have to take the video down? He knows that the college is private property but he attends the college and other students have recorded and token photos for other things, he’s already settled with not recording on the college campus anymore. But if the college kicks him out or makes him take down the video what can or should he do?"
28,28,I cashed a fraudulent check and now the bank is making me pay back all the money! (Ohio),"I was selling an item($800) on Craigslist and a buyer wanted to pay via check. He sent me a check in the mail but it was for much more than what the item was worth($3,000). He said it was a mistake that his assistant made and to wire me back $2000 and keep an extra $200 for my trouble and he would send a shipping company to come pick up my item. 

I cashed the check via mobile deposit so a teller didn't get to actually hold the check or anything but it cleared my bank in one business day and I wired him $2,000. He said he would be sending a shipping company out within the next couple days. I hadn't heard from him in a week so I thought the shipping company messed up, whatever. Then I get a call from my bank saying the check deposited bounced and they took the whole $3,000 back!

They informed me I got scammed via a check scam and there was nothing they could do. They said I'm responsible for paying them back when all I did was cash a check! How is it my fault that the bank cleared the entire amount of a $3,000 check without even verifying the funds?! This is insane!

29,29,(Las Vegas NV) Landlord posted bogus 5 day detainer on my door. What should I do?,"I rent out a bedroom in a house. Been here for less than a month. On the 13th, the LL taped a ""three-day notice to quit for nuisance, waste, assigning/subletting unlawful business, or drug violation"" to my door. She did not serve it properly and she entirely made up the complaint on the notice, claiming verbal abuse and violence and claiming she was afraid for her life (completely fabricated, plus she has a habit of entering my room whenever she feels like without giving notice, which irks me). 
Today, the 17th, (LESS than 3 judicial days later), she taped a ""five-day notice of unlawful detainer"" to my door. This one is also improperly served. 
I can't tell if she's crazy, trying to scam me out of my rent money, or just mean and bored. I've literally done nothing to warrant any of this.
She's doing essentially everything wrong as far as the paperwork goes. I feel harassed and would love to move just to get out of the situation but can't quite swing it at this time. What do you guys think, should I just ignore these notices? Should I sue HER? I interact with her as little as possible and mainly just use the room to sleep when I'm not out working.

Really appreciate advice here. I'm not too worried because I feel that she's behaving in a ridiculous manner, but I want to make sure the courts also see it that way. I don't think she's filed either of these notices so far with the courts in any fashion."

32,32,"Can guys legally get in trouble for ""whaling"" or ""hogging"" contests in college?","Wanted to ask this because ""whaling"" is a pretty common tradition at the University I attend. I live in Illinois.

For those unfamiliar, here is the urban dictionary definition of the word ""hogging""

> A competition, usually between a group of men that involves going to a bar/frat/house party. Participants go with the direct intention of hooking up with the fattest girl at the party. The guy who bags the fattest girl wins.

Its sort of a tradition in our school and there is a lot of money to be won. 

In our school, a group of guys organize the competition (30 guys normally) and each pitch in between $100-250 (need to pay up atleast $50 to enter but most do atleast $100) and the winner is judged the next day. You need a pic of the girl with you and a text message between the two confirming sex. Winner takes all the money. Guys have to choose between 5 parties/clubs (chosen before the contest begins) and must go there.  

Anyways, recently a lot of girls have been getting triggered by this and some are threatening legal action and reporting the University. So far nothing has happened but in the case that it does, can guys legally get in trouble for this? Also what are our rights if the Uni. decides to take action? Can they do that?

33,33,[CA] Girl lies to owner of local hobby store and now I'm banned?,"Hi. I'll try to keep this brief.

I usually spend my Fridays at a local hobby store playing D&D and MTG. Over the years I have been playing there, I got a crush on one of the employees, A. She has a boyfriend, R, but I felt like I had to say something or I'd regret it, so I did. 

She told me she was ""flattered"" but not interested. I'm not the type to give up, and my dad told me persistence pays off, so I started bringing her flowers every day. Both at her work and her apartment. (I didn't stalk her, She lives close to the store and I've seen her walk home a few times.)

She took me aside on Monday and told me that she felt it would be best if I dropped out of the D&D group she runs for the store. I asked her if she was also kicking R out of the group, she said no, claiming that I was harassing her. 

Tuesday I went in and complained to the store owner, telling him about the situation, and how it's unfair that she is kicking me for having feelings for her, but not her boyfriend. I told him how unprofessional it is to hang out with her boyfriend at work. The owner told me he'd ""investigate"" and asked for my phone number so he could get back to me.

This morning I got a phone call from him, that after speaking with A and the other employees, I'm 'harassing' her, and he's decided to ban me from the store. I tried to tell him they were lying to him but he hung up on me. 

I want to sue him for punishing me for something I didn't do. Is there a specific type of attorney that specializes in this? Does the fact that I'm black and the rest of them are white give me any grounds for a discrimination lawsuit?"

I have an employee named Bill (his names not Bill) and he works at a restaurant as a cook and waiter (it isn’t a restaurant and he isn’t a cook or waiter.) I manage the waitstaff and Paul manages the whole restaurant. 

Originally Bill was going to do 20 hours a week as a cook and 20 as a waiter. But then Paul decided that Bill was the only qualified cook we have and upped him to 40 hours in the kitchen. Because we don’t do overtime I am now not allowed to use him as a waiter, but I DESPERATELY need waiters, and bill really wants to do both. Now Bill is looking at working at another restaurant on weekends to work as a waiter, which is when I desperately need waiters. And we already pay way better than any restaurant in the area(he earns $20 per hour, everywhere else pays $15). So it would be better for Bill and for us, if he could work as much as he wants. But we aren’t allowed to give that much overtime, and our office manager says that it can’t be split into two jobs (I asked if we could higher him twice, once as a waiter and once as a cook.)

It just seems ridiculous to me that we are basically telling him to go work doing the exact same thing somewhere else, when we have those same exact shifts unfilled. Edit: and everywhere else pays less than we do. 

Any advice? We are in Maine USA.

Edit: Bill even asked if he could lie on his time card and roll the hours down the line until the end of the summer when he goes back to school, but we said no.

Edit: because some people are confused. Bill is looking at working 40hrs per week at $20 per hour with us, and then 20hrs per week at $15 per hour else where. I am trying to find a way for him to do that with us. Basically 60hrs per week at $20 per hour. We are not allowed to do salary. We are managed by an outside company. I want to keep Bill, just trying to find the best way to make it happen.

TLDR Edit again: basically this employee has two jobs and works 60 hrs per week in total. I want him to work all those hours for us and earn more per week than he does now. But I can’t because we aren’t allowed to schedule employees over 40per week."
35,35,Can a College Revoke My Degree 3 Years After I Graduate?[TX]-[CA],"I attended a prominent college in Texas with a decent reputation and ranking from which I graduated in 2014. During my time there I fell into a bad crowd and started suffering from numerous mental illnesses that led to me falling behind academically and being caught in a catch-up loop that prevented me from getting the grades I desired.

I'm now a graduate student in a PhD program in California which I got into on the basis of the diploma I obtained from the Texan university. Word of Mouth rumours have reached me that the semi-organized syndicate that I had obtained the work from has been busted and a lot of data files seized.

My main questions are, what are the chances that they will be able to identify my work as plagiarized?
If so can they revoke a degree 3 years later or is past the statue of limitations?
Can my graduate program kick me out based on the revoked degree?


I'm in a state of total panic right now as my life could be destroyed for no logical reason"
36,36,I’m a grad student and emailed executives at a large corporation a report I did on specific improvements they should make. I now see similar changes being implemented to what I recommended. What should I do?,"I realize that it’s entirely possible these are coincidences. I believe the company has around $6B in revenue, they’re publicly traded, and I was in contact with a VP. When I sent them my report in January, I asked for feedback, but all I got was a “thanks, I’ll take a look” and never heard from them again. 

I’m very active on LinkedIn for my job and have recently seen two things that have been implemented that I mentioned in my report. One of them was significantly changed but could have been inspired by my recommendation, and the other one is something I recommended based on what a competitor is doing. I don’t want to get more specific than that due to the industry and what these changes are. It would be really easy to figure out which company I’m talking about. 

Is this even worthy of a consultation since this isn’t anything more than suspicion at this point? I’m sure they have a big legal team advising them, but I never gave permission to use my intellectual property or signed any paperwork or anything. We barely even talked."
37,37,(TN) My defamation lawsuit against a disgruntled former employee was dismissed and now I have to pay attorney's fees. HELP!,"Title says it all. I'm in Tennessee and own a small bar/restaurant. I have a very disgruntled former server who created a massive tax liability for my business by accepting under the table paychecks. When this person quit, I demanded they sign a W-9 which they refused stating they were an employee and not an independent contractor even though they agreed to be paid under the table in the first place. I then gave them the option to pay back the payroll taxes that would've been withheld if they were an actual employee or accept a 1099. They again refused and began defaming my business on social media saying I had deliberately tried to misclassify them and that I was committing tax fraud. At first I tried reasoning with them with a cease & desist which they promptly posted on Instagram. When I tried filing a police report for harassment I was told it was a civil matter and not criminal. This individual then obtained the police bodycam footage of my report and posted that online. When I tried filing the second police report I was again told this was a civil matter even though my face is clearly visible in the videos they posted.

I filed a civil complaint in circuit court for defamation, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The employee then hired a slick attorney who filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that I was violating their right to free speech. The judge ruled the other party was in fact an employee and dismissed my case with prejudice meaning I can't sue them again. Personally I think there was a bit of judicial overreach as it's not a judges place to decide someone's employment status as thats a job exclusively for the IRS. What's worse, they expect me to pay for the other party's attorney fees even though I was the one being harassed and stalked. 

My attorney is relatively inexperienced and has never tried a case before an appeals court. As such, he does not feel comfortable representing me further in this matter. I've had consultations with other attorneys and the ones who will actually talk to me say I can expect to pay $10-20,000 just for the appeal and even then I could still lose and have to pay for their attorney's fees for the appeal as well. I'm considering representing myself, but I'm not sure what the process of that all entails so any advice would be super helpful. Meanwhile, the disgruntled employee is continuing to defame me and has now posted the order of dismissal online which has further affected my business. How is any of this even legal?"
38,38,I want to be able to see my son soon. Where do I start and how do I proceed?,"Some background before I begin.

A little after my high school graduation, I got this girl pregnant. We both graduated and were going off to our separate lives in a few weeks. I tried to convince her to get an abortion but she did not want to get one. 

Obviously, I was very worried. I was going to attend a big name university several states away and I could not afford to risk my career. I told my parents about this and they helped me solve the problem. I deleted all of my social media accounts, got a new number, and moved to my relative's house near the college I would attend. All of this was done pretty quickly (within a week).

I'd already finalized my college decisions and done everything I needed in regards to dorms and tuition so I was good.  

I've kept tabs on the girl through social media and she's been doing well. She did not get an abortion and our son seems to be doing fine. He looks incredibly similar to me so I'm not worried about the kid not being mine. He 100% is my son. My parents have also been keeping their own tabs on her and says both are doing well.

I'm graduating from college this year and my life seems to be set. I will be working with my father's company and i also made some great investments in the past four years (notably in cryptocurrency) so financially, I am very well off. 

I want to try and see my son and possibly try and get partial custody but I'm unsure how to approach this. My parents live int eh same state as them both so I won't be alone.

I'm not sure how I should approach this at all. Should I get a lawyer or will it not be necessary? What should I do first?

39,39,Can the police force someone to leave a public area for no reason?,"My friend was recently charged with criminal trespassing. There is an ongoing property dispute between her and the management at this location. She went to the leasing office of this condo complex to wait for a sheriff to arrive to file a report on the property, and the manager onsite instructed her to wait in the office. Then, the manager proceeded to call the police and reported her for trespassing. When the police arrived, they instructed her to leave and she refused to do so because she believed that she has the right to stay because 1) it's a public space that is inviting people to come in for business and 2) she is not causing any disturbance. She was arrested and charged with second-degree criminal trespassing.

State statute says:

**A.** A person commits criminal trespass in the second degree by knowingly entering or remaining unlawfully in or on any nonresidential structure or in any fenced commercial yard.

My question is, what constitutes as remaining unlawfully? Did the police have the right to ask her to leave or arrest her? I don't believe that a Walmart can ask a shopper that is not causing any trouble to leave the store for no apparent reason. If companies could do that, it could be used for all kinds of discrimination (such as restaurants in the past that didn't serve black customers).

What should my friend do? Any suggestion is appreciated."

I have spoken with every department and they all say that yes, it was their fault but I still need to pay them back. Is there anything I can do? Is this fraud?

41,41,Scammed Restaurant,Me and a friend used to do this scam a while back. Call a res-truant saying we ordered food that we never ordered and have it remade. So we would get free food. (super broke and could eat for free). But recently we did it again cause we both moved into a new city and were trying to try some food places for free. But one of the times I manager took one of our ids. and wrote the info down. Both we played it off like this was the wrong restraunt but he obliviously knew what was going on. We did not end up getting any food. But he does have our info. What if any would be the charge if he decided to call the cops? and if the cops did get involved what would my best action be?
42,42,What happens if you're forced to keep rescheduling court?,"Today I had a medical emergency shortly before I was supposed to go to court in Massachusetts for misdemeanor charges. So I called them and let them know what happened, and they rescheduled it.

Also what if the emergency is so bad that I can't notify them, until long after the date has passed?"
43,43,Can I be evicted for making too much noise?,"I'm renting an apartment and last night I had a small get together with a few friends. We mostly just hung out on my outdoor patio and things were going just fine until one of my friends took offense to something that was said. I honestly don't even know what was said, but she was drunk and it apparently pissed her off enough to go after the other girl who made the question in comment. Me and my friend had to hold back the girl from charging after the other and all hell broke loose.

The pissed off drunk girl stormed after the other girl and began smashing things around my apartment. Long story short, I made everyone leave, but the drunk girl kept pounding on my door and even tried climbing over my patio to get back into my apartment. Multiple neighbors were coming out to see what was going on and one of them was some lady who screamed that she was calling the cops. She also screamed at me that I'm always making a bunch of noise and she said that she was going to the leasing office about me.

I actually got a letter from the leasing office explaining that I'm an ""ongoing disturbance in the community"" and cited multiple neighbors complaining about me and my noise-making in the past few months. The letter also mentioned a potential eviction and removal from the grounds if these issues continue. I'll admit to hosting the occasional party and acting a bit loud every now and then, but last night's episode was only the second time that things got heated to the point of a near fight breaking out. But the point is that I'm a good tenant who pays all of my bills on time. They can't actually evict me just because of some noise, right? Is this a bluff?"

He took a picture and left after waiting 15 minutes. The owner of the car is going to a body shop for an estimate. They have already stated to my wife that we can just give them cash if we want. 

I know people in the auto industry that fix door dings for a living that would make it cheaper for me and the quality of the repair is as good as a body shop. 

If she declines letting a company I know and trust do the repair, what should be my next step? She now knows my son just started driving and this would pummel his already outrageous insurance rates.

46,46,Missouri - refund of microtransactions due to developer mistake,"I'm one of those 1% gamers who spends large amounts of money in games to save time and effort. This particular game is a player vs player mobile game, and your spending can directly influence your power in the game.

The developer accidentally released a game pack during a sale that contains thousands of dollars worth of upgrade materials. I did not purchase this pack as I was offline at the time, and they took the pack offline after a couple of hours when they realized the mistake.Upon taking the pack offline, they removed components that had not been used, but are allowing the people who used them to keep the upgrades. 

This has resulted in an unfair balance shift in the game between those who were not offered a chance to purchase this pack (or use the components) and those who did. If I spent another 3,000 to 5,000 dollars I could replicate the contents of the pack, but those who purchased and used it immediately before the developer was aware of the issue only spent 20 dollars. I have spoken with the developer and offered to pay the same amount for the same benefit and they have refused. I have also requested they roll back all the accounts who received the unfair advantage and they have refused, saying it is to difficult to revert the spent components.

At this point, I have spent over 20,000 on this game, and a broken pack and a 2 hour oversight on their part has removed a large portion of my accounts value. They have made it clear they have no intention to fix this. Google will not assist me as the charges were over 2 years, and they only refund up to 48 hours. 

As for my losses, there is my investment in my account that has had is value deceased. That can be measured by the money I spent to get account where it was (top 5% of accounts) or by it's resale value and the decrease in that value (I have had offers of 10,000 for my account as recent as 2 weeks ago. I have reached out to the same people and now they wouldn't pay over 2,000 due to this pack being released accidentally and the increase of strong accounts available for sale).

Is there anything I can do to get my money back at this point? The moment I issue a charge back they will ban my account, which I am fine with as I am done with it after they invalidated the time and money I spent on my account. My primary concern is I doubt my bank would issue charge backs for everything as there was no card fraud."
47,47,[TX] My roommate is suing me after I informed her of eviction for endangering the home,"Hello,

I have a live-in ""tenant."" Basically I own the house and I am letting her rent out a room. It's all verbal agreement and there is no lease, no documentation at all. Her address on her ID is still her parents' house.

She has decided to begin partaking in extremely dangerous and irresponsible activities that I do not want myself or my young children exposed to. We don't need to get into details but what she's doing will very likely lead to killing us just by her occupying the same space. I am not joking.

So she has left the house for the weekend to partake in these activities, she left this morning and will be back on Sunday night. After she left I had a repairman change out all the locks on the house. I then called to inform her that she is evicted and she can either hire a moving company to retrieve her belongings (while she does not enter the house) or she can wait two weeks and come get her belongings herself.

She is now saying she is going to sue me for ""wrongful eviction"" but there was no lease, no signed agreement, I am not a ""landlord"" and she is not a ""tenant."" She is just some person who was giving me some money each month and I let her stay in a room. That's it. I don't believe she has the rights that she is screaming about so much.

I am honestly starting to feel fearful for myself and my childrens' safety. I have recorded conversations of her screaming and yelling at me, and text proof too. Can I use this to get a restraining order from her?

Please help I am really scared and I don't want to get hurt."
48,48,"Can my employer (the Federal Government) require any employee (contractor or federal) to appear on video chat while working from a remote location, such as their home?","Over the last few months my supervisor has encouraged us to appear on video chat during our meetings, but has not yet mandated it.  I have declined to appear on video while teleworking.  I am in my home and no one from my place of work needs to be inside my home, unless they are invited.  Not only that, while at home, I choose to dress in a less than professional manner, BECAUSE I'M IN MY OWN HOME, so I would not want my peers, subordinates, or supervisors to see me.

My supervisor is very passive aggressive in her request.  I can tell that they would like to make video chat a requirement but suspect that they cannot legally require it.

My question is:  Can my employer (the Federal Government) require any employee (contractor or federal) to appear on video chat while working from a remote location, such as their home?

Location is Washington, D.C.

Edit:  I'd just like to say thank you to the 3 assholes that answered from their point of view as managers (and that clearly have never worked for the Federal Government) rather than as legal professionals and then downvoted my question so that no one else will see it.  You are truly the reason why Reddit is such a shitty place.

The fact is, if I am completing the work that is expected of me, I think it is unreasonable of my employer to think that they can barge into my home by way of video chat.  I had hoped that this question might spark a dialogue about other issues with telework, but that  doesn't seem to be the case."
49,49,[NE] 2 CCW charges 3 month period.,"Trying to help a friend, we can call him Nike 

Nike was dealing with a single CCW charge but is now dealing with 2 CCW charges +  a unlawful transport 

The first charge. He brought completely on himself, literally. There was a fight at his relatives house that was to big to break up. He called the police under a false name to come break up the fight. Nike didn’t like the cops response time (too long) as this fight got worst Nike decides to call the police again  and tell them there’s a gun involved. It was true it was Nikes Gun but in no way was it involved in this fight Nike attempted to take the gun to his car. Let’s be honest fighting and guns not a good combo,  Nike underestimated the response time of a gun call , within 30 seconds of hanging up Nike walks outside gun in his hand to put it in the car police are already shutting there squad doors and drawing there weapons, *IM NOT SPEAKING FOR ALL COPS* but today’s time nature of the call black man, black  hoodie with a gun in hand. Russian Roulette, Nike Pockets the gun first to avoid initial contact with 3 officers w/ gun in hand. First CCW 


Second CCW. Nikes leaving the gun range to meet with his GF to get house keys Nike gets to car window of GF and she questions Nike about a .45 caliber round. GF does Uber, Nike Debunked this blame by going to his car retrieving his .9m and comparing rounds. Little did anybody know US Marshall’s were 3 stories above in the apartment building attempting to locate a murder suspect and watching all this unfold they rush Nike detain him and radios local police to take over Nike overhears US Marshall’s say “we thought that was him actually”   Nike is wanting to fight this CCW charge because he didn’t  conceal the handgun this time it was clipped to his front pocket in a open carry style 

Nike is a good kid clean record finished school the whole 9 yards, there were some very impulsive, uneducated decisions being made *ALOT* of factors played into the thought process if you knew  why, you would know why Nike did what he did just looking for advice I could pass on to him"

53,53,DWS Klamath County Oregon,"I was pulled over because my turn indicator was out, and they sited me with a driving while suspended. The officers were super nice, even though he did ask to search the vehicle 3 times. Eventually he stopped asking when I looked him straight in the eyes and told him it would be a waste of time. I was clearly targeted. My van is older, grey, pretty run down. I just bought it, and hadn't had a chance to fix the body damage and paint it yet. That's what I do for a living I fix and flip cars. I am also permanently disabled through SSI. So I don't have much income, and definitely cannot afford a lawyer.  


It's $1000 for a lawyer, and I feel like I'm being pushed through a meat grinder. The guy in front of me in the trial where we enter a plea had terminal cancer, and they stuck him with a payment plan that I'm %100 sure he's never going to pay. He had all sorts of other tickets. Anyway they don't offer a court appointed attorney on violations, but they are threatening me with a warrant for my arrest if I don't drive the 5 hours down to Klamath on Oct 14th to come to trial at 5:15 PM.   


I don't know how they expect me to get there, and I'm really curious why I was never given the chance to have a suppression hearing, because I was using my hands signals, AND the police officer didn't use his turn indicator when he did a U-turn to come and follow me. I guess I'm held to a different standard of the law then a police officer?

&#x200B;

I've dealt with the courts before, and they don't care about me, or my situation, or my SOB story. I know they must deal with 100 a day. I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to avoid getting this violation or having to drive all the way to Klamath from Portland. With no Lawyer it seems like I'm in danger.  There is no way for me to know what they are going to charge me with, or fine me with, or if they are going to send me to jail for this. I really have no way to find out. I called around all morning and they withhold this kind of information from people for whatever reason.

&#x200B;

Because of my condition I am honestly waking up every morning terrified of what might happen. I barely sleep as it is with everything going on, and this is pushing my mental health over the edge. It may seem like a simple thing to most people, but for me the reason I have my mental illness is because of the court system/government. 

&#x200B;

I know I've said a lot of things that don't matter when it comes to matters of the law, but I'm trying to get some help here. I really need it badly. What are the next steps for me to take to handle this. I really need some help.

55,55,Can I sue my beekeeper neighbor?,"Every day i see my neighbor's bees flying around my garden stealing the pollen or nectar from my flowers. Then the bees go back to my neighbor and creates honey. My neighbor then harvests the honey and sells it at the farmers market for profit. I have never recieved so much as a jar of honey as compensation and everyday my neighbors bees trespass and steal my flowers. I was stung once when I was a child, so i know how dangerous bees can be. 

The way i see it, this is equivalent to a persons dog coming into my yard to steal balls or tools then gives it back to his owner who then sells it for profit. 

Do i have legal ground to sue? What type of things should I begin documenting in order to prepare for a legal battle? What would be a fair settlement amount if my neighbor doesnt want to take this to court? Thanks for the help."

I decided to talk with an attorney and just told him about the whole situation. He seems like a good lawyer but he told me that I will probably only get visitation for a while, if at all. I told him that I will try to reach out to my ex and then get back to him.

So I did. I tried searching for my ex's phone number but I couldn't find it. I decided to contact her via Facebook instead. I made an account and sent her a long apology telling her how sorry I was and how I was ready to make up for everything and be a dad. She did respond but she told me to fuck off. 

I sent her another message asking if he was my son (just wanted confirmation) and she told me that I was the ""sperm donor"" and not his father. I did ask if there was another man in the picture and she said no, so I won't have to worry about that.

After that, I asked if we could meet up in person or talk on the phone and she said no and told me to never contact her again and then stopped responding to my messages.

I'll be meeting with my lawyer tomorrow and will have him file for paternity and then go from there. My parents are also supportive of me reaching out and are helping me every step of the way, so that's great. "

60,60,(SC) My husband filed for divorce on December 1. He is disputing the paternity of almost 3 month old son even though he signed the birth certificate. Can I block him from disputing or getting a test?,
61,61,"Should I file for bankruptcy, and if so, when should I do it given my particular circumstance?","I’m 25 years old and currently owe $25K to IRS, $8K to a repossessed car, and $20K to student loans. I also have a couple collections I owe which have yet to be on my credit report; only letters at this point. The amount of the collections is $10K and $16K. 

My credit card debt is under control, as I currently only have like $100 owed on what is a $9K limit across three credit cards. 

I will be receiving a check for $100K in a few months from a workers compensation settlement, but with that I would like to form a corporation/LLC. I would put the entire $100K into the corporation. 

I am currently not working, receiving disability, as well as a variety of other low-income state and federal programs. 

Now for my **questions**

1) Should I file for bankruptcy? 

2) If I file for bankruptcy as an individual, should I do so before or after I form a corporation? 

3) Is there any way to protect the assets of a corporation through an individual bankruptcy; if so, what process?

4) What lawyer would I seek for this? 

5) Will I be able to keep my credit cards open still, as I love the cards I have, and have been on time, responsible, etc. 



I mainly want to file for bankruptcy *but* I want to do so in a way which will protect either an existing or a soon-to-be corporation and its assets (such as the $100K I’d put into said corporation)."
62,62,Generic Birth Control Caused Pregnancy,"My wife just started using  generic birth control and became pregnant immediately. We only hooked up once all month! And she doesn't miss a dose, no drinking, no other meds.

I thought generic was the same as name brand, and that's how it was presented by the doctor. The generic pill manufcturer also makes the name brand, and they don't seem to indicate there's a difference. But I found a gynocologist in NYC who states one of the top 5 reasons for pregnancy while on pill is generics and the FDA allows a 15% variance of ingrediants from generics, and with low dose pills this is a concern.  [https://www.healthinfi.com/chances-of-getting-pregnant-on-the-pill/](https://www.healthinfi.com/chances-of-getting-pregnant-on-the-pill/) 

Obviously I realize lots of people get pregnant on birth control. What I'm upset about is that the generic is sold as if its the same as name brand. Even the insurance company probably wouldn't have paid for name brand due to it costing 10X+ the generic. My question is - What kind of legal ground do we stand on? We already contacted a big name malpractice firm that seriosly considered but decided not to pursue due to cost of such a legal battle.

Adding insult to injury, my wife is not as young as she once was. She has had complications, bleeding, pain, headaches, bed rest. So in addition to the financial hardship this creates, there is pain and suffering. I am conviced the name brand could have avoided this. But who knows for sure. I feel like they could put sugar pills in the case and we still wouldn't be able to fight this goliath of a drug company in court. They can just say it's 99% effective while it might be 0% effective. How can someone really know? Any legal advice is appreciated."
63,63,Police served arrest warrant on girlfriend confinscated my laptop as evidence,"The police force entry to my home on O.R arrest warrant, handcuffed me and removed my girlfriend to police station for questioning.
Right from the start 2 officer's began searching my up stairs bedroom. Tried to question me but stated over and over that I'm vary private person and value my privacy. Asked if I was being detained am I free to go officer stated that i was being detained not free to go. I stated clearly that I do not concent to any searchs or seizures of my property. So here's the thing they found my laptop on the upstairs bed asked me if said computer was mine I replied yes. Officer's asked for proof that said laptop was infact mine and not my girlfriends. At the time I didn't have the reseat.
Officer said that I could prove that it's mine buy loging on with my password to let them have a look around. I replied that I'm vary private person and value my privacy so they confinscated it as evidence. My girlfriend never used my laptop infact I'm vary nosie person and made multiple iPhone backups of hers to Snoop around, crack her password and ripped open all the meta data from installed
Apps. A reasonable person would not believe that she would tolerate such an invasion of privacy. I'm worried that the backs not passworded would be used against her as she didn't give her phone passwords to the police.

64,64,My cousin lied about my nephew stealing her truck,"The situation is that my nephew went to my cousin's house and borrowed her truck while she was out of town. He got caught speeding on the highway and he was charged with speeding 75 km over the limit. Under the law here if you speed more then 50 km it is automatically a stunt driving charge as well. This means your car gets towed and impounded. The police called my cousin because it was her truck. She came home the next day and even though she knows my nephew she told them he stole it so she could get it out of the impound lot, because if the vehicle is a stolen one they have to give it back to the owner.

The thing is she knows my nephew but she's saying she never gave him permission to take her truck and he was never allowed to drive it and has never driven it ever before. His parents told her they would pay the impound fees for her but she still reported it as stolen because she didn't want to wait to get it back. Normally if you can't pay the fees you have to sign the vehicle ownership to over to the lot so they sell it to get their money and she said she didn't want to do this but his parents offered to pay. She also gave the police copy of the footage from the camera outside of her garage that shows him climbing through a window. So besides the speeding, stunt driving and theft charges he's being investigated for breaking and entering. He's never had trouble with the law and he was supposed to start college in less then 2 weeks. Her lie is going to ruin his whole future.

What can we do for him and to make the police believe her lie? She knows him afterall.

65,65,"Mom opened my mail, Called the police, and police confiscated my Research Chems!!!","I am 22 by the way

I know there are going to be comment's like why are you ordering RC's to your moms house but hear me out... I just want to know if what this police officer did was legal and if not what I can do about it.

Research chemicals are for ""RESEARCH PURPOSES"" and not human consumption. Research chemicals can be legally obtained on the surface web and there is no law against ordering them to do your own research. This is what I told my mom and the officer. What happened was my mother opened a package addressed to MY NAME and called the police saying that I was illegally ordering ""drugs"". The officer showed up and told me ""you shouldn't have this crap, your lucky im giving you a warning"" and he confiscated my research chemicals.

2 Questions I have..

So first off, its a federal offense and a felony to open someone else's mail as long as they are over 18 correct?

Second off how the hell is a police officer allowed to take something that I legally purchased with the intent of doing research , and then threatened to charge me if I didn't forfeit it over to him?

Yes I know it may be wrong to order certain things to my parent's residence without their permission but in terms of the law there are a LOT of crooked things going on here."
66,66,Court terminated my parental rights and gave custody to my sister. Any way I can fight this?,"My husband and I lost custody of our daughter to my sister. Our parental rights were terminated on the grounds of abandonment.

I left my daughter in care of my sister back in 2013. My husband was offered a job outside of country, but I did not want to take my daughter along because she has medical issues and had just started school. We had a guardianship agreement and we were supposed to come back to the US the following year. However, my husband's contract was extended so we stayed.

The custody battle started in 2016 when my sister tried to receive government aid for my daughter. I was ordered to pay child support, which I happily did. My sister wasn't satisfied with that and petition for custody again in 2018. They terminated our rights this year. They claimed we abandoned her because we had not seen her since 2013 and paying child support did not count as being a part of her life.

I really want my daughter back and we plan on coming back home to the US either later this year or early 2022 for certain. Is there any way I can regain custody of my daughter?

67,67,I can't allow my wife to get custody.,"Throwaway for safety even though she does not use Reddit.

Context: North Carolina, married 1 year, have a 1 year old child. She wants to go through this separation process and then divorce process without a court involved and very civilly. She wants me to help her move out with a smile on my face and be happy for her etc etc. I was blindsided by the divorce and have been rather devastated for the past months since the conversation was had.

Problem: Since the conversation she has been going out on the town every Friday-Saturday with her coworkers and coming home between 2-4 am. She typically goes from work to bar on Friday and then leaves in the afternoon on Saturday. One time she was ""too drunk"" and stayed the night at a friends coming home at one in the afternoon the following day hungover to the point where she spent five minutes with our son and then immediately took a four hour nap.

Tonight our son started choking. I don't know what, he was in the crib and hadn't swallowed bathwater/didn't have a bottle in the crib etc. I called her and was sent to voicemail and then followed with a text stating that there was a problem. This is my first child and I'm an only child with little to no baby experience, she also only has our son but claims she raised her siblings, naturally I thought she would have some sort of knowledge that I am unaware to.

The phone call was incredibly one-sided after she acknowledged and returned my call THREE hours later. The call went as follows:

/attitude/

""Hey, is everything okay?"" Her""It is now, i was really freaked out for a while."" Me""What happened?"" Her""X was choking"" Me""What was X choking on?"" Her""I don't know, he didn't have anything he could choke on... that's why I reached out to you. He stopped breathing and was turning blue"" Me""You're his father, I don't see why this involves me, can't I get just ONE night out with my friends?"" Her""Blah blah I'm upset she said she wasn't concerned with our son and is staying late and is now committing to a long night blah blah""

There's more but I feel it's less about our child and more about our awful relationship at that point.

She hasn't talked to legal advisers as far as I know - but she's planning on attempting to take a 72%-28% without talking to a lawyer and just moving out. I don't know if I can live with myself if this somehow happens... What do I do to prove she's a terrible person and unfit primary guardian?? Help?!?

I thought I would be all good to go and I wouldn't need to post again so I deleted the throwaway I used. Well, it turns out I have no self-control at all when it comes to money. Instead of waiting for my wife and I's divorce to be finalized, I went over to my mother's house and tried verifying the gems and seeing if I can get a cash value. I checked with quite a few verified sellers and jewelry shops and the entire stash is worthless. They are all either fakes, broken, or have little to no cash value. This is honestly the most disappointing thing in my life right now, apart from, maybe, my wife. 

It is what it is, I guess. My wife and I's divorce is going pretty well. I spoke with my wife about the divorce and thankfully, she wants one as well. We weren't getting a long and I cheated on her so its better to get a divorce before she finds out and tells our kids. Thanks for the advice everybody."
69,69,Do I have a case?,"A friend of 2 years who has flaunted & gloated about how much money he has (well off of $5 million) offered to give me $100k for my student loans and to help with my dad (who is currently being removed from his place of residence). I accepted this offer (in March). This friend then attempted 2 wire transfers, the first one was denied by the IRS with no explanation and the second one was taking too long. Then he claimed he mailed a cashier’s check that never arrived. Then he mailed another check in which I received the envelope just to find a blank piece of paper. I have his letter of intent with his bank information and the bank’s number as well as screenshots and pictures showing the wire transfers, the checks, and his bank balance. This friend ghosted me when confronted about the blank piece of paper. If I were to sue this friend for going back on his offer/ promise and for the emotional distress of waiting 
on this money for 2 months especially to help my dad who is currently in a crisis, do I have a solid case against him?"
70,70,"[FED] I'm about to bring an attorney a ""smoking gun"" as an expert witness in a multimillion dollar federal class action lawsuit. I have no idea how to get compensated.","Dear Legal Advice Community,

I am an anonymous engineer about to meet with a licensed attorney regarding a federal class action lawsuit he filed that I read about in the newspaper. It turns out that I am aware of a ""smoking gun"" flaw in the product he is not aware of, that may help affect the success of his multimillion dollar case. 

Not only that, but I have performed extensive legal research myself into the issue and how the ""smoking gun"" would affect legal cases such as his moving forward against other similar defendants. I have devised a theoretical legal doctrine that is very promising, and in fact, superior to the doctrine he based his current lawsuit on. I am not an attorney, but I am intellectually gifted and I am confident. 

However, one thing I am not is an experienced expert witness! I've never done this before, although I do have above average knowledge of how our legal system works. I would be grateful for your advice on this. 

Firstly, how much would a good ""expert witness"" get paid? I normally would get $100 an hour or so for my skill level of engineering. But I'm also bringing a smoking gun to prove the product is flawed and deadly dangerous to human life. Do I ask him to pay me now just for meeting with him the first time? Do I only get paid at trial time next year? Do I ask him for a percentage? I'm clueless.  

Also, how do I present to him my theoretical legal doctrine, without giving it away for free? It could literally be the basis of him making a career out of this. I.e. he could take a look at it, tell me I'm not an attorney, and shuffle me out the door, then simply use the White Paper I brought him. 

Pretty please with a cherry on top, I need help and advice with this. I know what I know, but I don't know shit about being an expert witness in a federal lawsuit(s). "
71,71,UPDATE I’m in highschool and money was stolen from my bank account. I need help NOW,"

Thouhgt I should give an update. Thanks everyone for the advice. I still felt like I should try going to the cops, but everytime I wanted to, I kept getting nervous and chickened out. That lasted about a day, then it turns out my dad looked got a call from the bank and he went absolutely apesh*t.


They stopped all the checks and took my checkbook away. I have no idea if they got the money back from my friends, my dad left for work for a week and he’s not talking to me.

I probably won’t see him for a while because I leave for my trip this week and I’ll be gone for a while. I’m only getting $300 for the trip this time instead of $1000, but I guess it makes sense that im punished somehow.

Biggest lesson learned: don’t mess around with a checkbook, or if you need to, make sure to write void on the checks.

Link to law
https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359-81903_20942-134114--,00.html

Even if it is a mistake, Walmart is obligated to the lowest marked price on the listing as well as an additional %10 of the difference as a bonus for the misrepresentation no less than $1 no greater than $5.

So according to law I was charged incorrectly. Walmart now owes me the 2607.37 charged plus an additional $5, then subtract the actual cost of $1.43. Roughly $2610 is owed back to me.

My question is, I contacted Walmart to let them know of the issue, Walmart told me that their Terms of Service is what they follow not the state law and this protects them.

So is walmart right? Do they trump state law?"
74,74,Is what this restaurant manager did/how he acted legal? (Indiana),"I took my siblings out to dinner tonight at a popular chain restaurant (it’s Australian themed) and when the check came I wrote check for the $83 bill. I was told that they don’t accept checks, which I found odd because it’s a major restaurant and a major form of payment, the manager came out and said that they don’t accept checks because checks can bounce, I explained to him that it isn’t like back in the day where checks took a week to clear, you can check if a check is going to bounce instantly, but beyond that I didn’t know what to tell him because I only had like $50 in cash on me for the tip and gas and other things and I don’t carry any cards, he said that I need to go and cash the check and come back and pay. I said alright (even though that’s ridiculous) he said that one of the kids should stay at the restaurant so he knows I won’t just not come back, I said absolutely not and that since he won’t accept my payment he will just have to trust me. We walked out to the car and I got the kids in and he and another guy stood behind my car so I couldn’t back out and yelled swear words at me and the kids, after like 5 minutes I revved the engine and started to pull out so he would jump out of the way and then I drove away, went and found a check cashing place, and came back and paid the bill. I was tempted to not come back after their disgusting behavior but I thought that would be a bad lesson for the kids. 


Is what happened, between not clearly posting that a common form of payment isn’t accepted, to trying to hold one of my siblings as collateral, to blocking my car in any way legal? I am not pursuing it but I want to know, I really hope not because that was all so ridiculous."

77,77,"30 Years Old, no criminal background, Wichita KS. Today I was put in cuffs and slammed against a window over an energy drink I didn't steal.","I went to a local Dillon's today (grocery owned by Kroger).  When I go shopping there, I tend to pick up a Monster Energy Drink and drink it while I shop.  I always pay for them.

When I grabbed one out of the store fridge today and opened it, I noticed it was flat and dented.  I threw it away in the trash can in store, and grabbed a new one.  I paid for the new one with my groceries on the way out.

A manager and (I could only assume, since his badge was backwards) a security guard stopped me just outside the doors, placing a hand on my shoulder and asking me to come back inside.  I did, when we got back in the store they pointed to a steel door and obscure staircase and told me to go up it.  I refused.

They told me that I damaged property and that it was stealing, I told them it was damaged when I picked it up and threw it away.  I apologized for not bringing it up to an associate, but they didn't care.  The (assumed) security guard kept telling me I needed to just ""come upstairs and make it right"" and told me I should pay for the drink.  Apparently my opening it meant I had damaged the already damaged product.

I refused to pay for it, refused to go upstairs, they told me they'd call the police if I didn't comply.  I sat by their ice chest telling them that I would wait until the police arrived.  While I waited, I called 911 and explained that I have extreme anxiety problems and asked that they inform the officers that I was stepping out for a cigar and attempting to calm down.

In the process of heading out, two officers came in the door.  They asked me to come back inside, and I did.  I explained that I was on the phone with 911, while one officer demanded that I go up the same stairs the security guard had indicated earlier.  I refused, and told the officer that they could take me to the police station, but I would not go up those stairs.  Now is a good time to mention that I'm on medication for bipolar disorder and severe anxiety.

As I was telling the officer that I would go to the police office, I felt one of them sliding a handcuff over my wrist behind my back.  No warning, no nothing.  I panicked and tried to turn to see what was happening, and an officer restrained me as they continued trying to put on the cuffs.

Edit - I remember that I did turn back and forth asking what they were doing, and trying to see.  I did try to remain calm after I realized there was no sense in struggling.

I settled down and waited, but then they started dragging me up the stairs again.  I panicked, and tried to back away.  I told them I wouldn't go up, but would go to the station.  I struggled hard, and one officer shoved me (face-first) against the store window while they checked the cuffs.  They tried again to drag me upstairs, and I guess I braced my foot on the door to try and stop.  It was terrifying, and by the time they got me upstairs I was nearly in tears.  They were telling me to comply, I was shouting that I would but I would not go up the stairs.

In the office upstairs, I argued with the officer that he couldn't do this and that it was assault.  I felt like it was.  I told him I wasn't under arrest and hadn't been read my rights, so it was wrong.  He told me that it wasn't assault, that I was under arrest, and that being in cuffs means that I'm under arrest. Once he said that, I did my best to settle.  I sat, calmly for the rest of the I don't know what to call it in the office after being told I was under arrest.

Inside I was at full panic.  I explained to someone that I had mental issues I am being medicated for, and suddenly everyone calmed down.  A high-ranking officer showed up to review the tape of the 'arrest' because of my screaming and flailing while being cuffed.  I'm guessing someone had called the police?

Anyway, I gave them all of my information, and told them my side of the story when asked.  The whole time choking back tears.  They told me they were giving me a ticket, but the aggressive officer and security guard kept talking to me.  ""You understand why we had to stop you.  You understand the stores reasoning?  I did tell you you were under arrest.""  The security guard repeatedly equated himself to the police telling me about how they did their jobs.

Finally they wrote me a ticket and said I could go, telling me about a court date next month.  Two important things, when I was being cuffed and cooperating (prior to being dragged upstairs) I called the security guard a ""small-dicked faggot.""  Not my brightest moment, but I'd better own up to it now.

Also, my left wrist and thumb are completely numb after the struggle.  I have cuts and impressions from the cuffs, but they adjusted them and made sure they fit after I told them about it.  I made sure the officer noted the complaint in his report.

What do I do?  I don't get in legal trouble, and I feel like I should just pay whatever ticket and move on, but I also don't think this is fair or right.  I feel like I've been wronged...  Have I?  Should I do anything?

79,79,hit and run case,"I was involved in a hit-and-run accident.  then a few minutes later  police caught me. they didn't see it. they just assumed it was me  because i was close and the person said the color and model of my car is  the same as the person that hit me. The police gave me a misdemeanor  charge for hit and run. they didn't ask for insurance or anything.  didn't even give me a ticket for no insurance. there's practically no  damage on my car at all, except a little scratch in the front. i hit her  in the parking lot going 5 miles an hour at most.  her insurance called  me today, asking to identify my insurance. i gave them nothing, saying  it wasn't me. they saying they got a police report.  anyways, what do  you think happens here? if i settle the criminal charge in court, which I  think i will. Do i still have to pay for damages? I don't think court  can screw me for no insurance anymore? The person can still sue me  correct? can i later just tell them i will pay for it without saying  anything about insurance? or do i settle payment in court? the court is  just criminal case i think.  whatever i have to pay is a separate  charge, but if i'm found not guilty, then she doesn't have much of a  case to sue me for damages correct?  I think they missed the no  insurance criminal charge, so they can't come back to that. However,  what happens with the person who is trying to get paid for damages? do  they ask me personally or sue me? I know they can still do a separate  civil case. Is it possible for me to settle later without giving  insurance info? Or will their claims agent not work with people  persoanlly?"
80,80,[California] Weird Question about age of consent,"No, not that kind of question. I have a 4 year old son who is going to be 5 in September. His birthday is early enough in the month it is before the cutoff and he would be able to start Kindergarten this year. If he did, he most likely would be the youngest student in his grade. My wife and I are currently debating whether or not to start him this year or to wait another year. He's a smaller little guy but has made friends with children that will be starting school this year. She would like to hold him back so that he doesn't have to be the smallest kid in class, but I would like him to go to school to be with his friends. However due to being a legaladvice lurker I have another worry about holding him back:  
If we hold him back now he will be 18 years old for his entire senior year. We live in a state where the age of consent is 18 and no Romeo and Juliet laws exist (perhaps there will be in 13 years, but that is unknown) I worry that if we don't start him at school now, that we are setting up liabilities that don't need to be there. Both my wife and I are were the nerdy sort that didn't really have overtly sexual relationships until college, and were both raised with the ""save sex till marriage"" message. While we don't really believe in that message completely, we do sort of both think kids shouldn't be having sex in high school and will be raising him with the same message. That being said, we aren't going to not tell him about sex, so there's a chance he'll engage in it anyway. I don't want him to get in a relationship with the wrong girl (or boy! Pretty sure he likes girls but you never know) whose parents are more conservative and get in a bad situation if they find out that something is going on.   
 I recognize that even if we let him go to school now he could end up in a relationship with a younger person, but he wouldn't be 18 till he was hopefully away in college and therefore less chance of being charged with statutory rape.  
  I wonder if I'm being over concerned about this, but I keep reading here about people strongly suggesting their 18 year old still in high school not touch any of their other classmates and people freaking out when they hear about an 18 year old in a relationship with a  15 year old(which is only senior-sophomore). This is really weird to me because I had many friends in high school who started dating girls who were freshmen when they were seniors. One of them kept the relationship up all through college and eventually married. Apparently their first time might have been the night of her senior prom. Another friend was seeing a freshman when she was a senior and she definitely came back and slept with him once after she started college. I don't really see her as some creepy predator, but  things seems to be handled differently 17 years ago. My own wife and I are 5 years apart (we of course met much later). Back when I was in high school if the cops rode up on 2 kids in a car and found them having sex, they would usually ID both of them and then send them home if everything looked consensual and they were both in highschool, maybe call the girls parents if the guy was 18. I think that now-a-days that if it showed one of them was over 18 mandatory reporting laws would kick in. And I don't even want to think about the sexting thing.  

**To boil it down my question is this: Will there be anymore liability if my son waits another year to start school, and thus be 18 for basically all of his senior year, or am I being overly concerned/ it doesn't matter he could still get in to deep trouble?**

What basically drove me over the edge with concern about this is something my boss's son recently went through. We had all heard that he had a run in with the law recently (which surprised us because he was a 4.0 gpa nerdy type kid) but didn't know what. Over the 4th we had a small company party and later in the day our boss got a little tipsy and gave us the lowdown. His son turned 18 in March, and in May went to a concert at a local 18+ club. He though he lost his phone at the concert, but it turns out that he got pick pocketed but the police had cought the guy for something else right outside the club because our boss got a call on the Monday after saying they had his son's phone and all he had to do was drive back out there and get it. Being a teenager his son didn't lock the phone and didn't try find my phone because he had turned it off for the concert. So my boss just told his son and he drove out to get it. My boss gets a call a couple hours later from his son who has been arrested. It turns out the police had gone through the phone to determine who it belonged to. I guess there were some racy texts between his son and his son's girlfriend (who is in the same grade but turns 18 in July) that mentioned she was in high school, and he also happened to have a bunch of nude pictures she sent him (that he was keeping with her knowledge and permission) And this piqued their interest and when he came to retrieve his phone they threw him in an interrogation room and got him to admit that he had the pics and that his girlfriend was still 17. Luckily my boss knew a guy who knew somebody that has been dealing teen sexting cases. Long story short, his son got off, but the poor girl got super embarrassed, her parents tried to file a restraining order against his son, and he may or may not have lost admission to the college he was going to be going to in the fall. What really struck me was my bosses description of the prosecutor. He said the guy would not be reasonable and was trying to throw the book at his son, threatening him with being a registered sex offender, molestation charges if they found out he had sex with the girlfriend after his 18th birthday, soliciting for the texts. My boss said he couldn't understand why this guy was going for such blood. The way my boss explained it was that his son only got off on a technicality. Sounded like something to do with the police not having any kind of warrant to search the phone and that they had no reason or permission to search the texts or pictures since there was clearly a contact labled ""DAD"" in his phone book. My boss and the lawyer had a very long talk with the son afterwards and explained how dangerous a situation he had set up for himself. "
81,81,"[NJ] Got my girlfriend and her family deported. I deeply regret it, help!","My girlfriend of three years and I had a falling through when she cheated on me with a close friend. It was a mutual friend that told me what was happening and after confronting the woman I was deeply in love with she admitted to the cheating. She admitted to doing it a year into a relationship and since she was very drunk (I was too, we got drunk before I brought it up) she was very honest about everything.

Well, I couldn't control my emotions and I spent a week snorting speed/drinking hard alcohol. I experienced amphetamine psychosis, took some xanax to take the edge off and while I was high I decided to call immigration services to report my illegal immigrant girlfriend as a way to get revenge. Last night, a month after this all happened, I've been informed that they're in deportation proceedings and that their house had been raided (as I also reported this neighbor (my girlfriend) was a heavy drug abuser. They found marijuana and LSD in the house so she's also facing jail time before they deport her.

I did not want this to happen and dont know what to do! I feel deeply guilty and regret acting on my emotions, I love this girl and it wasnt fair of me to be selfish. She did wrong but that didn't merit me ruining her and her family's life.

Is there anyway I can take back what I said? Cancel the charges? please help me, I cannot stand the reality of what I've done. "
82,82,Someone I follow on IG posted a story of himself driving 170 mph on the freeway. Can I report him?,"The person driving the car lives in Los Angelas, CA which is a different state from me. I screen recorded his video for proof, but his license plate is not in the video. I also don’t know his full legal name - just his last name. 

It boils my blood that he would drive at such high speeds with other people on the highway WHILE using one hand recording himself driving. You can clearly see where he is due to the highway signs, and his speedometer is also visible. It’s clear he was legitimately going a 170 mph based on not just the speedometer but also how fast he was passing other drivers, so there’s no way he can deny speeding. 

Is there anything I can do with the video to make sure he’s held accountable? He should not have a license, period."
83,83,"Neighbor gave my allergic child peanut butter. Who is responsible for the medical bills, suffering, etc? (TX)","My daughter (6) went to my friend/neighbor’s house with some kids from the neighborhood. At some point, the group of kids moved to a different neighbors house to swim. I know the parents at the first house well, but never met the parents at the second house.

My daughter is allergic to peanuts and wears a medic alert bracelet that explains as much. Regardless, the mother at the second house served peanut butter sandwiches for lunch.

After my daughter had an allergic reaction, my daughter told the mother about her allergy. The mother did not check the medic alert bracelet for instructions or for my phone number. She did not ask my daughter for my phone number or address Instead, she just called 911. No one came to find me.

By the time I found out what was happening, my daughter was already in an ambulance on her way to the hospital. The mom who called the ambulance did not even ask the EMTs which hospital they were heading to.

The medical bills are outrageous. I asked the mother who served my daughter peanut butter to cover the ambulance and ER bills and she flat out refused. 

Can I sue them for my medical bills? What about emotional distress? None of the other families in the neighborhood are willing to have my daughter over for a play date, which upsets her greatly. We may have to move, which will be very expensive."
84,84,Mother of my children has been saving all of paid child support,"(She is in PA, I’m in Florida.) So far I’ve been paying my ex child support for two years. Visiting my kids she told me that she has been saving up the child support to try and afford a better place to live. She also confided in me that she plans on using the child support for her upcoming car payment. I found this disturbing as my kids lacked summer clothes and she insisted I stock her place with groceries during my visit. To make matter 100X worse she allegedly got a dui. Her saving the child support is disgusting on its own but I’m afraid these funds might go to pay off this new legal matter she has on her hand. What should I do to protect myself and my kids."

Well anyway I tried to play it off as part of the joke but over the weekend it constantly bugged the crap out of me. I called out yesterday and today I don't even feel like showing up, it's bothering me THAT bad. I don't know if there's really even anything I can do and maybe I'm overreacting but I'm just so baffled how a company can be so immature about my name when I'm standing right fucking there.

I have a very minor criminal record with charges that don’t even exist in the United States for freedom of speech purposes, but I simply just don’t want to share my past, not because I have something to hide but because I am what I want to hide...

A law that was put in place in 2021 says if I haven't voted in any primary elections for the past 2 years then I'm not allowed to run for any kind of office in the state of Indiana.

I didn't realize it was someone else's until I deposited it and I was wondering if I had any legal obligation to send the money back. Ive been in contact with them and they've sent me two letters politely asking me to send back the money they sent me (they sent me an envelope with their address but didn't give me a stamp which I found annoying, since it was their fault and now its my problem), but basically Im just wondering if I have any legal obligation to pay them back. It was a one time payment so they cant deduct it from my future checks since I won't be getting any.

Edit: I know that since Im aware of it now, I cant claim that I was unaware of it after the fact. But im wondering if my lack of intent + the companies lack of giving me a reasonable way to pay them back (They didn't send me a stamp & demanded a check, which I do not have and have to now set that up with my bank) could be a way to avoid paying them back and avoid any type of liability"
90,90,6 driving under suspensions with 3 pending. Seeking advice,"Hello all and welcome to my post. Which of coarse you are able to see why I created…

 Six, count them SIX times I have been pulled over for driving without a license within the past decade. Please, before you leave, allow me to dig in to what I hope serves for good entertainment if not helpful advice on my end. 

TO BEGIN!!! I am 31 years old, a father of one but a father to three beautiful boys ages 15 12 and 4 months. Along with their STUNNING mother, they create what matter most to me in life. They have opened my eyes to behold a deeper meaning in life and allowed me the opportunity to grow and develop into the man I never thought I could be…Spoiler alert:I’m an ex-junky 🤪 prolly walked around looking like this half the time 

Yes folks, you heard it true, from the ripe budding age of 12 I began to experiment with narcotics and soon developed into full on addiction. From 12 years of age to 29 years of age I fought. Sometimes we’ll, sometimes poorly. Sometimes I won, sometimes I put myself right back where I started. Always as a result of my own decisions. The addiction had its say and still does to this day, but I no longer feed its punk self what it wants. I learned that it stays much much quieter when I feed it what it hates. Love. Commitment. Humility. Integrity. Compassion. 
Well, during my addiction, or rather a period of sobriety, I managed to put my life on track. Left prison and cleaned up. Started a landscaping and lawn care company and was on my way! On my way to a speeding ticket which I received for speeding 15 mikes over. It was Sunday, I was with my (then) lady, and we were garage sailing. Big hill. Cop at the bottom, we’ve all been there. So he pulls me over, I get a ticket, i go to the hearing and am found guilty. I get a letter in the mail requesting my presence for a special point hearing. I had 6 points on my license and had just gotten it back the previous year. The points examiner recommended I apply for a work license and pay a huge fee. I obliged. I owned a company which required me to drive, of coarse I paid it. Well they denied me and I never received the memo. Maybe they sent it, maybe they didn’t. Maybe the post office worked at it, who knows? All I know is that I received a driving under suspension in the mail a few months later after I applied for this employment license which I thought I got. Shouldn’t have thought. Anyway here comes another dus. And a short time later I relapse. Getting pulled over 4 additional times as I stopped paying my insurance registration etc, but still drove to get drugs. IDIOT. I swear y’all just typing this makes me furious at myself!!!

But I digress. Fast forward a few years and I meet the love of my life, TWICE! My beautiful wife and out beautiful son! Unfortunately for us, we already had reserved our love for drugs and soon both landed back in prison Kyle, back with his great grandparents. I felt pain like never before. I felt my heart wrench and tear in two at the thought of the depth and reach of my latest failure. We swore we would make a change, we swore this would never happen again, we both, individually hardened ourselves and then created a plan. And paroled out swinging! 

Myself in February of 2019 and her in May of the same year! 

Since we’ve been released we have ROCKED IT! We started in a tiny one bedroom apartment and now live in a beautiful 3 bedroom! Which we have filled with laughing young ones (and a moody but lovable teenage one). We regained custody of Amanda’s son and then took guardianship over his cousin whom is experiencing the same terrible childhood as Kyle suffered through. How could we not?? I tell ya, between those two and our newest member to the family, my life is about perfect!

EXCEPT THAT I DON’T HAVE A LICENSE. 

I was pulled over leaving work last November. Legal vehicle, ran my plate. Pulled me over. 

No big deal. Just be more safe right?
No option for public transportation. 
No family to give rides.
Uber?!? You must be kidding. I would have to work to pay my Uber bill. I’m not joking. 
The bottom line is that I searched for any way around continuing to drive. I couldn’t find any. 
I actually put my car up for a month and forced myself not to drive. 3 and a half weeks in my son got SICK SICK. I drove to the store where I paid in change for knock off medicine. I couldn’t even afford ginger ale to soothe his stomach. I had never felt so low in my life. I couldn’t pay our bills where I was currently working and it was the ONLY PLACE I COULD WALK TO. Had I not promised God and myself that I would never take what wasn’t mine again I would have robbed that store for every last think I could think of to make my boy feel better. My needs were increasing. Amanda was growing and our new born was coming. 

I hopped my ass back in that drivers seat! 

I then drove. And drove. And drove. And drove.

I drove to work. To therapy. To my psychologist. To baby appointments. To take my wife to work because she also does not have a license but is under dui suspension so can’t risk going straight to jail. To anywhere you can imagine a normal family of 5 plus kitties and doggies would REQUIRE to go. I created a NEW company and although we found no shortage of adversity, we powered through!! 
And then the last two weeks happened. 
Pulled over in after leaving our pediatrician. How could I have forgotten the inspection 😢 
Pulled over 4 days later on the way to work at 230 AM. Why the fuck is my tail light broken. 
Pulled over a few days later on my way to get the parts the car needed to take to the mechanic. And by a cop whom I have a history with from my hometown. How can this be happening, I’m so efed. 
And finally today. Regular Tuesday, I work 40 hours from Friday to Sunday and my wife works four tens Monday through Friday. We can’t afford childcare so we eliminated our need for it. We’re struggling but making it work and still so deeply in love that every day is a gift! Every struggle only a pending victory!! Our baby boy begins screaming. Bloody. Murder. I have never heard him sound like this and over the coarse of the next half hour watched his go back and forth from completely fine to blood curdling screams with tears. I finally got ahold of my wife and decided to go pick her up early and go to the dr. Our son has quieted some while in the car but was still crying loudly. Before I had left the house I had to make a decision. Drive my inspected truck which is horribly unsafe for my baby as it’s a single cab or drive the uninspected Honda and have my sons ride in the back to try and soothe the baby. And of coarse, I get pulled over for my inspection. 

Without going too much into detail, I’m losing it. I’m not losing my recovery, f that. I’m losing my mind. All I want to do is love and care and provide for my family and I’m fully aware I’m in the wrong. I still drove BUT WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!

Every time I get pulled over I explain my position to the officer. I’m honest. I don’t lie. And I always ask their advice. You want to know what I get? What absolute gems have been dropped on me? “Well, ya got to just get through it”
“Call your legislature”
“Why don’t you use public transport? No bus line? Uber then”
I have gotten a whole lot of “sorry that sucks” I don’t want sympathy, I want to not be sent to jail for striving every single day to improve myself and mt families position in life. My kids deserve so so so much more than I can give them but for the love of God I can’t even take one of them to the doctor without worrying I may be pulled over. It’s affects them and it’s so wrong.

91,91,Can I sue someone who lied to the police to get charges pressed against me?,"I'm sick of taking the high road and this has really ruined my life. I also want to know if I can press charges/sue the police but it's a rich town and I know that could come back around to bite me in the ass. I suffered a second psychotic breakdown (the woman in question caused the first one) due to the stress of the court case and became an alcoholic again.

92,92,Left handed class action?,"So I Know this seems kind of ridiculous to a lot of people and I'm not sure if I'm in the right place. I believe that left handed people are being systematically oppressed. Just for a quick example, All throughout high school there was one left handed desk in the entire building. In gym class I was always told to just learn it right handed. Left handedness has been linked with depression, higher suicide rates, schizophrenia and more. I just learned that the scientific term for it is 'non-righthandedness'. It is a fact that the majority of machinery and tools are made for right handed people and left handed equivalents are expensive, or unavailable altogether. I think that there's a lot more that we don't even think about that subconsciously teaches left handed people that they are wrong for being left handed. Would there be any case here or is this completely dismissible?

93,93,Prenup in New York,"I am set to marry my fiancee a year and a half from now.

At some point in the future, I will inherit <800 thousand dollars mostly in stock equities, two Airbnb's, and 7 rental properties with around 600 dollars in average net monthly income from each.

I mentioned that I wanted a prenup that ensures that my inheritances and my income from them remain separate during our marriage and that they would only pass down to my children if I die but she completely disagreed. I said that this means I won't be using any of my inheritance assets on joint purchases like a house but she didn't like that either.

Is there any other way to ensure that my inheritances and my income from them will remain separate and only pass down to my children without her agreeing to a prenup?

If not, I'm probably not going to marry her as I think it is completely unreasonable for her to disagree with something like this and I don't want to risk losing my dad's life's work."

95,95,"How do I [32M] as a manager deal with employee [38M] who wants to wear kilt in work, claiming ""cultural reasons"" and ""discrimination"" if I don't let him. Not sure what to do. What do you advise? [London, England]","I'm a manager, been in my new job for 3 months now. On Tuesday, Simon, one of the guys I work with, asked to talk to me in private.

I thought, oh, it's probably about hours, or other mundane stuff. But, no, itwas far worse.

He said to me thathe claimed he had the right to wear a kilt to work and bring bagpipes infor cultural reasons, said ""oh, but you let that Indian guy wear a turban on his head, and that woman wears a headcovering, but she's a Muslim, in't she? Surely I can wear a kilt and bagpipes with a dagger, then?"" He then said ""It's discrimination you not letting me wear this, besides, hoots mon, you' gotta let me do this to work.""

However, our official work regulations don't permit men to wear skirts, and I wonder if his grounds are flimsy, or if he's just making a point.

Me and Simon have clashed on other issues before, such as him chatting to guildmates on Worldofwarcraft online in work hours, from our computers, and I've also seen an employee (not Simon) putting his hand up a woman's skirt (which the woman actually wanted, CCTV evidence proved it, I believe she said ""Put ya hand up my skirt, you know you want to, it's hot, turns me on"". I actually was there at the time and saw it, was disgusted, but that was a year ago).

I feel like going to the boss about this, but don't know how to handle it, this is my first real management role (aside from, maybe, when I was a student, managing meetings, but then again, that was years ago when I was only 18).

The boss is the boss of the whole company, I'm the next one down the management chain, so to speak, it's just him, then me, and the employees, in our office.

96,96,Problem Male Employee wearing open toed shoes to work,"Hi guys.

I am the owner of a small company (30 people ish) and we don’t have an in house HR.

We have a problem male employee who has started wearing open toed shoes to work for whatever reason, I don’t know. But his feet are disgusting and it grosses people out.

We have a dress code for men and women. Women are allowed to wear open toed shoes so long as they are an appropriate color and design.

For men The requirement is closed toed shoes - period.

Yet this employee has decided to protest his imagined “gender discrimination” and his given reason for this is that he is too hot in our office and that his feet need to breath. Which is disgusting because he has nasty man feet with hair and discolored toenails and dead skin.

I have asked him three times now- first over the phone, second in person and third in email - but he refuses to change his mind and continues to wear the shoes. He is also going around telling employees that we can’t make him dress appropriately with shoes and that he has every legal right to wear them and if we fire him he will sue us.

I’m thinking that I can probably have building security deny him access to our office but I’m not sure it that is the best way to go about forcing him to step down off his ridiculous soapbox.

Does anyone have any advice or input here? Myself and the other female coworkers in particular are extremely grossed out by the sign of his feet and my female employees (about 85% of the company are women) are started to throw around the dreaded “hostile work environment” phrase.

98,98,Was I Sexually Harassed?,"21 year old male working as a pizza delivery driver in Vermont for a local business. 

&#x200B;

When I was hired at the end of this past summer to this job, a manager added me to a group text with all the other delivery drivers and the manager so that if people needed to have their shift covered they could ask in the group text. Yesterday, there were two drivers coordinating a shift switch and I asked them in the chat if they could take their conversation off the group chat and just message each other directly so that everyone's phones wouldn't keep going off. One of my coworkers sent a message in the group text that was directed at me that said ""can we have a rule where you you take your butt plug out and put it in your mouth for an hour or 2?"" (his grammar errors not mine). Someone else added a laugh emote to that message. The manager is still apart of this group text and I believe they can see these texts. So far the manager hasn't said anything to me or in the group text about this message. Today I sent a message in the group text that what he said to me was out of line and he replied that I should stop crying. He later sent me a personal message saying that he didn't mean what he said and was just goofing around.

100,100,"Ex said she's going to sue for slander, how worried should I be (nc)","I met this girl on an app in October. We went on a few dates and since then she's come to my place once a week or so and we hung out and all that. I was really into her but also really busy with school so I didn't have time to hang out with her as much as she wanted.

We were hanging out and she went to the bathroom and left her phone on the sofa. It buzzed and I looked at it and saw a text from another guy. I opened the message and screenshotted the conversation and sent it to myself. I wanted it as evidence for when I confronted her. When I did, she said we weren't exclusive so she could talk to whoever she wanted. I said she shouldn't be texting other guys in my house, it's disrespectful. She told me she didn't text him, he texted her and she couldn't control hen he texted her. She left and ignored all my texts and calls after.

I was really pissed about the whole thing. I was kind of blinded by my emotions and unthinkingly posted the screenshot on facebook and tagged her. In the post, she was referred to as a cheater. She untagged herself pretty quickly and the post was removed. However, I heard through a mutual friend that she may have lost a job offer at a political agency because of it, though I don't know if this is true. I lost a lot of friends over this post and a lot of people took her side. I'm pretty emotionally wrecked by the whole thing. I really liked her and thought we'd be good together, and now I not only lost her, but a bunch of people hate me.

Question: assume I moved overseas...tomorrow? Next week?  and moved to a small town in EU? Anywhere. What are the legal consequences of me leaving my child behind, unannounced. (US Citizen, able to get residency anywhere in EU).

\- The divorce process left me broke, with next nothing and assigned most of our assets to her, so I know he/she wont have trouble supporting him/herself and our child. I still intend to keep paying my child support obligations, but I am concerned that salaries in EU are far lower than in the US and I may not be able to pay the full amount, especially if now he/she will have 100% of the custody.

\- I  also know that most EU countries offer reciprocal child support enforcement laws that can be enforced upon their residents. How much are these treaties enforced?

\- Can he/she go to court and say I abandoned my child without notification and strip me of my rights to see him/her again till my child is 18 years old? Can he/she change his/her name, so I am unable to track him/her, once he/she is an adult?

\- If I do leave without obtaining a mutually agreed up on plan and court approved parenting plan beforehand, what are the legal ramifications?

\- Will I have rights to visitation? Even if I ""abandoned"" him/her? I understand the courts (and the world) would not look kindly on such action (and only the few who have been victims of NPD abuse, could understand)

\- Have other's done this? Is there a checklist of steps to take?

\- I don't know what else to ask, as I have just begun to consider this, but it is starting to seem as my only way out. What else should I take into account?  I do not want to break the law, and definitively do not want to be some sort of fugitive nor wanted by authorities.

\- Do I need to find a Saul Goodman?  A lawyer of his caliber? Anyone know of one? I need a bad ass lawyer to answer so many more questions I have.

I am scared and do not know what to do. I feel disgusted by even asking this question, but I must have it ready as an option.

TL;DR: NPD ex-spouse is going to eventually be successful getting me into fabricated legal trouble for her amusement and I am sensing that I may need to leave and be as far as I can from him/her as I can."
102,102,I hate my adult children. What can I do to draft a will that will be so convoluted they will have to fight one another in court after I die?,"I'm relatively wealthy (~$500K in savings and stock plus my house) but looking back on life, maybe I spent too much time at work and not enough time raising my sons properly. 

We do not get along at all. They are entitled, rude, and haven't made anything of themselves because they expect to inherit everything from me. 

I've had enough of them and I want to teach them a lesson after I die. Unfortunately I've talked to a couple lawyers and none of them have agreed to help me so I'm looking online. 

I want to create a will (or a couple of wills) so convoluted that my sons have to fight one another to inherit anything. 

My thoughts so far are that I prepare two wills and date them the same day. One will would give almost everything to one son, while the other will would give almost everything to the other son. I'd also tell one son about the will but then act really loopy and confused around the other so he would think I'm not in a right state of mind. 

My sons already don't like one another and I know they would fight each other to the death to get my money. What else can I do to make as expensive and difficult a challenge as possible? I'm in Illinois. "

104,104,I (25M) made 1.4 Million in stocks with my parents (51F and 49M) and now they don't want to share as promised. What do I do?,"Was referred here from r/relationship_advice

&#x200B;

Since a young age, I was highly interested in finances, making money and being successful in general. I would read books about those topics and watch a ton of videos on YouTube. After graduating from high school, I decided to join a private university in Germany and major in international business and marketing. Whilst my parents are doing financially fine because of our family business, they are not rich by any means. Nevertheless, they paid for my education in full and didn't hesitate to do so and support me, something I am genuinely grateful for.

Because the university is private and costly, a big part of the students were children of wealthy people in the city and had expensive cars and clothes (New Mercedes, Gucci, etc.). That made me kind of unhappy, that I wasn't a part of them, but also highly motivated me to do something about my personal financial situation even as a student. At the end of my first semester, I decided to start investing, as I already knew quite a bit about the topic. My plan was to expand my knowledge In a period of six months, and then invest my money that I had saved up by working in our family business.

Six months later, after many books, talks with professors and a lot of research, I still felt a bit uneasy but also capable and decided to pull the trigger and invest. I invested 7k (all my savings) in Tesla stock, this was around the beginning of Covid when the stocks had already plummeted. It was very existing and a special moment for me, but the best part was that shortly after investing that 7k, I started making money from it. The account was growing superfast, and I was on cloud nine.

That's when I decided to talk to my parents and ask them for a loan, so I could invest more money. I prepared a presentation and made everything super professional, as if I was applying for a CEO position and after our talk, they decided to lend me 10k. I accepted the money and put it in my account. Soon after, the money was rising again and they were pleased. Over the next months, my parents gave me 80k in separate installments for me to invest.

After the portfolio grew quite a bit, and the results were solid, we talked one more time, and they offered to give me 115k more (all of their savings). I invested the money.

Here is where the problems start: One of my mentors/ professors from my uni whom I am very close to knew what I was doing and was super proud of me. He would advise me on the topic and guide me through the processes, as he was an investor as well, and a wealthy guy. Early on, he advised me to be careful, as money can change people and the typical stuff you hear from rich guys...to simplify, he wanted me to have guidelines with my parents. Who does what and who gets how much after? Because they are my parents, I never did that. After they gave me the last installment of 115k and this huge responsibility, I started to feel that maybe I should talk to them. We scheduled an appointment, but my dad couldn't come, so my mom and I talked about my concerns. I told her that because I do all the work and the research (which is daily until now) and they provided the financials, we should split 50% for my parents and 50% for me. That's what my mentor advised me and honestly that's what, I felt, was fair too, since it is a lot of work on the daily and very, very stressful. My mom got very uncomfortable, but agreed to it. I told her that I don't want to fight with them in the future, as this was a blessing to the family and me too.

Since then, my account grew to 1.4mil before the Ukraine Russian war and is about 650k right now, slowly recovering.

Last night, things changed. I was at my parent's house, and we were discussing some family stuff and having a good time. My mom decided to drive me home, as my car was at the mechanic. During the drive, she was silent and not very talkative, which she usually is. I asked her if something was wrong, and she answered that all is fine. Literally 5 seconds later she asked me what my plans were with the money, when I decide to sell one day (plan to sell for around 4/5 mil). The moment I started talking about my plans (buying a home, nice car, new investments) she started laughing and telling me how there is no way I will be able to afford this stuff with my part of the money. When I asked her how much she thought I would get, her answer was 100k. I was shocked, but I assumed she was joking, and then she went on this rant of explaining to me how me, my sis and my brother would all get 100k each (my siblings had nothing to do with this and my sis also explicitly refused to be a part of the investing because it is so risky). My hearth dropped, and I felt played because of all this hard work and expectations for \*just\* this? After all, I am planing to sell at least at 4mil. We got into a fight and I asked her to stop the car and leave me in the middle of nowhere. From there I walked home a few kilometers in the dark and couldn't breathe all the way through. I was mad, sad, hysterical for a moment even...

Besides the fact that this is an accomplishment not many are proud of, and I achieved at such a young age, it has always been my dream to make a lot of money. Now all of that hard work and emotions over years for them to f me over? My mom did agree to splitting the money 50/50 early on, even though my dad was not a part of that conversation. She even guaranteed it. Moreover, there is no way I could ever look them in the eyes if they do that to me. We haven't talked since yesterday and I think a contestation will follow soon, but I don't know what to do...

Do I get a lawyer?? I don't want to sue my parents, but we also do not have a contract. Do I talk to them as an adult and try to understand them and find a resolution? Just swallow it? What do I do?

I can't talk to my mentor, as I feel like I will absolutely disappoint him with my decision to go against his experienced opinion.

Most important for me is my family of course, I don't want to fight with the over money or even lose them but definitely felt stabbed in the hearth yesterday.

Your suggestions are highly appreciated.

105,105,"Urgent help needed over incident today at a grocery store, involving Concealment/Shoplifting","Location: Walmart
State: Commonwealth of Virginia 
Charge: Larceny: Shoplifting <200 - Concealed Merchandise
Law section:18.2-103
Accused crime: Intent to shoplift

Story: 

Today at Wal-Mart, my S.O and myself were detained by 3 police officers including the Sheriff of our city. The reason being was Concealment. However, we were each under the belief that Shoplifting couldn't occur until you leave the store with unpaid items in your possession. 

We were within Walmart and had each concealed minor value items, my S.O putting her items in her purse while shopping with a cart and filling that up as well with good items, etc. 

Along our way we realized we were being watched very closely by a plainclothes loss prevention employee, who followed us so closely we thought we were going to get pickpocketed. We asked her multiple times who she was and what she was doing, and she just picked up the phone, ignoring us both. 

We overhead her on the call describing what each of us were wearing and what we were currently doing within the premise. We panicked, ditched all the concealed items,of which the plainclothes employee saw us do so. 

We then proceeded to walk out of the Walmart, only to be followed by her and one other male employee. As we were making our way to the car, a police officer rolled up directly in front of us and stopped, told us we were being detained, asked to search S.O's purse,found no valuables, asked to search myself, I denied the search and they continued on. 

Cited us each with ""probable cause"" even without viewing the security cameras. Was literally the plainclothes employee word vs our own, and I made sure to let the cops know that the employee never made it known who she was. I told the police officers that it caused us fear because she could have been describing us to a assailant to then have us robbed within the store or in the parking lot. He asked me if she ever stated who she was btw.

It was a dumb mistake, and we never had intent of taking anything outside the store. We were taking her elderly godmother shopping and wanted to surprise her with gifts, so we concealed her presents by hiding them on our persons and in a purse. 

To make matters worse, my S.O is currently at the end of her probation status and if she catches a charge now, it's pretty much game over for her freedom right now. We feel remorseful and know that we shouldn't have, but never intended to steal and thought that in our panic to evade the creeper of a Loss Prevention employee, that ditching the items and leaving would set us in the clear. 

Had no clue about this law, sounds like a bullshit bogus one. We will be contacting criminal attorneys tmrw(S.O has already contacted her family lawyers after the incident), but in the meantime am trying to figure out a way out, or to get the cases thrown out. Since legally, technically, no actual Shoplifting was committed. They just believe we had intent to shoplift. 

Tldr: both of us got bs misdemeanor ""Concealing merchandise"" in Walmart today. Banned from that walmart,had to sign trespassing papers. Commonwealth of VA, no items were actually ever stolen, and it was written up under ""General District Court (Traffic), if that matters at all. 

Any help would be seriously appreciated. Thank you"
106,106,Got caught at target in USA,"My girlfriend got caught stealing from target, she skipped scanning an item and was confronted by 2 security personnel. She was entirely compliant with everything and even let them search her purse for any other merchandise (she paid for a total of about $50 items and skipped a $10 item) which they didn’t find anything. The security folks decided to give her a break and just banned her from the store for a year, and didn’t call the police. She’s done it once or twice before with items under $10 and hasn’t been caught. She realizes she made a mistake and is probably never going back to any target ever again. She has severe anxiety and is convinced she’s going to be arrested later and charged. Are they going to investigate her further or anything?"

108,108,My brothers Ex-wife not changing her last name back and she has a child that isnt his,"In the divorce agreement it stated she had to change it back to her maiden name. It’s been 3 years and she still hasn’t. We found out that she has a child and the father isn’t in the picture so the child’s legal last name is ours. Well our last name isn’t a very common one or at least the way it’s spelled isn’t. My brother is just done at this point and doesn’t want to deal with it. Is there anyway that I could sue her to make her change her and the baby’s last name?

Edit: my main concern isn’t with her having the last name it’s her child and any future possible children she may have having the last name, she is the exact type of person to try and sue us over some stupid bullshit involving the child’s last name being the same as ours. She’s already tried to sue my brother over something which was later thrown out. Idk what he won’t talk about it."
109,109,We've all joked about it... Jump in the way of a car so you can sue... LOL.. not.,"This has actually happened to me. Except for the part where this woman wasn't even hit.

This whole case has been insane. My life as a very young adult is up in flames, my leasing agent even went as far as to call me ""a baby"". I've even lost my apartment over this, only being given three days to move out. I know we've all joked about it, file a lawsuit after an injury from a vehicular accident. Well someone is pressing me with third degree criminal charges over this exact scenario and I'm now fighting for my life. About a month ago I parked in a car port spot at my complex, not mine, only meaning to be there for two hours. By the time I came out with my friend this woman threatened to have me arrested, towed, thrown in jail, etc. all the while swearing and yelling. She stood on the opposite side of the car port from where I parked and was entering my vehicle. I told her, ""Look I've never seen anyone park here, you don't have to be so rude and I hope your day gets better b\*tch"". I reversed and left as WE watched her walk away.

Two days later I'm called into the police department to make a statement and the Detective told me she wanted an apology and for me to pay her medical bills, taking her side claiming I hit her causing a sprained ankle and swollen knees. I've actually found out since then, that she had these injuries two months ago from a workplace injury. She had gotten a lawyer, changed her mind and wants to press charges. My apartment complex received word from the police department and decided to give me a three day notice to quit. Keep in mind I haven't been officially charged or even been to court yet, this is all done on hearsay. The injuries had also escalated to a broken foot and sprains in both knees. 

So now I'm technically homeless and get this. I was mailed from the court's office a notice that my hearing date had changed but because I was evicted I don't have access to my mail, so I would have never known this and potentially had a warrant out for my arrest because of this. The only way I found out was also a joke as I've been trying to get a public pretender which is near impossible to do especially if you are employed. Remember I'm a young adult, homeless have $0.22 to my name and I'm on an LOA from work due to the extreme stress this whole thing has caused. She's also claiming to have someone whom saw me hit her.

Our justice system is broken. If anyone has any advice on the matter, please let me know, I need all the help I can get right now. I've tried to see if this has actually happened to anyone else and it honestly doesn't seem like it has."

111,111,"[New York, NY] Against my express consent, parents insist on leaving 100s of thousands, if not millions of dollars to my 4 year old in a trust","My parents set up a trust for my daughter against my express wishes. I don’t know what the terms are. They refused to make me the trustee. I shared with them my concerns that my daughter is only 4 years old, and I have no idea what kind of person she may be when she gets older and that I’m uncomfortable with her being given large sums of money without my permission and/or involvement. This isn’t chump change. My parents are dumping sums to the tune of 100s of thousands of dollars per year in this trust for her. In the end it will hold well over a million dollars, if not several million, and possibly some real estate, as well, although they say that will be left to me and my brother. 

They agreed to not tell her about the trust until she’s “older”, but that doesn’t bring me any comfort because A. I don’t trust they’ll keep their word. They’re narcissistic and will want to be “thanked” at some point and B. It still doesn’t answer the question of what kind of things she may spend the money on that may get her into trouble, or simply be wasteful. Frankly, I’m terrified. We’re talking about a hypothetical adult who is still a toddler here! I also don’t like that they’re going over my head and giving what should be my carefully considered and loving parenting decision over to a perfect stranger who will exercise his judgement against whatever it is my daughter might eventually ask for the money for without even knowing her. I’m her mother, not my parents, and not some random trustee. That and other family dynamics are really neither here nor there. 

I want to know if there’s any action I can bring to dissolve this trust, or clauses (what-have-you) that I can impose that can make the execution/distribution of the trust contingent upon certain things as the parent to this now-child and the adult she will grow to be. 

Edit: I understand (grudgingly) that’s there’s nothing I can do about when she’s an adult and wants to access the trust, but can I have any control over when she discovers there is a trust? My parents have already verbally agreed to let me decide when to disclose it’s existence, but as I said above, I don’t trust that they’ll do that. Is there any kind of legally binding agreement I can write up to make them keep their word? This sounds ridiculous even to me, but there must be a way to work this angle?"

113,113,My (22) ex girlfriend (20) just filed an abuse protection order on me. I have never been violent towards her or threatened her with violence. Do I have a chance to prove it’s unnecessary or is it almost a sure thing that she’ll get it? Thanks in advance.,"Okay I really need some help. I also apologize in advance for the length. I tried to put as much information as I could. So my ex and I have been on and off since October when she cheated on me. I broke up with her when it happened but still gave her the opportunity to explain herself and say what she had to say. I was devastated because I seriously loved the heck out of this girl and never felt like that with anyone else before. So a little time passes and I forgive her and we give things another go. Except right after the first time we slept together again she found out she had herpes and confronted the guy she cheated with and he denied having it. So of course she questions me and I never had symptoms or anything but still went to the doctors and had to explain everything which was terrible but the doctor told me if I never had any symptoms before it was highly unlikely from me. But still I had guilt and felt like I had given it to her. Except the guy finally admitted to it after saying he’d go and get checked. 

She had originally met the guy at school orientation I believe because they were both orientation leaders and they spent two consecutive weeks together and she broke up with me late June of last year when she went for it. Then a week after she gets back home she breaks up with him and comes back to me. So things were great from then on until October, until she cheated. We got past it and fast forward to June of this year when she has to go back again. She started acting very distant and she sent me 3 snapchats with him in them her very first day which just made me feel terrible. I told her that if she was planning to do the same thing she did last year then just be straight up with me and tell me if she’s talking to him behind my back so I can walk away before I get too reinvested again since she had just broken up with me and gotten back just weeks before. 

I dealt with super heavy depression every time she broke up with me and it was like every time I started to find my happiness without her again she’d come back and tell me how much she loved me. So she was telling me that it was nothing and I had nothing to worry about but it was like 9pm and she said she was playing a game with the other leaders and she was “so sorry and would text me in a few” so I waited up for hours but I had work at 6 so I fell asleep. I woke up to see her with a bunch of texts a little after midnight talking about I should be trying to pull her harder and she shouldn’t even be talking to me after all the times I’ve hurt her feelings. She said I shouldn’t be able to tell her not to talk to that guy and I was being controlling for saying that even though I just told her it was either me or him pretty much. So when I woke up at like 4:50am still half asleep I got super emotional and sent her a bunch of texts talking about how she has no idea what it’s like to be hurt considering how depressed I was and wanted to end things for myself at one point which I know is not the answer but I can’t explain how I felt during those times and just wanted it to stop. 

So this is where I fucked up. About a month before I had known a certain family member had kept what I remembered to be a gun in their closet and I was at a low point and grabbed the gun and just sat there crying. I talked myself out of it and really told myself that I had to figure it out because I knew I wanted to live I just wanted the pain to stop. So I took a picture of it so I could remind myself later on in life when I was truly happy and just be thankful that I never did anything. Here’s my biggest mistake, I sent the picture to her just because she tries saying that when I tell her I struggle with that she thinks I’m just lying and trying to manipulate her which I’ve never lied about anything to her. So she didn’t take it well when she woke up and responded because she just started telling me that I was being abusive by sending that and she told her dad and he called me while I was at work and left me a voicemail saying we needed to talk. I started having terrible anxiety at work and I asked my ex/girlfriend why she told her dad and she said  I sent her a pic of a gun so she had to. Then she said she didn’t like me anymore and it was over. I just apologized and tried explaining to her that in no way, shape or form was that meant to hurt, manipulate, scare, threaten her or anything at all. It was me trying to get her to understand what I’ve been through and how badly I’ve been hurting and I still always let her back into my heart after it. She never answered my apologies and I left it at that. 

I think a week later goes by and I see that she was looking at my social media stuff so I sent her a message just telling her how sorry I was again and how much she meant to me and I know I make mistakes but I’ve always been good to her. She told me to leave her alone and she didn’t want to be in a relationship or be friends with me at all. So I asked her if it was because of the picture or something before and she said it was the picture. I just told her how sorry I was again and then I checked out her page and I saw that she had posted a picture of the kid she cheated with only two days after that night and tagged him so I messaged him and honestly did lose my temper and don’t even remember exactly what I said but I definitely told him I wanted to fuck him up and he’s a piece of shit for giving her herpes and I should have talked to him way sooner. I said like let’s meet up sooner than later or something Idek. It takes a lot for me to get angry and lose my cool like that but I was so pissed that I never even called him out months ago and then he came back and was talking to her again. 

So then I messed up again and made an instagram account named “_____WithTheHerpes” and the bio said his school name with his first name and just last initial. I also wrote “I like to sleep with guy’s girlfriends and give the gift that keeps on giving. Yes I have herpes” and I put a generic photo from the internet of a herpes outbreak. Then followed random people from the school including him. So I got a text from her saying “take down that fake profile of _____. If not then I’m going to take this to the police.” I said why so you can be all over Instagram together posting pics and you don’t want people to know the truth? So she blocked me and her dad texted me telling me I was not welcomed anymore at all and they had already sent screenshots of the gun and the Instagram profile to the police and a restraining order was coming my way asap. I responded when the page was down and said please don’t do that because I don’t want anything on my record especially because I graduate this fall and will be applying for jobs. I said I’d never contact his daughter again and I was sorry for everything. The next day I get a call from the police while I was at work to come into the station or they would come to my job or house. I said I would come as soon as I got out of work and I got served an abuse prevention order. I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. 

The court date is one week and I’m scared to talk to my parents or anyone about it for that matter. I have never ever ever threatened or laid a finger on her. Never have I ever thought about and I never would no matter what. Even when she told me she had herpes I was nothing but supporting and told her that it didn’t change who she was and even if I couldn’t be with her again romantically I’d always be there for her with anything. So I’m terrified of what’s to come and don’t know how to prepare for court or if I should get a lawyer or if I should could just prove to the judge that i am no threat to her whatsoever. I have no issue bringing in full pictures of text conversations with context of everything. I in no way threatened her and literally explained right when I sent the picture that I was depressed and wanted to end it for myself. Do I honestly need a lawyer for this? The officers said that things like this happen all the time and I really don’t think that there’s anything that she could say that would make the judge think I’m a threat to her. 


tldr; my ex who cheated on me, got herpes and put me through emotional hell with on and off breakups, started to repeat her past tendencies and I told her how badly it’s hurt me and made me depressed and wanting to end my life. I sent her a picture of the gun I had in my hands at one point which actually turned out to be a very real looking BB gun but explained that it had nothing to do with her directly and just some suicidal thoughts I had. I literally told her if she planned on talking to the same guy that did this to us then I just be straightforward and tell me before I let my guard down and fall back into depression. She tells me she doesn’t want anything to do with me and I just apologized and left it at that for a week. Then I messaged her apologizing again and telling her how much I missed her but she said she didn’t want to be friends or anything anymore. So I messaged that guy and went off on him saying how I was gonna fuck him him up and I should’ve a long time ago. And he’s a piece of shit for everything he’s done. Then I made a fake page called “____WithTheHerpes” but never used his photo or full name. And said “I like to sleep with guy’s girlfriends and give the gift that keeps going. Yes I have herpes” then her dad texted me telling me they sent screenshots of everything to the police and a restraining order is coming. Which they really did file and the hearing is in a week. Do I have any chance of proving to the judge that it’s unnecessary for an abuse protection order and I don’t pose a threat to her or anyone else? I just want this all to be over at this point. I should have moved on a while ago."
114,114,Am I going to get arrested for unlawful imprisonment? [AR],"I currently am employed as a receptionist at a pregnancy clinic.

Basically, when a woman comes to our clinic, the nurses give her a free pregnancy test and discuss her options. The goal is to advocate for adoption or raising the baby and to provide free resources for the women who agree to one of the two options.

One woman became extremely agitated after beginning her appointment. She started screaming ""IM GOING TO GET AN ABORTION"" so loud that I could hear it at the front desk. The nurse left the woman alone in the room to calm down. The door was locked and the woman tried to open it in her rampage. When it wouldn't open, she called 911. 

The police came in and had us open the door. I asked them to escort the woman out which they did. One of the cops came back in and told me that what ""we"" (I was NOT the one who locked the door) committed unlawful imprisonment and should hear from the police in the next few days.

I want to emphasize that the nurses and I followed company policy to a T through this entire situation. Did we commit a crime, or if a crime was committed, is it the fault of the business? Are any of us liable or is it the business owner? Again, we were following company policy. Thank you."

When I asked why she began to harass me about not revealing i'm a ""tranny"" (her words.) While yes, I didn't reveal to her that I was trans, I really didn't think it mattered. I've already transitioned so most people don't care. Well, apparently she did because she left immediately and I haven't seen her since.

SO, to make a long story short she is now pressing charges on me for sexual assault. Her claim is I lied, manipulated, and pressured her into sex and that because she didn't know all the ""facts"" she could not have connected.Along with this, she is now telling all of out mutual friends that I lie to people about who I am to get sex. This is negatively affecting me as I have received some awful messages from people and am not welcome to a lot of places i used to go

Is there anything I can do? I'm meeting with a lawyer tomorrow but I want to know what my options are here going in. Can I sue her for slander and maybe counter sue for false charges? thanks in advance. 

Edit:
I'm not getting any more helpful advice and sexist, homophobic, transphobic cis trolls are starting to file in so I'm gonna leave. thanks to those who aren't 4chan trolls who only hate me because i'm trans  "
116,116,I am thinking about using service to create job references so I can get a better paying job. What would happen if I get caught?,"I have autism. I have several real degrees, mostly from legitimate online colleges like the University of Phoenix and smaller state schools near where I live.

I have an MBA, a few masters degrees and a BS in a STEM subject.

I’m stuck at minimum wage factory jobs with no hope of advancing.

To get good paying jobs I need experience but I can’t get that experience because all jobs even entry level positions what experience.

I was thinking of using services that would create that experience: things like CareerExcuse, or the reference shop/store

Would these services work? What are the legal implications for using such services? I know it’s morally wrong, but I’m sick of being stuck at minimum wage jobs with no way out, I just wanted to make sure that I couldn’t go to jail for using such services.

Bare in mind that I have legitimate degrees so I’m not asking about buying a fake degree to do a job I don’t know how to do, I’m asking about buying fake experience so I can get a job I already learned how to do in college.

What are the odds of getting caught? Would these job reference services work, or are they scams?

If it did work out and got the job and did good at it, what is the likelihood I’d get discovered and/or fired over it.

After I use the service how long would I need to worry about my ruse being discovered. Bare in mind all the education on my resume will be real, it’s just the previous job experience will be created by a service that created job experience and references and not by working at an actual job.

Is their any legitimate way for a person with autism and poor social skills to get a job w/o needing to buy experience because I can’t seem to find one.

I just want answered about the legal aspects of doing this not the moral or ethical aspects because I stopped caring about morals and ethics along time ago. I just want to make sure that it is not a felony or other legal offense to use these services to land a good paying job."
117,117,Scammed a Scammer Now He's Threatening to Alert the FBI,"There's a scammer that recently sent me $1000. I blocked him shortly after he sent me the check which I then deposited into my account. I was supposed to send him half of the money back but none of my accounts were working. Plus all of his accounts had different names, even his instagram handle and username had different names. For example, his Cashapp was Bri, Gmail was Paula, and I believe one of his Instagram names was Brandon. Anyways, he emailed me (my business email is in my bio) and is threatening legal action since I took his money. I think I have a pretty fair case if this does happen since he was the one to send me the money and he has a very dubious internet presence. My only issue is I told him I would pay him back which could be used as a contractual agreement in court. In the case of legal action to I have a good case or should I be more concerned?

&#x200B;

Also he did threaten to contact the FBI, but there is a family friend of ours who is an FBI agent. Should I ask him about this as well?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just got off the phone with my bank and informed them that the check I cashed may be fraudulent. The representative said it wasn't or else the sensors would have picked it up or he would notice since he was looking at it. Either I'm lucky or they are wrong, either way I won't be spending the money anytime soon. If/When my bank comes to take the money I can always refer them to the recorded call about the check. Thank you to everybody who has been helping so far, I'm not the brightest bulb in the building so this has been a massive learning experience. "
118,118,[NC] Liquour store denied me service,"Today was my 21st birthday, so to celebrate, me and some friends went to the ABC store.

119,119,[WA] Can I take my insulation with me when I sell?,"I am thinking about investing a lot of money insulating my attic. Can I take it with me when I sell my house?

Here is my thought process...

It's purely a matter of business. Nothing else. I'm estimating I could spend up to $5,000 in massive insulation of the attic. All the research I have done says attic insulation is a positive yield investment and the more insulation the higher the return in heating and cooling costs.

The cost to heat a home ranges from $500 to say $2,500 per year. So the payback period on a $5k insulation investment might be between say 2 and 10 years (or longer because heating costs won't go to zero). And I might only stay in the house for about 2 years. (It's a live-in, slow flip.)

So, on one hand, I want to add insulation because it makes the house more efficient to heat and cool. But on the other hand, I might not live in it long enough to get my payback. Also, $5,000 is a chunk of money to leave on the table (by including the insulation in the sale) if I don't have to.

So, I'm thinking if I move the insulation with me to my next house (before I list the existing house and leaving in the minimum amount to meet code—Question for you: what is that amount?) then I (1) retain my $5k investment, (2) make my payback period and (3) have an extra-fully-insulated attic in my next house. Seems like a win-win-win scenario for me. 

The only business reason I can think of not to do it is if it creates a legal liability vis-a-vis the fixtures issue. But who can claim the insulation is a fixture if I remove it before I list the house? In that case, it seems like insulation is not a fixture. Because who, other than I, would ever know it was even there in the first place?

Also, I've never known attic insulation to be a factor one way or the other in the purchase or sale of a house. It's never really come up for me before. I imagine most people share a similar experience. Attic insulation is just not a factor. As long as it meets code.

Is my analysis off base? What are your thoughts?"
120,120,Help with friend sentenced to prison over picture,"I don't know if there is anything that can even be offered for advice at this point. It doesn't directly concern me. But a friend of mine from work. I'm just gonna post his story. And if you have any advice for this kid please share it. The only thing I can swear to is that in the year that I've known this kid, he's just a good kid. A dorky, nice guy that I really feel like is being shafted right now.

This guy I work with we can call ""J"". When he was 19 he was talking to a girl he met online. Apparently at some point they exchanged pictures. He sent a dick pic to her. Long story short, the girl either lied about her age and she was 16. Her mother found the pic on her phone and was outraged. She went to the police. During this time he lived in Florida. But he had just set up a job in South Carolina and was moving. He told the police and asked him if everything was ok and they said that it was. A year after he moved here the police came and arrested him. This kid by now was 21 (just turned days before). He sat in jail here for a month waiting to go back to Florida. Then he sat in jail in Florida for another 2 months before being given bail.

Since that time he has been back and forth between South Carolina and Florida. Bc of the nature of our jobs (healthcare) he cannot work until this is resolved (which by the time you get to the end of this, may be never). So he lost his job, and bc of the jail time he lost his car and apartment also. The court asked him to see a psychologist for evaluation, which he did. Then they asked him to see another. Every time they asked him to do something else they told him that they were going to dismiss the case, they just had to tie up loose ends. They had him take a polygraph test as well. All of these things this poor kid did. While taking a fast food job bc he couldn't work anywhere else with this going on.

Last week he went back to Florida for another court appointment where this was supposed to be getting settled. And what ended up happening, was that the judge sentenced him to 10 months, 3 of which he's already served. Plus 5 years probation. From what I was told he's not required to register as a sex offender. But that's unclear bc his aunt (that's who gave me the information) said he's not allowed to be around children. Which to me would indicate he would be registered, but she says no. Also this guy is a gaming nerd and apparently. This sentence bars him from being allowed to access the internet.

I'm 45 years old and I've never seen a kid put through this much for doing so little. He was a 19 year old guy who sent a picture to a girl that was 3 years younger than him, and he was under the impression that she was older than she ended up being. I'm not excusing his actions, although I consider them to be extremely minor. I feel like this most likely is going to really hurt his entire life. I don't know if he can ever work at our facility again which sucks. Bc the kid is the hardest working tech that we have.

I don't know why I'm posting this other than that I have on occasion seen some incredible posts from this sub. And I figured that it was worth a shot seeing if anyone had some advice. I have been so upset about this today. I'm a very small time streamer. But once I made affiliate I pledged to help needy gamers for the first two years and all proceeds made by my channel are going to help gamers with crappy situations and this kid was the first person I was able to do something for. With everything going on he was desperate for money. And among the things he had to sacrifice was the GPU from his computer. I used funds from my channel to try to help him out and at least let him get back to doing something that was fun for him. This sentence feels like a slap in my face. I know it isn't. I'm just gutted over it.

What I'm hoping is that someone can maybe offer advice as to where he can go to from here.  He had a jacksonville, florida public defender.  Can he appeal this? Is appealing this worthwhile? I don't know if something like this is a super long shot to win an appeal with and I don't think he will be able to afford much of a lawyer.


Edit: I understand the need to downvote if you have personal feelings towards the situation. But he's my friend. And I just wanna help him. He made a mistake. We work in healthcare at a mental facility for patients that were incompetent to stand trial. I've been mentoring this kid since he moved here and he had a future in healthcare. Something like this will destroy any hope of that. I'm sure you know someone like him. Good kid that just did something dumb. "
121,121,"[Seattle, WA] Boss is requiring I work on Christmas Day even though the firm is not open then. I said to him I want it as vacation time with family but he insisted no. I'm an employee, and contracted. WTH do I do?","I work in the IT department for a small firm (it sells fashion items) based in Seattle, have worked there since April 2008, and am a full-time employee.

I received a PDF in my email which stated:

> **You are required to work on Christmas Day, 9am-6pm, and this is mandatory.**

> **You will not be paid any extra, not overtime, but will be paid.**

> **All employees are required to bring snacks, foodstuffs into the workplace and female employees must wear a bikini and hotpants or a pink, blue or white swimsuit.**

> **This will be on company social media over the holiday period and you have no choice in participation.**

> **Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action.**

> **Boss's name**


I have retained it as evidence.

I am on a contract, which expires in July 2017 according to current paperwork and am a salaried employee, not a contractor.

The firm I work for does IT-related work.

My contract states I have 12/23, 12/24, 12/25 and the period between Christmas and NYE off. This is a copy of the wording:

> At COMPANYNAME, you have as scheduled vacation:

> 12/23/YEAR - 1/1/YEAR 

> and will be paid for this. 



It doesn't trade on Christmas Day, so why would the boss want me to work these hours?

30/60 co-workers got these emails (there's 60 employees in total) so 50% of the workforce is expected to work on Christmas Day.

The firm employs nearly all women, only 2 men work for the firm (one is in marketing, the other guy works in finance/administration).

The firm is run by one individual, the boss is the highest authority.

I have actually tried complaining to the boss, but she ignored it and said I had no choice. A follow-up email confirmed this in writing (again retained as evidence).

I'm a 43-year-old mom with a 14-year-old daughter, and am married to my husband who is 39.

I don't know whether to get an attorney, or whether I need an attorney-at-law who specialises in employment law.

This clusterfuck of a situation could screw my Christmas up, why would a boss do this to employees?

I can understand EMT workers and cops working at Christmas, but asking 50% of an IT-related company to work Christmas Day?

Can anyone help me with this situation? I really am not sure where to go from here.

I can't just quit due to my contract (worries over livelihood) but I can't work on Christmas Day either due to family obligations, my mom and MIL coming down on same day too.

My endgame in this is to try and ensure I get some satisfaction; I've worked in the job since 2008, it's a job I enjoy and the boss has never requested we work Christmas Day, until now.

Where do I stand legally, and what should my next step be (I've already kept the documentation?)?"

124,124,I barely survived a 16 hour flight where I went into anaphylactic shock 2 hours into the flight. The crew could not have been more negligent. I am a wondering what the legal counseling could do for me.,"Full story below. It’s a fun one...


I have carried an epi pen for 8 years and have idiopathic anaphylaxis (basically I don’t know what I am deadly allergic to even after numerous, numerous allergy tests). 2 hours into a 16 hour flight from an Asian country to JFK, I broke out in hives just from sitting on an airplane. There was something on that plane that I was allergic to and my throat started to get scratchy. I have almost died in the past from anaphylaxis and have lost consciousness and almost stopped breathing. I immediately informed the flight staff of my allergic reaction, but it seemed like they were stalling to see how my allergic reaction would progress and did not act promptly. This is the kind of thing that can kill a person in an hour if things start to tank. I could not use my epi pens on the flight because that only gives ~30 minutes of protection and that is not a sustainable way to make it through the long flight. I explained this to the staff and also that I was trapped in a plane where I was allergic to something that I did not know and the situation would only get worse and that Benadryl would most likely not get me through the flight and epi pens would stop my heart if I used those injections as the 14 hour solution. I was certain that if I did not land, I would have died as there was no scenario where I saw myself surviving. The flight attendants didn’t give any “real” medical assistance. They called their “doctor” from the cockpit and the treatment that prescribed me to was “a cold compress”. A cold compress is not a solution to anaphylaxis. I demanded to speak to the doctor but was denied as you could only talk to the doctor in the cockpit and no passengers are allowed up there. Flight attendants kept coming up to me and would ask me the same set of useless questions (I was an EMT for 3 years and they were not asking pertinent medical questions, it just seemed like they were stalling). About 4-6 flight attendants did this to me in the span of a critical initial 30 minutes.

Luckily, I made the bold move of relocating myself to the back of the airplane where the flight attendants sit next to the bathroom and I seemed to not be as allergic. The combination of the relocation and the 12 Benadryl I took over 16 hours kept the allergic reaction at bay until I had to go back to my seat for landing. Upon returning to my seat, I broke out in much worse hives, my throat started to close, and I became very dizzy. This was full blown anaphylaxis. I used my epi pen after landing and made sure I was one of the first people off the plane.

If I had complied with that treatment, not made my bold relocation, and had not that much Benadryl (I usually only carry four in my wallet typically), I would have surely died. Without a doubt. It was by luck I made it.

Further, I was awake for 8 hours before the flight, stayed up for the whole 16 hour flight, only to get an epi pen shot at the end (epinephrine is a shot of adrenaline) so i stayed for 8 more hours on top of that for a total of 32 hours. I was jet lagged and very delirious from the 12 Benadryl and lack of sleep (for reference, people are prescribed to take one or two Benadryl at night to help go to sleep) and was the only one providing any lifesaving care to
myself. I also went straight from customs to the hospital and no one helped me from the long walk from the airplane to customs.

Also, I am a US citizen. I live in Massachusetts, and the flight was from somewhere in Asia (I think disclosing the country gives away the airline) to JFK.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I am interested in what legal actions I can take against the airline. Please let me know what the scope of my actions are. Thank you very much!

Addendum below:

Seems like I was very unclear about the doctor situation. I wrote this in one go on my phone, somewhat in anger with the airlines, so this did come out a little clunky.

Below are somethings that I believe I need to clear up:

1.	⁠I saw a doctor prior to the flight and was given a high dosage of steroids (100mg) via injection and also some to carry on board the plane. I was also given 20 Benadryl and was instructed to take 1-2 pills 3x a day.

2.	⁠My initial symptoms to hours into the flight were raised hives from my shoulders to my groin and a scratchy sensation in my throat. I have been hospitalized about five times for this, and only once did I ever have issues with my throat. During that same reaction where I had issues with my throat, I went into anaphylactic shock, briefly lost consciousness, and embarrassingly urinated myself in front of my fellow EMTs (I was still an EMT during that time and had to be transported by my coworkers). This being said, I was very, very afraid of going into anaphylactic shock again. I do not know what causes my allergies, but it is environmental. Whatever was in the economy section was causing a reaction and it as only making it worse. Staying in economy for the whole flight would have sent me into anaphylactic shock, like it did at the end of the flight, and would have killed me if we did not land early. Luckily, I found that the allergen was not near the bathroom/back of the plane.

3.	⁠The doctor I referred to was a medical consultation service. I was very unclear about this. They communicated to the medical advisor through the cockpit, where I was not allowed. I had written down all of the drugs I had taken that day on a piece of paper 30 minutes after the onset of my allergies so that they could read it to the medical advisor. This is the list below: 
6 Benadryl 
100 mg of prednisone 
My daily antihistamine

The flight attendants read on the bag of Benadryl that the dosage was 1-2 3x per day. The medical advisor advised that I have no more Benadryl on the flight as I had already take my daily dose and that I use a cold compress (I have this in writing). The flight attendants tried to stop my use of Benadryl after that. They even tried to take it away, but I didn’t let that happen. If they took away that medication, I believe I would have gone into anaphylactic shock on that plane as I had about 12 more hours to at that point and Benadryl lasts about 4 hours on your average sized person (I am 6’3” and 200 pounds - not average sized).

4. The flight attendants did not take me from my seat to a different location. I was left in my seat where the allergen was for about 10 minutes. I then started to frequent the bathroom to monitor my hives. It was back there near the bathroom I felt a difference in the air and realized that my allergen was not near there (seems strange but when the air can kill you, you can feel the difference in your lungs and mouth and on your skin). After I realized that, I started sitting in the flight attendant’s pull down chair that was in the back. I remained there for almost the rest of the flight. They tried to get me to leave a few times before we landed, but I told them no and that I would die. They told me I had to go back to my seat for breakfast and they made me leave that seat. I hid in the bathroom for about 30 minutes until that meal was over. They tried to get me come out of the bathroom as I had been i there for a while during those 30 minutes, but I lied and made a fake excuse to stay in without being bothered. After breakfast, I went back the flight attendants seat and was not bothered until landing. I asked if I could sit in that seat for landing, but was told no. I finally complied and went back to my seat after arguing for a couple minutes. I was in my economy seat for about 30 minutes and then we landed. I realized I was breaking out again and that my throat was itchy. I kept drinking water to see if it was just a dry throat (Benadryl dries your throat and I had 12 by that point) but I realized the sensation was related to the allergy. After landing, and while we were being taxied, I began to have the sensation of my throat closing and I began to feel faint. I immediately got up (no one else was standing at the time because the pilot had not said people could get up from their seats yet) and approached a flight attendant who was seated. I told them I am about to use my epi pen, that I need an ambulance, and that I need to be the first one off the plane. They rushed me to the front once the pilot deemed it was safe to stand and I used my epi pen once I got off the plane. After that I was unassisted on a long walk customs from the gate and went to the hospital.

I wish they did not try to make me stop taking antihistamines so early in the flight, I wish I had better medical consultation, and I wish I could have stayed in the  flight attendants seat for longer and did not have to seek refuge in a bathroom.

This all being said, is there anything legal counseling could do? I at least want a refund of the entire flight (it was about 1000 dollars)."

128,128,Can a hotel legally allow homeless people to clean your room?,"This is in Wyoming. 

&#x200B;

So I'm staying at an extended stay motel for work. Been here a few weeks, the owners seemed ok and I trusted them to come clean my room because they're the owners. Anyway I have tens of thousands of dollars in equipment laying around, cash, personal identity documents, etc...

So theres this guy staying in the room next to mine, who seems like hes basically one step away from homelessness. The other day my friend came over in his BMW and the guy kept asking him for money, cigarette, drugs, basically just trying to leech off him. Annoying but whatever.

Then today as I get back from work he approaches me as I enter my room and says that ""the hotel let me to clean your room"" and he asked me to spot him some money and weed. He wouldn't leave me alone when I said no and kept insisting. So I gave him 10 bucks to get him to leave me alone.

He obviously knows I have money since he saw all my stuff including my paystubs for thousands of dollars which were laying around on the table.

I have already paid for the rest of month at this hotel, so if I leave now I will be out that money. Unless I'm entitled to a refund?

Do I have any leverage over the hotel here?

I feel like my privacy has been violated and I can't even fall asleep because of my anxiety over this. I feel like this guy could easily call some homies over and rob my room while I'm away.

I can't believe the hotel would just let some random guy into my room unsupervised where he could easily steal my identity or my stuff.

 Can I fire my PD and have him replaced ?.

Will a misdemeanour have any effect on my LPR status?

Is there any possible way for me to negotiate a suspended sentence or something with the prosecution?

Is a pro-se defense a good idea if you don't think the prosecution has any non-eye witness evidence ?

132,132,Got arrested possible illegal police stop need help,"Two weeks ago I went out (Harrisburg, PA ) and had 4 or 5 beers which is too many I agree. I was driving home and was hungry and decided to stop at a Chinese takeaway place but it was closed because it was after 2 a.m.

I drove around the back of the strip mall and parked, there is parking back there too. I was sitting there for maybe 10 minutes trying to google where was open for food and also texting a friend of mine in California who was still awake.

After while there is a flashlight and knock on the window and I was surprised and saw it was a cop. I started to open the door  but he pushed it closed hard and started shouting at me to stay in the car and just roll down the window.

I rolled down the window and he asked what I was doing there and I said I’m not doing anything. He asked where was coming from and I lied and said a friend's house. 

He wanted to know how long I was sitting there and I said an hour but then he put his hand on the car and said it was warm. He asked where the keys were and I showed them they were in the cup holder.

Then he said he could smell alcohol and told me to step out and I did the tests like following the pen and stand on one leg and he said I failed and has me blow and it was .11 and I got arrested for DUI.

I want to know if this was legal for him to do because I don't think he ever saw me driving and he shouldn't have closed the door when I tried to get out honestly I could have just walked home from there if he let me."
133,133,Doctor gave us the wrong information about Depo Provera (birth control) shot. Now we might be pregnant! Can we sue?,"Last Tuesday, one week ago, my girlfriend and I went down to our local women's health center to inquire about getting her on birth control. We explained that she does not have income or insurance and that currently she is living with me at my parent's house. The attendant told us to fill out some paperwork, and that the doctor would see us shortly. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were called into the doctor's office. 

A nurse privately discussed with my girlfriend what birth control options were available to her while I waited outside. Afterward, I was brought inside to meet with the doctor and my girlfriend. My girlfriend had chosen the Depo Provera shot because she felt that it was the most convenient and reliable method of birth control available to her. 

Here's where things began to get real fucked up. 

The doctor sat down with the both of us inside the clinic and told us about the side effects of the Depo Provera shot. She told us how it would prevent ovulation and how we would have to come in every 12 weeks to renew it. She also told us that the shot would take ONE WEEK to take effect. This figure, one week, was repeated to us by both the nurse and the doctor NUMEROUS times. 

Skip forward a week after having received the injection, and both my girlfriend and I decide to have unprotected sex. It feels incredible and is a whole lot more convenient than using condoms. We proceed to have unprotected sex two more times before I head online because my girlfriend is complaining about a soreness in her leg. What I find severely disturbs me. 

The Depo Provera shot apparently takes upward of two weeks to enter a woman's system and be an effective method of birth control. I call the women's center where we received the injection, and they confirm this figure to our great distress. 

Now we're both sitting down on reddit, after taking a Plan B pill this morning (about 36 hours since we began having unprotected sex) and an ovulation test which turned out to be positive. 

What can we do if my girlfriend ends up becoming pregnant after all is said and done? Do we have any rights as patients and can we sue the doctor and the nurse who attended to us for medical malpractice? The way we see it, we were LIED to about how soon the Depo Provera would become effective. 

Honestly, right now I'm just terrified that I might be a dad, and neither me or my girlfriend is ready to raise a child right now. We don't have the conditions for it financially or emotionally. Please help!

NOTE: We are located in Florida."
134,134,[Update to] [MI/USA] My girlfriend is being blackmailed on Facebook by someone who she sent nude pictures to when she was underaged. This isn't the first time this person has tried to blackmail her.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7s5utr/miusa_my_girlfriend_is_being_blackmailed_on/](Backstory.)


After I made this post this morning the Facebook account named ""Zach"" started pressing her to talk to him more and more, finally he said ""I'm going to work and when I get out we are gunna talk."" I'd had enough of feeling helpless so I told her I was going to do something about it.



I went and borrowed my friends computer and brought it to my house and spent all day making a website with no prior experience. I bought a domain name and paid for a hosting site, and began building a fake blog for my girlfriend. I planned on using the hosts analytics to get this guys IP address but it wasn't working. I did a little research and ended up teaching myself very basic HTML, I managed to hide a IP tracer in the background, as soon as someone opened the page I got a notification sent to my email with their IP address and other basic info.



My trap was set and we waited for him to respond to her. This is the conversation, 



https://imgur.com/a/dvAkS



At this point I had her switch over to Kik because I was worried about Facebook messenger fucking with the IP address tracking of the link. Once on Kik he messaged her with an account that had her name and a profile picture of her. 



https://imgur.com/a/swN6o



In between the first and second picture she sent him the link to her blog which contained her ""nudes."" Immediately I received the notification he loaded the page and I began reverse searching his IP address to get his location. I took a screenshot of it and sent him a message on FB. 


https://imgur.com/a/7Gp3c



He wouldn't read my message and instead asked her why I messaged him, he said ""ok we can do this the hard way"" and then began to say he was going to post everything. He sent her a screenshot of him messaging the ""real Jake"" and telling him to ""control his hoe because she's acting up. Then he said he posted everything on a Tumblr page. 



At this point I had her delete her Kik and her Facebook but I left mine up with his and my conversation still open. He eventually read my messages but never responded to me. I'm positive the IP address is correct and he wasn't using a VPN because the address it returned is what I thought it would.


 I really need to know where to go from here and if I did anything wrong, my girlfriend is scared as fuck right now and I'm not sure what to do now. I have an IP address that has been location searched to a town in Alberta Canada, and a lot of incriminating screenshots. Also sorry about the formating, I'm on my phone.

135,135,Response to the fighting,"Never used Reddit before but here we go.

So, I am a 9th grader in a Virginia school. We always have issues with fights and such but it has never been this serious.

We have had four or five physical fights in the past three days. Nothing crazy, a couple punches and it was broken up. 

Everyone thought that the fighters would just be suspended and an officer would talk to them. No. The principal gave an announcement that if there was one more fight, we would go into ""lockdown"". 

He explained that ""lockdown"" is where all four grades in the school will have separate lunches, our lunch time will be cut to thirty minutes (usually in hour), and we would not be allowed to be anywhere other than the Commons in the morning. This is school wide. 

I already knew about the war crime against collective punishment. I read up on the Geneva Convention and from what i understand, the students are not protected people until this lockdown occurs. But once it does, the school is commiting a war crime. (If I am wrong please do correct me!)

If I am right about them commiting a war crime, how would I go about informing them/ accusing them/ etc.?

And if I am wrong about the war crime, I still believe that it is wrong to punish all of us for those fights. 

Edit: I completely forgot about what was actually making me angry about this. Every student has to have a remediation course during the thirty minutes taken away. "
136,136,“SAVE WATER DRINK MY PISS”,"Please read question is towards the end of post. I am currently working on a project to bring awareness to the current drought here in California. I plan on doing so by printing T shirts with the slogan “SAVE WATER DRINK MY PISS” & going around local beaches and public areas to hand these T Shirts out for free. My question to this subreddit is, in doing so would it be possible for me to be accused of sexual harassment for doing this? Obviously this is a provocative slogan which is why I’ve decided to use it to bring attention to the matter through a sort of shock value approach. I have no doubt some people without context will take offense to this and I just want to be aware of any legal issues I could potentially run into while doing so.

138,138,Cops searched my house NO warrant can I fight this and win?,"Location: New Mexico.  I moved here a year ago and I have an ongoing issue with my neighbors because they are bunch of Karens if you know what I mean.

They have called the police on me like four times for noise and claiming I parked in their space.

Two weeks ago five cops are at my door and say the neighbors complained about noice (again) and also they reported I had a lot of visitors so they think I’m selling drugs from the house which was b.s.

The cops asked if they could search the house and I said no because I just wanted to sleep.

Then the lead cop said I had two options we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Either I agree to the search right there or he locks me out of the house and gets a search warrant because he said he had probable cause to search for drugs already.   

He said he had applied for like 200 search warrants and never been denied, and when he got a search warrant if he found anything I would be in deep shit but if I cooperated and let him search now he’d go easy on me and wouldn’t arrest me today. 

So I let him search, and he found illegal items; it wasn’t drugs but I don’t want to say what it was. Just a lot of stuff I re-sell on Ebay that isn’t exactly legal. Then he arrested me right there.

I posted bail and have a court date next month and I want to know was the search legal? I guess I gave consent but I feel like the cop heavily pressured me to consent and made me feel like he would search whether I agreed or not. So in my mind the search should be illegal because I had no choice he said he would search if I agreed or not.  Isn't that illegal?"

However I am a fairly high income earner (he’s not) and I don’t want to be on child support for the next two decades, and honestly we’re not on good terms so the thought of even coparenting is infuriating. Can I legally give up this baby right after birth without the father’s consent? In Florida I have 7 days to give up the baby to a safe haven and it could be done completely anonymous so both I and the father cannot be identified."
140,140,"[Boston, MA] Chinese friend living in the city on visa wants to talk to CNN about reality of Chinese government - how to do so without repercussions of Chinese government?","My friend Suzie, 38 (not her real name), is a Chinese woman who's been here since 2014, on a H1B visa. IIRC, it's for being a network administrator. She's also a queer woman, which in China, is VERY YMMV, a femme queer woman, but nonetheless in China it's not as socially acceptable, as say, the U.S or UK to be a lesbian.

Suzie loves Boston and the city's life and wouldn't have it any other way.

As it is, she's looking to do an expose to and big interview with CNN or any mainstream news network, despite this legal requirement for Chinese citizens (source: The Sun, UK newspaper):

>  In 2017 China’s National Intelligence Law, which was conceived two years ­earlier, came into force.

> That law legally requires every Chinese citizen, every Chinese organisation and every Chinese company to assist national intelligence, if ever they are called upon. 

> To put that into perspective, technically more than a billion people have a legal duty to become spies for China if their government tells them to.

She wants to expose the true story on some things in China, like how government agents sexually harassed her and demanded to know her sexual history, underwear etc. and her values on things, she said it happened in April 2013.

As it is, how can she go on CNN or some news network nationally without the repercussions of Chinese government coming for her and causing an international incident?"

Hello, I recently had a contract signed by an employer, dictating ""...$180.00 an hour, for forty hours payable by (company), for life, regardless of termination.""

As you can imagine, this is the wage I want. They toyed me around for a few weeks and they sent me a contract via email, I changed it and went in person and announced *my* changes to *my* contract. In my state that process plus a signature defines agreement to the contract. There was another contract signed, however that was physically signed in completion first. The acting body for the company signed my contract last. Both contracts state that ""... these terms and agreements will supersede any previous oral or written contracts."" I recorded the entire interaction from my shirt pocket, as directed to me to do in precaution by an employment lawyer I had help draft the contract. The employer is refusing to honor my contract stating their contract supersedes mine.

I believe I have undeniable proof that my contract supersedes the previous. My contract also designates that ""all subject matter(s) of the document is hereby deemed fair and agreed upon by both parties.""


Do I have a solid case, or did the lawyer who helped draft the contract screw me over?

145,145,"Discrimination due to wearing glasses while sitting Proctored Online Exam, Republic of Ireland / US company"," 

Background:

For my job, it is necessary for me to complete various certifications, which you can achieve by passing an online proctored exam. Like many other tech companies, this goes through \[ExamCompany, I just made that up for privacy purposes\], which is a US company. Before covid you could do this at various on site test centers, since covid it's all online proctoring. The company I work for myself is registered here in Republic of Ireland, although the company as a whole is also a US company. I am in the Republic of Ireland.

What happened:

I logged into to my proctored exam and followed all the rules and guidelines by the customer service employees. Removed my headphones, cleaned my desk etc.

Then after I had already waited for over 45 minutes to start my exam, another customer service agent called me, let's call him Mike for now. ' Mike' then asked ' your glasses is it medical?' . I was like ' uhm excuse me?' . Then Mike again said ' your glasses, could you take them off please?' . At that moment I assumed that Mike wanted to see my face without glasses for ID verification. So I took them off, then after a moment I put them on again. Then Mike again said ' your glasses can you keep them off please?' . So I got annoyed and said ' well it's a bit difficult to make an exam while being unable to see don't you think?' . Mike then disconnected and it took another half hour before I got another agent on the line. In the end, my exam was canceled due to all the technical issues, after waiting for over 1,5 hours. They did give me a voucher code to reschedule my exam free of charge, but in my opinion that's not enough.

What are my rights in this scenario?

1. Which jurisdiction is applicable here? ExamCompany (made-up name) is American, but I am in the RoI and the company that told me to take this exam is also in the RoI. Do I need to file a discrimination claim in the RoI or in the USA?
2. I already filled out the complaint form (which I could only find by nagging another customer service agent endlessly). What else can I do? Should I contact a local lawyer here in the RoI? Does the lawyer need to have expertise in US law as ExamCompany (made up name) is, to my knowledge, american?
3. Is it possible for me to claim damages due to been having so unfairly treated by the agent requesting me to remove the glasses? I could not find anything about glasses in the exam proctoring regulations.
4. Any other idea as to what rights I have in this situation? I already informed my employer about the incident and she was very empathizing. I do understand that only ExamCompany (made up name) is at fault here, and not my own employer. All my own employer did was request me to take the exam and pay for a voucher code, but they are not responsible for the exam proctoring."

149,149,Venue far more tickets than they should have to a New Years Eve event and basically cheated me out of $75. Is there any way to force them to give a refund?,"Okay, so a couple friends and I were deciding where to go for New Years Eve. We found that a local mall-type place was hosting an event  that offered live DJs, open bar from 9:00-2:00, small appetizers, etc. This place had a great location, good view and it seemed perfect, especially since we found a deal where it was discounted to $75 per person instead of the initial $125.

Well, we went there at about 10:00 and we should have known it was too good to be true the minute we got there. The entrance was absolute madness.. insane lines just to get in, get your ticket checked and put your wristband on. I'm talking lines about as bad as the security lines at a busy airport. They were selling tickets for $5 a piece to check your coat, but eventually had to stop that because they LITERALLY RAN OUT OF ROOM to store coats.. everyone who went in afterwards had to just hold on to them.

The venue itself had two bars set up and both were just absolutely mobbed. I would estimate hundreds of people waiting in a crowd around each bar. I spoke to some people afterwards and they said it took about 45 min - 1 hour to get one drink. Like, are you kidding me? I'd rather just pay normal price at that point because an hour of my time is worth far more than that.

I will say one good thing, the appetizers they had were decent. Small sliders, meatballs, etc. We ate some food and then decided to leave after about half an hour and went to a different place near our apartment which was much better and only had a $20 cover. Nice crowd, cheap drinks. Should have just gone there in the first place.

Basically, I think it is 100% obvious that they sold too many tickets. They knew, or damn well should have known, the place could only reasonably accommodate a certain number of people, but they sold far more tickets than that anyway. I think it is fraudulent to advertise an event as having an open bar if it requires you to stand in line for an hour to get a single drink. I feel like I paid $75 for some OK sliders.

Is there any point in pursuing a class action lawsuit against the organizers? Location is New Jersey btw.  

EDIT: Just realized there's a typo in the title and I can't edit that. Should say venue SOLD far more tickets. Oh well."

My niece is 15. She lives with her mom, her mom's sister (my SIL's) and her cousin (my nephew, age 18). She was prescribed painkillers. My nephew was taking them. My niece called the police on him. The police came and she was home alone and she let them in and gave them permission to come in and look around. They found her empty prescription bottle in the garbage can in his room and so they went looking for him. He was arrested with some of the pills in his car, all in single baggies and they found incriminating messages on his phone.

All of this has caused a great deal of drama in my family. My niece is staying with her dad now and my nephew is now facing felony charges. Was it legal for my underage niece to allow the police to come in and search her mom and aunt's house without them home. If the police had not come in they would not have had probable cause to stop and search my nephew. My niece also didn't tell her doctor to have the prescription replaced or report it to the pharmacy.

I'm on a laser treatment for a pigments disorder areas on my back and thigh. The treatment's been going on for nearly a year and my thigh's pigment area's coming to a full heal. However, at the clinic today the nurse who done the laser treatment to me made a mistake and raise the heat to 1350 decimals instead of 350 on the thigh area and it cause a big burn. It will swell and I'll feel lot of pain later I'm sure. The doctor went in to exam me later and said it's only as bad as a sun burn and will prescript some burn medicines to me.

I'm still at the clinic right now trying to get a report for today but front desk said they can't give it until doctor reviewed and published and come back to next visit. I didn't like this at all and I'm going to file a complaint against them, perhaps sue if the burn is severe. I wonder if anyone's gone through the complaint process before and what kind of documents I must have?

So far I asked for - Nurse's name & ID, doctor's name who examined me after the burn, clinic name, clinic's ID, a report of what happened today sign and acknowledge by the clinic, the laser treatment machine model.

156,156,Wrongfully Accused of Shoplifting. Recorded Interaction. Civil Recompense Possible?,"Hi, today I was wrongfully accused of shoplifting and told to exit a store (it was a CVS/Walgreens). What are my options?

I surreptitiously recorded the final 15 minutes of the interaction with my cell phone held to my chest (I googled it on my phone beforehand, it's in a single-party consent state and obviously the store had signs everywhere advising patrons and employees they were being surveilled.)

It seems likely I'm not the only customer this store management has engaged in similar behavior towards, and rather than letting the humiliation slide, I'd like to pursue any form of punishment I can upon the store and its management.

It seems there isn't much I can do as far as filing any sort of civil rights complaint, etc., the federal website makes clear they ""don't pursue single instances"" and short of sitting outside that store for the rest of my life hoping I'm there when it happens to someone else, so I can get their info to file a complaint, I don't see any productive options on that end.

From Googling online, it seems I should request the store retain it's surveillance video before they destroy it? How do I do so without paying a lawyer to send such a request?

What other options do I have?

Note: I'm happy to post my video online for anyone's review if that might be helpful. I'm hesitant to now, as I'm worried wilfully posting a (humiliating) video might hurt my chances to later claim some sort of damages from said humiliation?

The video isn't particularly exciting, I can sum up it up thusly:

* I start the video (after becoming uncomfortable from this woman who had been following me around, literally less than 2 feet from me the entire time, while I was Googling the contents of Atkins snacks and comparing them). If memory serves, I'm not sure I said anything to her prior to that, other than when entering the store and asking if they offered 'low-carb' foods

* 3ish minutes after starting the surreptitious recording, I begin to ask her a question (specifically I ask her what exactly ""net carbs""means vs the carbs on the nutritional panel). 

* Her responses are bizarre and aggressive. (I'm not kidding. They were along the lines of, ""Are you trying to be condescending to me?"" ""Why are you condescending to me"" I find that bizarre, making me feel like maybe she wasn't following me around for shoplifting and is genuinely possibly crazy. At that point I ask her if anyone else can help me.)

* Over the span of 7 minutes I find another employee, ask them the net carbs question, and discuss it with them. While this is happening, she's started talking on the phone with (presumably) her manager.

* I hear something along the lines of ""he has a white backpack and he's black."" I didn't register that she had said it at the time, because truthfully, I was more concerned with the net carbs question (if you've ever tried a no carb diet you'll understand).

* The final 5 minutes are her, phone in hand, coming up to me declaring ""You need to leave the store now."" Me saying ""Why?"". At that point, I was a bit surprised to be kicked out as I assumed any crazy theories of hers might abate once I finished my purchase. But I did insist on her giving me a reason, even when she began to declare ""I'm calling the police right now."" As I hadn't done anything wrong, I wasn't particularly worried about the police coming. But I am under the impression, however, that (admittedly from myself or friends being a bit too drunk in bars during undergrad) that any private business can throw you out/refuse you service for any reason. However, I did still insist on asking why repeatedly. I wanted her to state a reason (in the event it was, as I suspected, based on me being a 20ish African American male in a store primarily frequented by affluent suburban whites).

* Finally she does give an answer, which is slightly elucidating, ""You come in here all the time and steal. You and your white backpack full of our things. Don't ever come back here. I know someone saw you steal once. 2 weeks ago. You're always here.""

* Now, I'm rarely even in this State in question, as I'm only there when I'm looking after my parent's home when they've gone out of state or if I'm visiting for some reason (sometimes just to do laundry--which is expensive in the city). I don't doubt I've been in this store before, but never any time of particular note, as I couldn't tell you the last time I was in the store. Either way, at this point I leave, having received my answer.

In the best case scenario, this employee was going only by description and confused me with another African American male with a white backpack who was a known shoplifter (although, in that case I'm not sure why they wouldn't just immediately call the police?). Or maybe I had been inside that store beforehand and they assumed I had shoplifted then?

In the worst case scenario, that employee harasses any African American who enters this store (it's not an expensive store, but it's in a very affluent area and provides things, like prescriptions or groceries, only someone living locally would be interested in shopping for), and anyone they've harassed has been so embarrassed/not a local so they've just never pushed back and this nasty person has never faced consequences.

**Either way, I find this treatment ludicrous, and I'm furious at the idea that there doesn't seem to be an easy way for me to exact punishment. Is there no means of punishing a discriminatory business in this country unless they've posted a sign up that says ""Whites Only""?!?!**

157,157,i bought almond ice cream for myself and my allergic roommate ate some,he has history of eating my ice cream so i bought almond because i know he can’t eat it. but he did eat it and now i’m worried he might try to charge me for something
158,158,Police waited outside of my work to pull me over for having no license plates,"I live in nebraska, US, for context. 

I have been driving my car without plates or insurance because money has been very tight and it’s the only way for my boyfriend and I to get to our jobs. 

Yesterday as I was closing, I noticed a cop car parked across the street just sitting there in a position to where he could easily see where my car was parked. I didn’t know for sure if they were for me, but I had the suspicion. About ten minutes later I was done and the cop was gone. My plan was to just quickly go home (I live directly five blocks down the street) and get to work on getting insurance because I had just got paid and could actually afford it with this check since my boyfriend got his tax returns and we would be alright. 

I got into my car and as soon as I pulled out, the cop pulled out from behind a car a block back at the exact same time and followed me a block before pulling me over. He said they noticed I had been driving for more than 60 days without plates and asked how long I had the car. I said three months. 

I’m being charged with expired tags and no proof of insurance. I have court on the 11th for the fine and to plead guilty/not guilty. 

What should I do? I’m not upset that I was caught, but about the fact that the cop had sat out there for so long and then moved so I thought he had left. Is that illegal? It just doesn’t feel right. My boyfriend wants to fight it on the terms that it’s harassment, but I just don’t know what’s the best way to approach this so that i don’t come out with insane debt that I can’t afford right now. Any advice would really be appreciated

Tldr: cop sat outside my work and then hid down the block until I left so he could immediately pull me over. My boyfriend and I think we should fight it, but I’m not sure. I need advice please."
159,159,Harassed by Home Owners Association can I turn off their water,"I love in California and the home owners association for the neighborhood we live in are constantly sending us notices about various things we need to do with our house for example we recently got a fine because we had 2 signs in the yard and your only allowed one however 1 was an ADT sign informing people that there are cameras on the property (which is legally required in Ca) and the other sign was a graduation sign for my sister. They have sent 2 other notices in the last month all for different things, and my parents don’t want to go to file harassment because it’s not worth the effort. Everyone has their water shutoff valves behind their garage, so could I legally shut off their water (I only plan to do this for 2 days before turning it back on)"
160,160,Can the police change their mind and give you a speeding ticket later?,"This is in NJ. 

Long story short, I got pulled over for speeding. To give me a ""break"", the officer gave me three bullshit tickets, one of them being for my plate being obstructed from the frame that came from the car dealership. 

I spoke to the manager at the dealership, he said he'd pay for it but recommended I pay it myself because he'd have to report the fact that he paid the ticket to the police department. And that if they found out, they'd give me the real speeding ticket that I deserve because they have radars. 

So, will the police department be able to hunt me down, take me to court and prove that I was speeding? And if they can, will the judge accept this practice and make me accountable? The fact they're giving bullshit tickets then when I call them out they give me a speeding ticket. Has that ever happened before?


Should I insist the dealership pay for all three bs tickets? Do I have a case to take the dealership to court because it was their fault I got these tickets? The dealership didn't prevent me from removing the frame. But they're actively being accomplices in malpractice of the law, they're aware of what the police department is doing. They're knowingly putting these shitty frames that will end up getting you tickets. 


Edit: What this all comes down to: Are the cops likely to hunt my ass down for having the dealership pay the tickets? 

I can tell you the dealership manager was pissed when I bluffed and said I spoke to my lawyer and he highly recommended I take his offer of paying. 


Edit 2: The three tickets in total are 162 dollars. I think I'm just going to pay them for now. But after that, I'm going to come back to the dealer and ask to be reimbursed without providing the ticket numbers (aka asking not to be snitched on) if they ever want my business again. "
161,161,Can I use any legal tender to pay child support?,"My divorce decree says I just have to pay $350 a month. Doesn't say how or when. For the last 5 years I've been paying by check but one or two bounced and she is refusing to accept them now. She is asking that I pay via ACH or electronic transfer or check through my bank. She refusing to take cash from me.  

Since the decree doesn't stipulate, I'd like to pay her in change as a statement. Like when I drop my kid off just hand her a bucket of change for exactly $350. Does she legally have to accept that if the decree doesn't say how I have to pay her?

What happens if she just refuses to take it?    


I've done this with creditors before and they have always taken it.

162,162,Got a call from my apartment manager about my dog. She may have to be removed from the property. I feel this is not fair. What are my options?,"[Original Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8uywmz/one_of_the_kids_my_dog_usually_plays_with_wasnt/)

I’m in WA State. 

Got a call from my apartment manager today. No surprise. Sure enough, there was a complaint over the weekend that my dog “attacked” someone (NOT true.)

So I gave her my side of the story. I told her my dog did not “attack” anyone. My dog did not bite, lunge, growl or bark at the girl. I was outside the entire time and witnessed this. Her father was not.

The apartment manager is gathering statements from other residents who supposedly “witnessed the attack.” I have major concerns about this. There is a big community of a certain ethnic group who live at the apartment complex (the family accusing us is part of this community.) They all know each other and regularly go to each other’s apartments, etc. I am concerned that I will not get fair representation in the matter as the apartment manager said she will only be interviewing residents who “witnessed the attack” (whom the accusers are all friends with.)

I asked the apartment manager if she’d be willing to talk to my friends, family, other residents, as well as apartment staff who have been at my apartment when the kids have interacted with my dog. She said she will only be taking statements from people who “witnessed the attack” (again, no one but me, my pup, and the little girl were in the courtyard during this incident.)

If the “witnesses” say my pup was being aggressive, she will have to be removed from the property. This is giving me terrible anxiety. She is my emotional support animal. I can not afford to move or break my lease. What are my options? 

Edit: My dog is an 18 lb. French Bulldog "
163,163,[WA] Taken to jail for violating a restraining order that was not in my name.,"(Had to repost due to error in title. Apologies.)

In 2012 I spent a few days in jail because of a restraining order. In the restraining order, my name is incorrectly stated and my birthday is incorrect. The officer said ""Close Enough"" and took me to jail. I've read the statute of limitations on cases like this is ~2 years. As a result of and in addition to this incident, I also have a domestic violence charge to my name that currently (as of 2017) affects my ability to get a job.

Does the statute of limitations apply to a situation that has consequences as a result of a false imprisonment? It is past the ~2 years for the initial false imprisonment, but I still feel the effects of the situation. Can I pursue a legal matter?"
164,164,My 20 yr. old son who I haven't ever spoken with is trying to blackmail me into paying backpay for child support. Can I sue him? [Canada],"I am in Nova Scotia Canada.

To get specific I made a mistake when I was young and left his mother because I was not in any position to raise a child. She never pursued child support probably because she didn't want anything to do with me and knew if I was giving her money then I would want to see my son. We were never married. I was 19.

Anyway 20 years later I get a letter from my son who I have never spoken to and he is telling me I owe him thousands of dollars in backpay. I guess he wants me to pay for his college. Well I have two young daughters now and I am happily married and I couldn't pay him even if I wanted to which I don't.

He is threatening to involve lawyers etc and raising a big stink. He claims that because his mom raised him by herself for all this time and I never contributed anything it is ""right"" for me to chip in now. I do not believe he has a leg to stand on but I am just making sure. I do not want to hire a lawyer unless I am at risk in which case I will do it.

166,166,Fertility Clinic Lost Semen Sample,"  This just happened, so I am a little pissed….

Wife and I had a baby 2 years ago using a fertility clinic. Trying to have number 2 for the last several months (we are almost 40 so we are not at our reproductive prime and every wasted month is precious). Went today to deposit a semen sample so my wife could have an IUI today. 

Wife goes to clinic and after a 90 minute wait is informed that they made a mistake and the sample went for an analysis instead of being prepared for an IUI, so it is essentially destroyed. Timing is everything with an IUI, so I could go give another sample but I am too pissed to step foot in that building.

I am beyond livid – I feel like I should let everyone of their patients know that this type of this could happen to them. What are my options?"
167,167,Just off the lot (~200mi) 2022 car totaled by underinsured driver (they are deemed at fault). Their insurance is starting to cause problems.,"Location: Phoenix, Az
Date: Sunday Jan. 16th 2022

My dad just bought my mom a new car for her Birthday Dec. 8th. It was custom ordered so they had to wait for it to be built (Ordered late Nov, Dec. 8th build date on her Birthday, delivery expected ~late Dec. - mid Jan.) My parents went to pick up the car and drove it home on Jan. 9th. This is the first ever new car my mom(52) has owned, and it was something she was really excited about.

They decided to celebrate they were going to take out their brand new car on a day trip to enjoy and get used to it. Before they were even out of the city they hit a large slowdown due to construction after cresting a hill, so they slowed down and eventually stopped. Moments later they were impacted hard from behind (while they had been stopped for 30s -1min) There are police already on the scene and the accident is dealt with, the other vehicle was towed and my parents car was still operational so they drove to their home and called me to take them to the ER. They are fine, just shaken up and had to take a few days off work for muscle pain/fatigue 

according to the other drivers insurance company, the driver reported they were going between 40 and 50 miles an hour at the time of the collision. It was probably faster than that because everyone talks down how fast they were going to try to avoid more punishment. This seems extremely negligent and alone should pose grounds for further damages or compensation.

A few days past, their insurance is taking the full responsibility and decided to total out the car due to a bent frame, but the at fault driver only has 15k liability (Az State minimum) my parents do have underinsured motorist coverage, but did not purchase gap insurance as they planned to pay the car in full at time of sale (that was messed up by the agent doing the paperwork and didn't include a deposit they placed when getting their build slot, so they had to have it on a loan until that paperwork was straightened out) 

My parents had to take several days off work, they had to share a car for 3 days after that until the rental (that their insurance will be paying for) came, my father was forced to work from home during that time, my mother is extremely distraught as this was the nicest and newest car she had ever had and only had it for a handful of days.

The issue lies here,
Their insurance company is going to pay the $15,000, and offered a maximum of $5,000 total for medical expenses, inconvenience', as well as pain and suffering between the two of them. Which we feel is disrespectfully low considering my mother is still as of posting this and having anxiety/emotional distress, as well as tension headaches due to this accident. Even just talking to her about it last night getting more of this information caused her to burst into tears again. 

My parents insurance will be paying out the difference in the price of a USED 2022 Toyota Corolla with 200 miles (actual amount is tbd) the car was $27,000 new. 
The difference in value aside, If my parents decided to purchase a brand new car again to replace exactly what they lost (Same spec must be ordered factory), It wouldn't arrive until April. Their insurance company is only willing to pay for the rental until my parents accept the $15,000 + $5,000. Basically once they are able to pay for the car their insurance will not continue to provide transportation until the new car arrives. 
Overall this seems extremely disrespectful to my parents as the initial pain and suffering amount was under $3,000, And they said the most they could do was $5,000 as well as not covering the rental car.

 What are our options here? Do we take them to court? My parents have never been in a situation like this, neither have I,
and we're at a loss for what to do. 

As of right now we are waiting for them to come pick up the car, we have not accepted the $5k, And we are still waiting on the official police report.

Edit: Why the heck are all my replies being downvoted? Kinda rude guys. I'm trying to see what I can do / advice I can offer for my parents having been in this really stressful situation. :/"
168,168,"My ex- told me she was raped by a classmate, then I was threatened and arrested for exaggerated charges after trying to turn him in, then she says in an email a month later that she was repeatedly pressured by our university to file a police report and was sexually assaulted. [CA]","In late March, the woman (A) I still loved told me a man (B) in all of my classes raped her after a party... Then we get into a really intense argument while I was driving about tuning him in, she is crying and saying that she simply can't do it. But I was experiencing a manic episode (clinically bipolar) triggered by amphetamines and was too wrapped up in the hysteria to empathize with her position. There was no compromise in my mind, if I had to see him in class I was definitely going to be arrested for felony assault/battery and I was on probation.. I kept persisting and trying to convince her that we have to go to the police right now for the rape kit, but she was screaming her lungs out at me. A block away from the police station, she started mauling my face and I am forced to pull over immediately. She stopped clawing me when we pull over and she hops out, I'm screaming out of anger and banging on the window. Then sure enough, a cop car across the street saw it all unfold, flashes their sirens and interview the both of us. I tell them what happened (aside from her assaulting me) and they talk to her for 10 minutes, then I'm let go and told to leave her alone. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I started completely whacking out after that; I called everyone I knew at the party to see if there had been an suspicious behavior/actions from B. I didn't explicitly say that she assaulted, but it was very evident from my syntax and sense of urgency. 

&#x200B;

The next day (Monday), I went to the Assistant Dean of Students (C) trying to figure out what the wisest decision would be.. I tell her everything I knew aside from the names involved and she tells me that it is up to A to file the complaint if I am not willing to disclose their identities.

&#x200B;

That afternoon I get a phone call from her ex-boyfriend of two years (D) telling me that A does not want to go the police because I'm on probation, but will do what she has to do if I keep pursuing B. I basically told him to fuck off because the threat made no sense. Then he calls my dad; D continues to reference my criminal history throughout conversation, validates the rape allegations, and says she is ""not stable, but definitely not suicidal."" 

&#x200B;

That night I contact the student government rep of my major and tell him everything I knew, and the dominoes began to fall. He schedules an interview with A and notifies the administration; I had done everything I could do and I completely detach myself from the circumstance with hopes that I will never have to see B again in my life.

&#x200B;

The next day : C tells me that I am intermittently suspended for:

&#x200B;

1. It was reported that on March 25,, 2018 you forced A into your car, physically grabbed her arms and neck, and forcibly pushed her out of a moving car.

2. It has been reported that you have publicly accused another student of sexual assault.

&#x200B;

I get photos that night from D of the letter she wrote to the school and he asked me how the revenge had gone.

&#x200B;

Then I am arrested that Thursday for Felony Kidnapping, Domestic Violence, and Criminal threats; the case was dropped by the DA, but the CA picked it up as a misdemeanor because of my previous violent charge (or so I think).

&#x200B;

I then receive an email from A quoted in the email I sent to C, which should explain the gaps in my story/logic.

&#x200B;

""Dear C,

&#x200B;

I have a direct quotation  from the Complainant's own writing that unequivocally accuses yourself  and the campus police of violating the Title IX Policy and Procedure. 

&#x200B;

Here are the three components of the Title IX Policy and Procedure for the Complainant's Intake Interview that pertain to filing a police report:   


**"" 5. Inform the Complainant of the right to file a criminal complaint with local law enforcement or with the Office for Civil Rights;**  
 **6. Offer to assist the Complainant with filing a criminal complaint;**  
 **7. Assure the Complainant that such filing will not significantly delay the College investigation; ""**  


This is what the complainant has stated verbatim, **""the LAST thing I want to do was go to the police because I knew you were on  probation but the school kept pressuring me to file a police report and then the campus security as well""**   
Less than a month after the sequence of events transpired on April 17th, she made the definite accusation against yourself in the attached email and there would be no room for interpretation in a court of law. If  there is any ambiguity in her writing, please inform me.  
I notified you the afternoon of March 26th at the CSE that my  ex-girlfriend, of whom you found out was A the following day,  told me she was raped and hated me for my pursuit of B. We  spoke for roughly forty-five minutes and I explained to you everything I  knew outside of the names of the students involved.  
Both definitive statements made from myself to you on March 26th are  verified in the following paragraph from the same email on April 17th.

  
**""I was sexually assaulted by B yes. I was in denial. and then when you  were chasing me down yelling at me saying i cheated on you i kept  realizing how much i really didn't like it and then i said i was raped. I  don't know if i was raped maybe i didn't try hard enough idk but i was  definitely sexually assaulted. the fact that you think would fucking  make that up to ruin your life is disgusting. I had to go to fucking  planned parenthood and get checked for STDs bc i was fucking assaulted  how humiliating is that and then you went and messaged EVERYBODY. how  fucking embarrassing. I never wanted to take the issue to the school  because i don't feel threatened by him he's a complete fucking imbecile.  But the fact that you took what happened to me and used it to try and  get revenge is just disgusting.""**

  
You were fully aware and informed of the possibility that A could have been **""raped""** by B and emotionally compromised by my revenge towards him; yet you and the Campus Police proceeded to **""pressure""**  a traumatized, sexual assault victim into filing a police report. If  A's language is indicative of any other conclusion, please  inform me.   
Regardless of your obvious deviation from the Title IX Procedure and clear-cut negligence as Assistant Dean of Students, what was stated in my previous email still stands:

  
**""The first confounding article of evidence that needs acknowledgement are the threats made through D, A's ex-boyfriend, the afternoon of March 26th, 2018. In the phone call I received at roughly 5:00 pm, there were two vital aspects of the conversation. First, he confirmed that the rape did indeed happen; B had violated A and stated verbatim that she was “not stable, but definitely not suicidal.” A testimony in itself that should raise reasonable doubt to the truthfulness and permissibility of any statements or allegations provided by A. A has clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders, was reliant on 150 mg of Escitalopram (nearly ten-fold the recommended FDA dosage), and consumed excessive marijuana and alcohol near the end of our relationship. Coupled with the fact that she had told me verbatim“I was raped” the night before, the psychological state D described seemed entirely accurate. But the derivative of A’s motive appeared when D brought up the fact that I am on misdemeanor probation and executed a veiled threat in regards to my revenge towards B. He told me verbatim that A “doesn’t want to report me because of my prior, but will have to do what she has to do to protect herself \[if I keep pursuing B\].” The behavior D exhibited was erratic, questionable and indicative of A’s compromised neuro-chemical stability. Here are three isolated incidents that corroborate with my allegations. The first is addressed in a previous email with the police report that discounts all four of the University’s allegations towards myself. Officer E stated, “Based on my observations and statements obtained I did not feel that the incident rose to the level of a crime, and it appeared more to be a ‘415 boyfriend/girlfriend.’” Along with an abundance of other inconsistencies between Officer E's and A’s account; from him not witnessing what A had stated just happened to her before exiting the vehicle, to “not appearing distressed or traumatized” after I had allegedly assaulted and threatened her. Her formal allegations submitted days later towards myself simply do not make empirical sense, police trained to be hyper-vigilant of domestic violence experienced an alternative timeline to A’s and did not believe I committed a crime. Second, following the phone call from D, I contacted the Film Student Government Representative, F at around 11pm and told him everything I knew regarding the sexual assault allegations. He reached out to A and scheduled a meeting for the following morning. The timing of A’s letter is remarkably syncopated with my deviation from D’s demands, and the motive becomes exceptionally clear. Especially when I receive texts with photographs on March 28th of A’s letter to F from D, asking me how my revenge had gone. This daunting correlation further transcends into causation from the fact that my father received a phone call from D as well later that evening on March 26th. D validated the “rape” allegations, also stated that “she was not stable, but not suicidal,” and mentioned my vulnerable criminal history in correspondence to my pursuit of B; which my father also interpreted as a veiled threat. Beginning with a crime that never occurred in the eyes of officers of the law and their testimony that refutes all four of the allegations against me, then evolving into As indirect threats through D that are validated by my father’s testimony, and finally the execution of her mandate in correspondence to my conversation with F; there are a myriad of ethically devoid actions made towards myself that need to be addressed.""**  


>If  there is any inclination of my allegations not bearing the truth,  please inform me. I will provide you with phone records, testimonies,  and any other evidence I can attain.

Also to the people saying all the cops have is no evidence of the assault and only evidence that I had his plate, there were two eyewitnesses that I told the police about, I gave the contact information of one and the other one was the owner of a bar within the same plaza, as far as I currently know the police did not look into my witnesses whatsoever as I talked to one of them and she said she never received a phone call. once again it took them 6 hours to get here, the bar was probably closed not that they were going to check that witness anyway. and they didn't contact the witness that was in my passenger seat. She had other errands to do that day so she was not there when the police finally showed up. Now I think because the court dates have already been handed out to me I don't think there's anything else I can do with the local police. But given the fact that he did not get a court date for the assault my witnesses can't even give their statement. 

Edit #2 This is the legal advice subreddit, but everyone here seems to think we're in r/Captainhindsight. Almost every comment is about how ""I"" should have done things differently. That's not what I'm here for, And that's not what this place is about. So to all the people who actually said nothing productive, and just laid into me about what I ""should have done"" y'all can sit and spin. And to the very few people that actually know what this subreddit is for, and gave advice. Thank you. Its taken into consideration. 

Edit #3 apparently people still think I was  intoxicated because they couldn't understand certain euphemisms I used durring this post. The word punch-drunk does not ** mean I was drinking alcohol

The actual definition is this: 

punch-drunk

/ˈpənCHˌdrəNGk/

adjective

stupefied by or as if by a series of heavy blows to the head.

So that basically means after sustaining blows to the Head my cognitive function was not working properly I was in duress adrenaline and I just got smacked in the head so any actions that I did during the 30 seconds from him opening his mouth to him walking back into his car and me taking the plate. I cannot be blamed for any action that happened after I sustained injuries to the Head. That absolutely will not fly in court. Secondly if everyone thinks that I ripped the plate off vindictively as he hopped back into his car, driving away from a violent crime he just committed I tried to stop his car but the only thing I could grab onto was his plate which incidentally came off as he started to drive away from the violent crime he just committed. To which I immediately called the police to explain the situation. I had no intention of fighting this man at all. But I am allowed to stand by my car as far as I'm concerned that's not illegal and someone walking up to me and punching me in the head several times, I am apparently in the complete wrong for simply standing by the door of my car in a parking lot and then after I was assaulted I cannot be blamed for any actions because I wasn't thinking straight. I'd like to see a few people take a couple knocks to their head, And then try to say the alphabet backwards. I can't believe I really had to even make this edit but people are really of the opinion that I deserved to be assaulted by someone twice my size because I simply didn't hop into my car  I shouldn't have to go into my car for cowering for safety while at a local convenience store grabbing a soda. This isn't fucking Compton. There's relatively no gang violence here and it's not like there's a local rapist running around. In this society I should feel safe from harm to my body and possessions regardless any words said. I committed no hate crime I essentially said ""yeah fuck you too."" We both said equal verbal abuse to one another and this man within 5 seconds went from 0 to 100 and  immediately started with the assault. I don't believe in any way that I am in the wrong and if any of you think otherwise you're probably just a psychopathic is the guy that assaulted me. Thank you. 


I live in Brampton Ontario Canada. i went to a convenience store by my house on my way home to get a drink. on my way out son Douch bag said something along the lines of ""there fucking lines on the ground for a fucking reason. its winter here and the road and faded paint are in pretty shit condition. So I replied back with ""yea fuck you too"" the guy the hops out of his car, and so did I, now in most instances like this all people do is just talk shit till one guy figures its not worth it, and leave, this is the exception, this man came up to my face, grabbed my shirt and just started feeding me fists, he then hopped back in his car and started to drive away. i tried to read his plate but i was punch drunk, in duress, and Adrenalin pumping, so as he drove away i grabbed onto his licence plate, and it ripped off as he drove away, i then immediately called the police, now this happened at 4:30 pm the cops showed up at my house at 10:30pm a whole 6 hours later. and there only concern WAS HIS PLATE! That's the first thing they asked me for, not are you alright, do you need medical assistance, nothing. wheres the plate? i handed it to them as I was only holding it as evidence about the occurrence. I earlier found out where he lived by driving around the neighbourhood looking for a blue honda with no plate. yellow paged the address, and found a last name to the house, facebook the last name and found the culprit. also found his insta gram where he trains as a mma/boxer, I'm just an average dude, so when the cops come i show my torn shirt, the fact i had the plate number and everything, had him dead to rights. THEY CHARGED ME WITH THEFT AND VANDALIZEM BECAUSE I TOOK HIS PLATE. i all ready did their fucking job of finding the guy, and there is no cameras where the indecent happened, and once again, dazed, and rocked, i did the next best thing before he drove off, the cops even victim shamed me saying that i could have taken a photo, right...... and the cherry on top. the future wife beater got a ""stern talking to"" by the police.... i have no faith in the justice system anymore. this was fucking unbelievable. not that they were working the case durring this time anyway for 6 hours but i sure as shit saved them a bunch of fucking time going to the plaza and looking at grainy images that may or may not exist on the cameras at the plaza. and I get charged...... is there any body i can contact to right this clear wrong, apparently in ontario, the police get to pick who gets charged not the victim. they actually said to me, just because he assaulted you doesn't give you the right to vandalise his property. MOTHER FUCKER IF I DIDN'T DO THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND HIM TO BEGAN WITH.

TL;DR: I got assaulted, ripped the guys plate off as he started to drive away as evidence that it was him, and i got charged with theft and vandalizem and the assaulter got no charge what so ever."

176,176,Immediate Help needed! My wife is threatening not to allow me to have my kid because I'll be late.,"My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. We have a six year old. She has primary custody and I have visitation. I am suppose to pick him up on Fridays at 4 but today I had to go in two hours late and work for someone ( I work in retail). I told her a few hours ago when she texted me to make sure I was coming today that I wouldn't be there until 6:30. The custody order in the decree say 4 and doesn't say anything about lateness. I get him 3 weekends a month for a total of six days a month. 

My wife says she has plans tonight for a work event in another town and she only made them because she knew it was my weekend. She said she needs to leave by 4:45 to make it and will be taking him with her if I don't show by 4:45. 

It is impossible for me to leave work at 4:45. I can not leave until 6:15 and it would take me 15 minutes to get to her house so 6:30 is my only reasonable time. 

We are suppose to make reasonable accommodations to the custody schedule when we have emergencies. I consider this a work emergency. 

What are my rights here? 

She is saying if I am not there by 4:45 she is taking my son with her and I can a) either drive out to that town and hour and a half away and pick him up b) I can see him on saturday when she drives in probably around 10am 

My argument is that I am sometimes late. She knows my schedule isn't like that and 4pm isn't always feasible.  And that she is taking a kid at age 6 to a work art show. She claims it isn't that kind of adult art show and that she has to go because her intellectual disability provider workplace is hosting the show. She said it isn't kid friendly but not really kid adverse either. There will be drinking there but she said she obviously won't be drinking. They will staying at a hotel there. He will be out past 10.

My parents are out of town and can't go get him for me. 

Decree doesn't allow for makeup days so I just lost a day.

177,177,Help with FBI Case,"I went to US in August 2016 as a Student (F1 Visa) from Asia. After 4 months, I transferred to a school in Texas. In Feb 2017, I met a women who needed some help to extract lost data from her computer, so she said (Remember, I’m not supposed to work legally as I’m on F1 Visa). I (22 years old then) met her around 6 PM, apparently it wasn’t her computer the data was in, it was a website. I told her that can’t be done as we don’t have any access to that website. She told she had to show the data to someone tomorrow morning, and she would pay me $5000 if I can replicate the website and put data on the website, just to show to someone (she was about to lend money from the guy and he had to see data to give her money). So, I got greedy and did the website that was only accessible in that area of Texas and submitted to her the next morning. I took the payment in check, as I couldn’t work, I made her write check on my friend’s name who had Employment Authorisation Documents.

Next thing I know, I was making fake documents for her like electricity bills, phone bills and that kind of stuffs. She used to pay $200 for each bundle and each bundle used to have one electricity bill, phone bill, bank statement, life insurance, house lease document. I did around 10 bundles for her. Then I stopped working for her because we got into a fight as she didn’t pay me for all the work I did for her. Total money I took from her was around $10,000 MAXIMUM.

After 19 months of me replicating that website, I came home one morning (I used to work night shifts in a gas station, still illegal), and found FBI in my house. They were there because I had hacked a government website, or they thought. They were talking about the website I replicated. It was a government website, I didn’t know the time I did that. And, they asked me so many questions, I answered everything honestly and truthfully. They also knew about the documents I faked. They were there with search and seizure warrant so they didn’t take me with them. They thought I hacked their website or created a phishing website to steal money from government and peoples. I told them that wasn’t what the website was for, it was for one girl who wanted to lend money from some guy showing some data and all the data in the website were fake - randomly generated, just to show to the money-giving guy. They definitely thought the case was way bigger than it actually is.

The crimes I did was, replicating website, creating fake documents, working in a gas station. And I thought, in the best case scenario, they’d drop all the case and send me back home as I was working illegally; and worst case scenario, they’d put me in jail, make me pay money and then send me home. So, coming back home was my option. I dropped all my classes and came back home. Please tell me what my options are. I want to complete my studies in the US and, of course, I wouldn’t do any illegal stuffs ever again.

Now, I think the best option for me to do is, go back to US, file asylum, and fight the case and hope for best result. I don’t even know how FBI works. Please Help me find a way to go back to US and live peacefully.

&#x200B;

EDIT: When I left the country, I contacted the agent, asked him if I can go back. He said, its okay for me to go because I didn't have any case on me then, and there was nothing stopping me. The case is still processing, I can go there with a new i20 and I already have the visa.

EDIT: The thing is, they had already hacked into all my accounts, they saw everything, all my codes, all the documents I did, etc. They already had everything but they came with search and seizure, took my laptops and phones is all. "
178,178,"Dog Bite: HVAC ignored k9 warning signs, took money to repair pants","I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog. Big, scary looking, but playful. 

He's gotten his ""one free bite"" out of the way after biting the UPS driver, who also ignored signs and UPS policy, by not leaving packages in the assigned area, which is one the other side of our electric fence. When my dog got close, he hit the dog with a box. Got bit. The dog never bit anyone prior, and we'd had a house with over 100+ construction workers in and our for approximately 6 months, even when we were not home. That went away.

&#x200B;

HVAC tech showed up last week, ignored the big K9 and Dogs Behind Invisible Fence signs, did not call from our driveway, got out of his vehicle, saw the dog, ran, and got nipped on the left calf bad enough to break the skin a little bit. The dog has his shots. 

Animal Control just showed up, issued a citation, told us to put the dog in in house quarantine, and settle this in court. Now this kid who got bit, said he was okay after the bite as he sat in our house, drank our water, and took the $100 offered to pay to replace his jeans. Then we called his employer who sent another tech out. That tech called from the driveway, met the dog, had no problems. And that tech went so far as saying that the kid knew better and should have called from the driveway, himself placing the blame on his counterpart. 

Now when we get to court, I'll be pleading not guilty so that I can question the kid. I did get him on audio saying that he was okay. And I wonder does him accepting the money constitute any fault on him, or relieve any liability on us. The dog is friendly, just huge. And if someone runs, it's his nature to chase and play. My concern is that this is the second time. And the bits have been triggered by an individual. 

Also, both officers from Animal Control did go out of their way to mention the conversation that they had when they pulled up to our house. And they said that because of the neighborhood that we live in, this kid was definitely going to try and sue us. And if the video camera the officer was wearing was indeed switched on, it would have caught those comments. Would that work in our favor? 

Finally, Scout managed to get out of the house, come blazing around the corner, scary looking, only to lick the officers, not bite them. And they can testify to that. But again, does it help. 

He's a very friendly, albeit big dog. Being sued because of his size and our neighborhood is a bit maddening. 

&#x200B;

The UPS driver had a shark, ambulance chaser attorney that tried to sue us for half a million for a nip that barely broke the skin, and the med bills were less than $1200.

Does following the law, having signs posted and our dogs fenced mean nothing anymore? Or anything at all? When does the responsibility get placed on people making bad decisions?"

181,181,"installed software on several PCs to make me a bit of cash, can I get in trouble? [NY]","I would consider myself to be rather skilled when it comes to programming, so I thought it would be a good way to make money. I wrote a couple of scripts to show adverts when people browsed with internet explorer. When they clicked on these ads I'd be paid.

**Note:** this doesn't harm their PCs in any way.

I couldn't think of the best way to get a lot of people to use this software so I began looking at the offices of several medium sized companies. A friend of mine mentioned his office never lock their maintenance door because it is used too often. **He was in no way complicit or new what I was going to do**.

I made sure to drive past the office quite regularly, and decided that Sunday morning would be the best time. So about 2 months ago on a Sunday morning I went inside. **I DID NOT BREAK IN, THEIR DOOR WAS UNLOCKED, I SIMPLY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN**.

I booted up a PC with a live OS from my USB drive and copied the file to the local hard drive, and arranged for a company wide email to be sent out at 10am on Monday with the title ""Office Party"" and had the software in an attachment called ""Party ideas"". When someone opened this file it would bring up a new txt file with a hashmap drawing of a party hat, and underneath it says ""Who's up for a party?"" It would also install the software I wrote in the background. I thought some people might suspect a .exe file attachment was a virus, but if word got around that i brought up a silly picture more people might open it.

Anyway, this brought in a lot more money than I thought it would, there are roughly 500 - 600 employees based at that office, with another smaller office of 200ish people. So the email I sent either went to more than the whole office or people have been spreading it around. Not that I mind of course.

I spoke to my friend again this past Saturday and he said that they've had company wide email about the attachment and that how it's a virus and is being investigated. The poor girl whose PC the emails came from is distraught apparently, and is being accused of going on NSFW websites.

I don't *think* it can be traced back to me, and even if it can I don't think i've actually done anything illegal! Their office was free for me to walk into, there was no keep out signs, and it wasn't even locked! Secondly I've not done any damage to their PCs, it purely shows ads and can be removed by using ""add / remove programs"". It is NOT malicious, it does not copy itself, or try to hide AT ALL.

Do I need a lawyer?

Can I eve get in trouble if I'm caught?

Thanks,

**EDIT:**  Again, I did not break in. I simply walked in. There was no force involved in my entry at all.

**EDIT 2:** Yes you're all very funny. But no-one has provided a valid reason why I could get into trouble for this? It's not like i stole anything, unless you count the air I breathed when I was in the office for fucks sake! Ads aren't evil, it's Google's whole business model!"

The paper is an order to hand over the dogs, and it comes from a department that doesn’t exist, signed by a person who doesn’t exist. It doesn’t threaten them with imprisonment, and my thought process is that if the department doesn’t really exist, then there’s nothing wrong. Is this legal?"

I know this one didnt get super popular but I did get a resolution and wanted to share.  After a few more phone calls trying to get to the bottom of this latest incident I decided to social engineer a bit and got what i wanted out of the latest incident.

I had set the name of my paypal proxy to something that sounded like a law firm using semi-common last names (eg: Allen, Wells, and Queen LTD) and charged invoiced $500 via debit card.  Once it posted i went into my local branch who I have an okay relationship with to make a withdrawal.  The branch manager has always been on my side with this and saw my transaction and very shyly asked if it was a legitimate transaction because it was outside my spending norm, and i informed her that was my down payment on the retainer to sue FU Bank as I had stated many times in the recent past, that was last wednesday.

Then yesterday I got a call from someone way higher up in the company than i would have expected, this individual is high up enough that their profile and picture is on the banks website.  This person listened to my story from start to end not just on the open issue but my whole experience with the bank.

The resolution we came to included fixing my dispute issue to the original resolution I wanted ($205/479 refunded, originally they gave me 479/479) plus the 2 fees waived as a result of the dispute coming back through.  They also increased my credit line on my credit card with them because they legitimately harmed my credit last summer and ive been very responsible with the card since i opened it.

I will most likely take my business elsewhere, im looking into different checking/savings solutions, but ive been advised by a few people to keep the credit card with them until my credit is more established.

To those in similar situations, One of the posters in the original thread was correct, I should have ended the banking relationship long ago.  The time, effort, and CRAP I endured for this just wasnt worth it."
189,189,[CA] Have been using my deceased mother's welfare assistance,"Okay to keep this short, my mother died recently (end of February, suicide) and her death has really taken a toll on me, emotionally and financially. I'm the primary survivor who was taking care of all the funeral arrangements. We also received donations but it was cutting it close for the cremation and viewing. She was on welfare (food stamps, cash aid) and I used her card (food stamps) last month to buy groceries. Currently the welfare office doesn't know she is deceased as I am still waiting for the death certificate, to also claim the social security money for her death (only 250 but God knows I need it after everything). I'm wondering, if they notice someone was using her card after her death, will they pursue a case? What would be the chances of them catching me? And if they did, what would I be charged for? (FYI the welfare office doesn't know my current address) 

I've had some experience with the welfare office and opening a case, someone stole my card from me and used my food stamps (renter I was living with) and I asked them to open a case, they said they would but never did. This was last year in July. I'm assuming if I manually reported a card stolen and they never opened a case, the chances of them opening a case for this might be low. Especially because the amount of people on welfare in California is massive and the welfare office is always a shit storm, busy as hell. 

I'm just in a bad spot with my mom gone, and I know some folk will say I shouldn't have used it at all to avoid this situation but if you've ever had to pay for someone's death expenses you'll know how expensive it gets. I needed it. But now I'm worried. Any advice is appreciated. "
190,190,(NJ) I want my meds back,"I was arrested in NJ for possession of CDS even though I have a prescription for the aforementioned CDS.  I am prescribed 240 a month - I had 2 on me.

Of course, I cited the NJ law that I am entitled to have 2 days worth of meds without a prescription as long as I can identify the pharmacy and doctor, but since the cops have no regard for the law or its statues they arrested me anyway. It's funny how a normal citizen knows more than our brain dead stormtroopers.

So, the charges were dropped and I want my meds back. Do I just go back to the police station?  I'm scared if I go pick it up, they will give it to me and then arrest me all over again just to be dicks.  I don't have the original physical perscritption - only the pharmacy receipt.  It's obviously legitimate though because both Superior and Municipal called my doc and verified it.

So, what should I do?  I dont really want to contact my lawyer and get juiced more money but I want my meds back.  Even though it's only 2 pills, its the point that they are mine, they were illegally confiscated and I want them back.

I have made life decisions based off of their promise to pay for my tuition, such as attending this particular community college.

My dad is 64 and has been on methodone for 30 years after becoming addicted to prescription opiates due to chronic pain from Hep C.

He hasn’t once come up with an opiate hot urine in the 30 years of being on the program and I state this because although methadone is typically used to treat addicts (which he was) it was due to trying to alleviate chronic pain.

Anyway, he recently hurt his back. He’s having unbearable sciatic nerve pain which is keeping him awake for days at a time. He has been to a local urgent care, the ER and his primary which all refuse to prescribe pain medication due to him being on methadone. 

He is allowed 2 weeks of take home bottles of methadone on his treatment program, because he was in so much pain he drank twice his daily dose and essentially ran out a week early. He was heavy into withdrawl 2 days ago and called his methadone clinic who couldn’t take him til today. 

The clinic has suspended his take homes obviously for violating the the policy and taking more than prescribed. So, he’ll be forced to go there every morning now, while in severe pain. The doctor there stated they can’t give him anymore methadone until Monday (because that’s when he was due for a refill) and the same doctor also stated it may potentially be illegal to have been denied pain meds solely based on the fact that he was on methadone and obviously and undeniable in pain. X-rays have shown 3 fractured discs which are believed by not sure to be from past injuries and clearly he has some type of pinched sciatic nerve based on the pain. 

My question is, is what his methadone doctor stated in fact true? Can he legally be denied any type of pain medication for being a patient of methadone as well? Also, like wtf? Our healthcare system is so fucked. Any advice would be appreciated!

Side Note: Thanks alot Doc, had to go buy some illegal oxys off the street just to get my dad out of fucking pain.

194,194,Research chemicals seized at customs,"I had a small shipment of research chemicals seized at customs. What should I do? They are legal if not intended for human consumption according to the analogue act. I just got a letter from border patrol saying my package was seized under 19 USC 1595a(c)(1)(b), 21 USC 952, 21 USC 813, 19 CFR 162.45a. OH, USA. Package was seized in California. Should I forfeit my property (one of the options given on my letter)? It should be legal. Should I be worried about being investigated or charged with something?

EDIT: I came here for legal advice, not to be harassed with unhelpful and derogatory comments. I doubt any of you people are even lawyers or involved with the law given how vague and ambiguous your ""advice"" was."
195,195,Mild child abuse?,"A friend of mine was caught doing something that her parents disapproved of (it wasn’t anything illegal). As punishment, her parents decided to refuse her food or water starting from 3:00 PM to around 9 or 10 PM that day. I know this may seem mild but the friend was continuously telling me she was very hungry and had to sneak away a cup of water when she got too thirsty. She says this is the first time they’ve done this and that they apologized afterwards. I just need to know if this is something I should report or not. Thank you for taking the time to read this; I hope it doesn’t sound like a dumb question.

EDIT: Thank you all for reassuring me this definitely *does* sound like a dumb question.

Also, I suppose this bit wasn’t made clear enough but a major concern of mine was that I did not know when she had last eaten or had water beforehand; the punishment simply started at 3:00. It was evident by her stealing of water that she had not had water quite a while before 3:00.

Also, I have learned that she only had a banana that morning which may have been cause for the hunger complaints.

Nevertheless, it seems this is something that does not call for a report to CPS. Thank you for your answers."
196,196,UPDATE: My Son's School is Enforcing a Discriminatory Dress Code,"Previously, when I explained the school's discriminatory dress code - ""Boys hair cannot be longer than their shirt collar,"" the reddit community was a huge help. Thanks to everyone for their feedback and input. This is in the Southern District of Texas (USA) at an anonymous school in an anonymous school district. There are 500 of 1276 school districts (40%) that continue to enforce a discriminatory dress code despite not providing a justification.

We reviewed the school policy and legal cases, prepared an argument, and submitted a grievance with the administration. We cited the school policy which prohibits discrimination and even pointed to the section of the school policy which forbids harassment of students based on gender stereotypes or students not conforming to gender stereotypes as well as Title IX. Apparently that portion of the student policy and Federal legislation is not as important as ""asserting authority"" and ""identifying students that don't belong in the community.""

At the recommendation of our fellow redditors, we talked with an ACLU attorney and a local family law attorney who both said, the school has made it impossible to stop the hair policy and the costs to fight in court would be extraordinarily prohibitive. The policy specifically states, anyone not in compliance with the dress code will be placed on In School Suspension (ISS) during the grievance process and will remain in ISS until their hair is in compliance. At our grievance meeting the principal emphasized that the school response to the grievance would take the full 10 business days, during which time the student will remain in ISS. We requested an exemption and the principal informed us that he was the one who approved exemptions, that there were only religious or cultural exemptions, and that we would not qualify for an exemption under any circumstances.  Our son has had to drop one course already because he could not attend mandatory peer group meetings, missing those mandatory meetings last week meant that he could not achieve a passing grade in the course.

We ask for your support as we will be reaching out to the school board next. If you have any background information that supports our arguments against discriminatory school dress codes, you can help with a case citation and a short summary. Try not to duplicate cases that have already been cited, although a reply if the analysis is off or if their are additional points to ponder would be very helpful. If the case is no longer precedential, that information would also be helpful. Additionally, any research or articles that review the effects of either hair cut  or ISS policies. I am looking for information and citations I can cut and paste into an appeal.

The haircut is not trivial for us, our son has been growing his hair for 5 years. His hair is literally midway down his back (24 inches). He cannot cut it now and grow it back next summer, this portion of his identity will be permanently removed and cannot be replaced.  Growing it back again after high school will likely not achieve the same look and style.

Thank you Reddit community for your support - see you in the comments."
197,197,19 year old charged with DUI (Idaho),"I was arrested last night for a misdemeanor DUI and misdemeanor open container. I am a first time offender aside from speeding tickets. I blew a 0.160. I was not rude or an ass in any way. I was respectful throughout the whole ordeal and made sure I made the officers job as easy as possible. I am worried that I will lose my license and in turn lose my job and also not be able to attend college because of this. Is it worth getting a lawyer? Will getting a lawyer help me with hopefully getting the DUI charge expunged or dropped? 
Edit: I am going to an attorney tomorrow morning to consult with them"
198,198,Can i (17f) get fired in Texas for disclosing my sexuality/talking about my partner with kids that I work with.,"So i live in the suburbs near houston and I would say my community is fairly split between conservative and liberal.  However, I still live in texas and we all know Texas isn't the most gay-friendly state.  I work at a gym teaching young kids (5-15ish) gymnastics.  As a coach i often develop close relationships w my kids (not in a weird way i just love them and care for them), and they will constantly ask me questions about my personal life.  They've asked me if I have a boyfriend, who I'm going to prom with, and who has the other half of a ""friendship"" keychain I have, and I'm always honest with them and tell them I have a girlfriend.  I won't give them details (they've asked if we've kissed before, if I'd marry a girl, etc.) but I won't lie.  I've almost never brought it up myself (there's a group of 11-15 year olds who I told without being prompted, but they were having a conversation about lesbians so I chimed in) and only tell them about my girlfriend if they ask.  I'm worried someone might tell their parents and bring it up to my management.  Is it legal for me to talk to kids about it?  Is it legal for my managers to tell me not to talk about it?  I don't want to get fired or face but I also don't want to work somewhere where I'm discriminated against, even if it's for my own protection.  All of my coworkers that know are totally cool with it (or at least I think they are and I don't really care if they don't) and I've never tried to hide it or lie, but I don't think I've explicitly told my manager or the owner of the gym.  Thanks in advance!"
199,199,"I haven't done anything at my office job for 2 months, and my boss found out. The clients we work with are pissed because nothing is being done.

200,200,[NJ] Fired for calling the cops,"I work in a closing retail store, today was our last day and members of management and some of the other associates, including underage girls, talked often about drinking once we had closed our doors. I voiced my opinion multiple times about it being a bad idea as they obviously have to drive home afterwards. During the course of the day I did indeed found alcohol which I moved in an effort to keep them from drinking and driving. Once we did close however it seems one associate still have alcohol on their person and they were all intending to do shots before leaving. I again iterated how this was a bad idea before leaving. I wound up calling the cops to come check it out and I am being fired as a result. I should mention that there is still 2 weeks of cleaning and removing stuff from the store. Should I speak to an employment lawyer?"
201,201,Father charged me with credit card theft with card HE gave me.,"Long story short, my Father's a multi-millionaire, sperm donor, piece of sh!t. I graduated high school and began University. My Father always promised as long as I maintained good grades and stayed out of trouble, my college and expenses would be taken care of. Fast forward into my sophomore year, my Mother divorced him. In retaliation to my mother, not only did my Father drop his financial obligation (that he promised) he accused me of credit card theft on a card he provided me. The card I was issued had a infinite limit on it. My Father cut off all financial help and left me entirely destitute. In vengeance and great regret, I paid my vehicle (which was in his name) off  and my college tuition on the credit card for that semester which totaled $30,000. 

It's been 12 years of hell and oppression. Im a 32 year old, single female that have made pretty decent decisions with my life and have no other convictions of ANY sort. NOT even traffic violations. I've battled guilt and humiliation from being a felon on paper. 

I was placed on deferred adjudication with 3 years probation. I was released a year and a half early for good behavior. I filed an order for non-disclosure it was granted in 2016. Its been 10 years since the arrest date.

Can anybody chime in on what my record may look like now? Does it show that it was deferred or is it entirely sealed. Much Love and thanks"
202,202,[MA] BANNED FROM SMASH BROS,"I was BANNED from my local super smash bros melee scene. They use the local community college to host this and TOLD ME BY EMAIL IF I CAME THERE THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME IN. This was out of nowhere so I immediately called the TO, who told me why. He said it was because I was frequently toxic and angry. He said that I yell at players and make them uncomfortable and scared, and that a girl quit because of me. While I DO sometimes get frustrated and vocalize it, so do many other people I am simply being discriminated against my voice is naturally deeper than most. also the truth is a girl never quit that is a complete lie, she was just butthurt that she was worst than everyone there. I'm so fucking irate. I've been a member of this community FOR YEARS and just now I'm a nuisance? I am entitled to a certain level of RESPECT for being a veteran player. I'm looking into finding a lawyer who get me unbanned. There MUST be a law that prevents people from arbitrarily banning others from certain locations without written documents proving it (the TO just SAID I was banned he did not provide any evidence.) The TO isn't rich or anything so I don't think I would have to ask a lot from him, I think he'd break under just pressure of lawsuit. "

204,204,How can I manuver my way into getting my dad's apartment before my mother? (NYC),"Hi everybody. Throwaway account for privacy reasons. I'm going to make this short and brief. 

My mother has been a constant toxic presence in my life. She has had things handed to her for most of her life and doesn't understand the value of money. It's because of this - combined with a plethora of other reasons - that I don't want her in my life anymore. 

My father's name is on the lease and is the only one on the lease. He claims that it was impossible to add my mother's name in the past which is why it's only him. 

He left my mother after putting up with her bullshit for over 20 years and does not plan on paying the rent for her to stay. He will however pitch in so I can stay - and we both want the apartment to become mine.

I've tried to speak with her reasonably and told her that it's only logical for me to get the apartment since I have a stable job and she doesn't. She also has other options like moving in with my brother who needs a caregiver for his children, or moving back to Dominican Republic and live in house my father had built. She then told me that according to a government representative she spoke to earlier on the phone, she has a right to stay in the apartment even if she doesn't pay the rent because she's been here for decades and since she can't pay the rent due to ""circumstances"" the government will cover her. 
 
I looked up options for me and ""succession rights"" popped up but I have no idea where to start. I want to cover my tracks and make sure that I do this as fast as possible so I can legally kick her out and move on with my life. 

If this post is too short I will be more than happy to edit it and dive into all the little details. I honestly have no experience or knowledge of the law besides the bare minimum so I don't even know what information you guys might need in this situation. 

Thanks.

Sorry for format and any grammatical errors - I'm on mobile. 

Edit #1: I forgot to mention that my mother forgot her documents (permanent resident card and other important documents) in a bank and took over a month to get them back which resulted in them getting destroyed. Is it possible that she can get deported if I decide to take her to court?

Edit #2: I cannot afford the rent by myself - I plan on having a roommate come live with me. As a result I can't have my mother living here anymore. So it's not just that I don't want to live with her anymore even though I don't - it's also that I can't. "
205,205,Two women at work dislike one of the owners so they want to unionize to push their personal agendas. Should I talk to the owners? How can I protect my job?,"I live in Europe (Spain). Small company (18 employees) on IT. I’ve been here for 5 years, have a good salary, and I really enjoy my job. I’m also about to buy a house here, so things are going great.

Two women joined us less than two years ago and came from big companies. They came to work with us so they could stay close to their homes and “settle”. They are both kind of slow and, sorry to say it, bad at their job. One of them is even aware of it and purposely decided to avoid learning. Both of them had a bad time with one of the two partners (owners), so they both fought to get re-assign to work far from him.

In my country, after a certain number of employees, we can unionize; we actually choose a union rep internally and formalize the new state of affairs within the company. Because of their troubles fitting in, these two want to proceed with the union and use the new state of affairs to ask from the partners a bunch of crap that’s just gonna cause trouble.

The real reasn is that they want to take power away from them so that the new “order” can benefit their way of working instead of trying to fit the company culture. 

They both work 5 min away from the office, but they want “flexible hours” so they can come in at 8 and get out at 17 (instead of 9-18); they want the option to work remotely one day a week; they want to review tons of comapny rules that are clear just for the sake of it, etc.

And to top it off, one of them said that “the idea is to tell the owners that they can no longer manage the company the way they once did”. They basically want to take control away from the partners, protecting themselves from getting fired and chsnging somethin that works but doesn’t suit their vision.

Now, hear me out. The workplace is great and the partners are always flexible and accomodating to reasonable requests. These two wanna use us (employees) as a shield to get back at one of the partners for “not treating them as well as a they deserve”, to the point of accusing one of being mysogynistic (50% of employees are women, only these two accuse him of that).

All of this is gonna cause trouble, and I won’t back them up in any way. In fact, I talked to the poster-girl the other day and played it dumb in order to find out what she wanted to do. She opened up, and I proceeded to tear down (diplomatically) all her stupid requests and explained why those would cause more harm than good, given, btw, that one of them was working from home while she lived at 5 fucking minutes from there...

Entitlement was everywhere. They just don’t get that they can’t do this without tearing down the good thing that we have at the moment, and the fact the two most useless team members are promoting this is a huge red flag. Why do I have to shit on the partners’ trust so that whinny coworker and useless employee can feel “respected as people” and screw off at home one day a week?

As expected, they vented like crazy behind my back afterwards. I want this job, I don’t want two of essentially newcommers to ruin this, so what should I do? Should oppose them openly? Should I warn the partners so they can divide them or take some sort of action? Again, I don’t want that these two cause enough mayhem a that my job is somehow compromised.

One of them, btw, admitted that “she wouldn’t really starve if she wasn’t working”, meaning she can affort to act like this.

Finally, the situation with the partners is as follows: owner A (really socialist, gave these two women tons of chances to fit in) told me in the past not to talk about employees issues with owner B, as he would overreact. Owner B (hardass, down to business kind of guy, less of a people’s person, wants people to work and do a good job) is the guy these two women have issues with.

My options are:

**a)** talk to partner A and risk inaction. He would let this be, in my opinion, long enough for it to become a problem.

**b)** talk to partner B, put things into motion and risk pisisng off the other guy by “defying” him and his decision.

**c)** set up a meeting with both and tell them I have serious information regarding the company and the future of it, and that I will share it with them both if that’s what they want.

The problem is not the union, and the woman in charge already requested the owners for office space to meet, so it’s in the open. The problem is that she admitted in private that she’s doing it to take power away from them and change things to fit their vision, and the owners don’t know this.

First union meeting is in about two weeks. How would you protect yourself against this? How would you stop these women from using a perfectly valid tool (the union) to ruin something good (our job)?"
206,206,"Charged with a felony, will it stick?","  I was pulled over out of town for “speeding” by a K-9 unit. (I wasn’t speeding, our car reads speed limit signs), but in addition to that, the officer said our 30-day plate numbers weren’t legible. (They were, plate is in perfect condition). As soon as they pulled us, they come to the car, and made us step out of the car in freezing weather, and stand behind our car in the parking lot.

  About 15 minutes pass, I call my mom and let her know what’s going on, after 5 more minutes, officers get out and tell me to place my hands behind my back, and that I’m under arrest for a Communicating Threats charge (no warrant) from my home town. I was and still am genuinely confused, as I don’t know who took these papers on me. I have the name of the person, but I don’t know them.

  Anyways, 3 more police cars pull up, they pat me down, take my phone (which is still on call with my mother). They come back to me in the back of the police car, and tell me “I’m a K-9 Unit, and I am going to do a routine K-9 search on the vehicle, if he hits, we are searching it, okay?” & I don’t respond. Long story short, they search the car, find a “substance” where I was sitting, and another where my bf was sitting. They open the hood, trunk, all doors, and tear it apart, and find nothing else.

  At this point, my mother is still listening in, officers do not realize. They speak to my boyfriend, and once she hears them speaking very suspiciously, she starts recording the call from her end. The officers are speaking about who will testify to what, and at one point, the main officer says “I’ll testify to (xxx), we will say we pulled them because of this, and I’ll say I was driving, because I REALLY was driving”. It’s very suspicious, and it’s all on recording. They intentionally left their body cameras off, and on the recording, the main officer says “okay, turn your body cam on now”. 

  At this point, they come to me, still in the car, tell me they’re charging me with Felony Possession, read me my rights, then ask me what the substance is, and try to get me to incriminate myself through empathy, saying “we need to know what it is, so we don’t hurt ourselves”. I tell them, being the empath that I am, “I don’t know what it is, but don’t touch it. I take full responsibility for anything in the vehicle” he asks me the same question again, I respectfully decline to answer anymore questions without my attorney present. Officer says “well that answers that” laughs, and slams the door in my face.

  In the recording, just after this, he claims I admitted it was “dope” by telling them not to touch it. They take me to the magistrate, and leave me in the car for close to an hour, then the magistrate comes out, reads me my bond, and charges, then I’m taken to jail and booked. Any advice on this? Body cams intentionally left off during search, officers conspiring with the body cams off, pulling us over without any real reason.

EDIT: I’d also like to add, me and my boyfriend are in our 20’s, don’t look like criminals, weren’t driving a suspicious looking vehicle."

212,212,Repo guy harassing my 12 year old at our front door?,"To start we are located in WI.
My 12 year old son takes band class at his school. He is in percussion and required a bell kit to keep at home for practice. Through a local music store they rent them out (rent to own basically) and we had been making payments (automatic) every month. We knew we only had a few payments left to make before it was paid off in full. We received zero monthly statements from the company, and we never really thought anything about the payments stopping because we thought it had been paid off. Again- nothing ever came in the mail. I never answer my cell phone to numbers I don’t recognize because of scam/telemarketing etc. so if they called I wouldn’t have answered. (Leave  a message if you know me. I had not received any emails from the music store, and if did they went to spam and I never saw them. 
Which brings us to about 15min ago. I had just gotten out of the shower and the doorbell rings. My son is home because there is a school snow day because of the weather. He answers the door and a man is asking for me. My son says I’m not available and the man took a sarcastic tone like”Oh really, are you sure about that?”
Again- I had just stepped out of the shower so I can hear the whole exchange. This man then asks “are you xxx?” I was shocked a stranger knew my kid’s name. My son said yes, and the man told him that I had not been paying the company for the bell kit, and went into details that I couldn’t hear- but it was obviously something a 12 year old would not know about financially etc. My son told him he thought it was paid off and the man starts writing down my son’s “statement” (his words) and said that he was going to have to go back to the store to see if that was true or not. He then said “xxxx, this is the part of my job I hate, but we are now considering this as theft and I will be reporting your mother to the Sheriff’s office.” My 12 year old just stood there shellshocked, and the man said he was taking his statement to the store and if it didn’t check out the sheriff was going to be contacted. To add insult to injury- my son knows this man as he is the school’s band substitute teacher and sees him frequently. 
I called my husband at work and told him what had just happened- and he immediately called the music store and paid the bill in full. I am thinking the card used for autopay had expired, and all they needed was a new card number. Shouldn’t they have contacted us by mail? And is it even legal to confront a 12 yr old and tell him basically his mom was going to be charged for theft and to expect a Sheriff’s officer to come to the house? My  son is traumatized, I am livid and my husband chewed out the store about not contacting by mail. (He did not mention the part about the information being passed to a child.)
Do I drop it for the sake that my son has to interact frequently with this man or is there action I should take?
In my mind if they tried to get ahold of me by phone and left no messages, and emails I didn’t get- anything that would have had the law on their side would have to be letter by mail, which was never done. To confront a 12 yr old at our house is unacceptable to me and I want to know if he was in the legal right to do so. 

Edit: Thanks for the answers! I would never dispute or not make a payment for something I clearly owe money for. I wouldn’t care if it was 5 cents- it is my responsibility and clearly through an oversight we dropped the ball. I have never had a late payment on anything as I always use auto payment straight from our account. I just would have thought a letter in the mail would have brought it to our attention instead of a home visit...which is fine if that is how they choose to proceed- I was miffed that my son was involved and that’s why I was a bit taken aback. Now I know that it is within their right- I’ll just go back to being mortified that this happened at all, and make sure all debit cards that we have for auto pay are up to date. I appreciate the responses!"
213,213,Am I legally obligated to pay for a credit card that I was forced to open against my will?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 21 y/o college student with no credit, last time I checked-- or possibly bad credit, now, after having been delinquent on my old apt's electric bill now for a few months (I heard utilities don't count towards credit?) and this situation with a credit card. I am mostly asking about the credit card because I'm embarrassed and no one knows the truth and I don't know what to do-- I relapsed after a few years off of street drugs last year and in November my dealer took me, intoxicated, to Home Depot where he forced me to go inside and use all my real information to apply for an on-the-spot credit card. LUCKILY I was only approved for $500 since I am a 21 y/o with no credit (wahoo!) He proceeded to use the temporary card (the paper receipt) and my signature to max out all $500 on it so he could put it towards a fridge or whatever while he gave me drugs to keep me occupied and get high in the bathroom so I stayed under the influence, roaming around the store after consenting to I guess and showing them my ID for the transaction. All I remember was that we were in that store for hours.. This is both embarrassing and shameful on my part and no one knows that it happened. Now the Home Depot wants min. payment of $25 a month and I was going to call them to explain how I was forced to do this (he had a gun) but I'm not willing to take it to the police (I can't even track down the dealer) and just don't want any trouble. I'm thinking at this point it may just be easier to pay for the $500 balance, with this first payment having been received late, and since I truly did walk into the store and open the card with my ID, my social, my everything, I legally gotta pay and it's just a consequence of my usage. On the other hand, someone theoretically could have walked into the store with my documents and info that looked like me? Can anyone advise? Thanks very much and I apologize if this is in the wrong sub! EDIT: This happened in Philly, PA but I'm from Boston with a Mass ID and address."
214,214,International adoption?,"Hello everybody. I'm in the process of adopting a child from a non Hague Convention country. I am currently overseas completing the final adoption/negotiation with the parents. Afterwards I understand that I need a IR-3 Visa to be issued for the child and then I take her home with me.  Am I missing any paperwork or legal stuff?  I know the government likes to have a mountain of paperwork to do anything so I just wanna make sure all my bases are covered.  We're going to be living in Utah.  Thanks.

EDIT: I HAVE SPOKEN TO A LOCAL LAWYER AND WE HAVE DECIDED THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO HAVE HER APPLY FOR ASYLUM AS A POLITICAL REFUGEE.  SHE WILL COME BACK WITH OUR MISSIONARY GROUP AND LIVE AT MY HOME IN UTAH. THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE EVERYONE."
215,215,"[MA] Landlord has my last month rent (no security) and sends me message: ""there is a problem, you smoked in the apartment, only way to fix it is changing carpets and repainting walls. How do you intend to solve the problem?""","I had a 9 months lease with my landlord and moved out early, after agreeing with him that I would have honored my rental obligations until a new tenant was found. He does have my last month rent, no security deposit, and I do have written proof of it on my contract. I did pay the rent of what turned out to be the last month because I did not know when a new tenant would show up. 


The realty company found a new tenant from April 1st, and I have already vacated the apartment. Today my landlord sent me a text message saying that there is a problem, I smoked in the apartment (the lease says not to) and the only way to fix it is changing carpets and repainting the walls. He asks me how do I intend to deal with the problem. I am yet to reply deciding what my best course of action is. I assume he entered the apartment without giving me any notice, and technically I paid the rent until the end of the month. I washed the apartment quite thoroughly (all surfaces disinfected, floors cleaned, carpets vacuumed twice).


And yes, I did smoke (tobacco) in the apartment in the last months. But (a) I'm a light smoker, maybe smoked 10 cigarettes in the last month in there; (b) have not been smoking in the apartment at all for at least a week. (so there is no objective damage like stains on the walls or similar). I did cook in there on a daily basis and even burned a few steaks in case it counts, lol. 


My current plan of action is to give him a call, not admitting to smoking in the apartment (but just outside the door - maybe that is what he smells? Lease does not prohibit me from stepping outside the house to smoke, that is actually what my landlord suggested when I moved in) but offering to shampoo the carpets and wash the walls if he deems it appropriate. 


He has no proof (that I can think of) of my smoking, plus it is my understanding that he cannot use my last month as security, and must return it to me within 30 days of my move.

I think he wants to keep my money, and generally speaking, I'd prefer to solve the thing amicably rather than going to court. What do you advise? Thanks!



Edit: This is how it rolled out. 


I talked to my landlord, offered alternatives (with links to sources) to repainting the whole house, and he accepted to give it a try. I deep washed the carpets and washed the walls, by hand, with a solution of ammonia, white vinegar, washing soda and warm water. 


He looked at the place a few days after I was done, said all was well, and gave me back my money. 


Total cost: 60$ for Dr. Rug and related washing soaps; ~40$ of ammonia, vinegar and bleach resistant cloth for the walls and ~12 hours of my time.

216,216,"""Nightmare house guest"" or ""Sexually Abused Female Victim Trapped In A House""","HELP! I am a 30 year old, in California homeless sexually abused female with no money and no family. I have been abused my entire life on and off by many different men, including my own father. 

In the beginning of January someone who I considered a friend allowed me to stay at his house. Almost immediately, he began to rub my breasts and buttocks. I told him not to touch me but he continued. I tried to keep it to myself thinking that he was only being affectionate and maybe I shouldn't be such a prude. Around the beginning of February, whenever he moved close to me, I would quickly find something to do, usually cleaning common spaces such as the kitchen and dining area, which I kept spotless for the most part. He became visably upset that I'd walk away from him and began to isolate me inside the house. The house is very far away from public transit and I have no car. He made sure to conveniently forget to take me grocery shopping or into the city for appointments. I was trapped in the house for 3 weeks straight, terrified that he would come into the room and try to rape me or worse. He triggered a horrible PTSD panic attack within me by leaving his used sex toys out in the bathroom. After this, I didn't leave the bedroom unless it was an emergency. As a defense mechanism, whenever I feel as though I am in danger I always make a barricade around myself and my sleeping area out of my belongings. It's my own secret trap meant to literally trip up potential assailants because they wouldn't know the terrain but I would so I would be able to escape easily while my abuser got stuck.

I was convinced by an ex-mutual friend to speak to him again about my boundaries. When I did he purposely triggered my PTSD and called the police to have me 5150'd... during my time under doctor supervision (3 days) I was informed that I was suffering from a light mood disorder but my real problem was my sexually abusive living situation... After I got out, I was informed that he was either thinking of or already in the process of filing a restraining order and police report on me. For what reasons, I had no idea at the time because I had never done anything other than be kind and shut my mouth about his sexual abuse... But then I saw this post on imgur... http://imgur.com/a/pXOtw

Most of the things in the captions are false. The weed bag was planted and I NEVER harmed any of the animals... He hurt the animals himself in order to blame me!!! This is HORRIBLE! Not only is he trying to hurt me now he's hurting innocent creatures!!!

I already filed a police report as soon as I got out of the psychiatric ward/crisis center/whatever as well as a restraining order... but I believe he might have pressed false charges on me while I was under 5150 and had three days of my life stolen.

What can I do in this situation??? He's going out of his way to create false evidence and physically hurt others in order to bring me down... I don't know what to do and I don't have the money... PLEASE help!!!

EDIT: I already moved out. I need serious help sorting through the legal bullshit. Also this is what the 5150 release paperwork said that I suffer from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia

217,217,I think my grandma killed my dad,"Not a troll post 

So when I was 10 my dad died, I'm now 19 and I am thinking of taking legal action to find out the truth. 3 days after my 10 birthday my mom got a call saying my dad died. My sister 11 at the time, her and my mom went over to my grandmother's house the day after it happened ( my dad died at her house). My sister 11 went in alone she said she saw pills all over the house and our grandma was grabbed my sister and tried telling her our mom was the reason our dad died/ committed suicide. The day before our dad's funeral my other sister we will call her k, so k and our grandma went to the funeral home to see the body and everything. Our grandma took k by the hand and made her touch our dad's body even tho she didn't want to, and the day of the funeral me and my sister went allowed to the funeral because our mom was with us and I feel like I was wronged I was only 10 and my dad dies and telling us we can't go because you don't want our mom there really messed me up. So a few years pass and I ask my sister what happened. So k told me that our dad hung himself with our grandma's belt in the living room by the door while our grandma was in the shower not even 15 feet away, that detail always stuck by me. Shortly after dad died our grandmother sold all of our dad's stuff in a yard sale and we don't have any keep sakes from him. We cut off all contact from her and moved around a lot, when I turned 18 I learned that I got money from my dad's death and I couldn't get it because my grandma wouldn't give it to up in the mail or anything and I'm wanting legal advice on what I should do. I want the truth on my dad's death."

219,219,Employer Trying to Charge for Classes After Putting in Two Weeks,"Hi All,

Michigan:

I recently put in my two weeks notice at my job and got an email from HR saying I was going to be charged for a six sigma course I had taken in 2018 because I had not completed 12 months of consecutive employment after completing the training.

The clause in the contract they are referring to is this:

**If you voluntarily terminate employment with *company name* after completion of the course and prior to completing 12 consecutive months of active employment, you will refund the entire amount of the training expenses provided to you**

To me this does not specify that the 12 months had to be after the training was completed and I meet this requirement as I have worked for the company for over 2 years.

What should my next moves be?

**UPDATE:** I found a section in the employee handbook that says **""The educational assistance program applies to individuals who have been employed with *company name* for a continuous 2,000 hours of service (approximately 1 year.)**

It says nothing about employment requirements after the course is completed. Does this not further reinforce my position?

**UPDATE 2: I was able to negotiate with them to reduce the amount to 25% of the original amount, thank you to everyone who didnt down vote me into oblivion.**"
220,220,Coworker who was having visa issues was promoted for a project I mostly implemented. My promotion was delayed.,"So I have a coworker who partnered with me on a major project and did about 25% of the work (He came into the project late).  We are in the same role and rank but I have been with the company for a bit longer.  I also led said project.

I recently learned he was having visa issues and could no longer stay in the US so they made a higher level job for him in our Canada office.  I was also told that my promotion process which was scheduled for this year was being delayed until next year.  When management announced his promotion they mentioned this project.  I am a US citizen and don't need a visa.

I brought this up to my manager and he said it's concerning but unrelated as they had to do something to keep him employed. But it doesn't mean that *I* deserve a promotion.  He said that I was a better performer but this decision wasn't performance related it was just a lucky draw because of his situation.  He also said that visas are really hard to deal with and that it's harder being an immigrant so I don't have the same problems as he does.  I got a bit emotional and teary eyed over this so I just asked to talk about it next week and he offered to see if the promotion could be moved up to this year.

Is this legal at all?   It's frustrating doing all this work and then seeing someone else get a promotion.  I agree with the attempt to keep him but it came at my expense.

Kratom has helped me get off methadone, I have bulging disks in my lower back and sometimes I can't even get up or move around without kratom. I was even told to stop taking VITAMINS. she said i am not allowed to take ANY HERBAL SUPPLEMTNS. This was not in my original contract for probation,
and in fact, goes directly against a group therapy I go too (court ordered) where they gave me a huge bottle of fish oil and am supposed to take it regularly. well now, just on a whim, i cant. 

i have not been failing UAs, ive done everything i was asked to do except i missed like 2 meetings or came late, no excuse but I have severe insomnia and sometimes cant stay awake during the day because I cant sleep at night. They said my next step will be some sort of impatient treatment. which is bullshit. theres so much i have to do including get ready for a job and other things.

they are on their way now to CONFISCATE my kratom. I told them I will do so much worse if they make me stop. they didnt care. They are literally doing this on a whim, claiming that since ive been taking kratom ive been way out of sorts and cant function. ive been taking it for three years. you know my im out of sorts? because i have PTSD, anxiety they wont give me anything useful for, insomnia and my meds dont help, i have nightmares everynight and im fatigued alot. kratom is one of the only things that keeps me STABLE through all that. they are making a huge, possible even illegal mistake. so can i eat a fucking salad? thats a plant too. can i not eat chili with any herbs or spices in it? so no more melatonin, or fish oil that the same judge sent me to where the group told me to take it. 

this goes against literally everything that mental health treatment has told me so far. I cant even take VITAMIN C?!?

and they think this is going to help me? kratom is like the only thing that gets my by each day.

228,228,"My roommate changed internet password and refuses to give it up, need help asap","Hey all

I have unfortunately gotten my self into a situation with a roommate who is honestly both the dumbest person I’ve ever met and also the pettiest. 

I signed an agreement on may 9th because I was in a situation with my ex girlfriend where I had to move out asap and this is the only place I could find kn short notice that was within budget as well as cat friendly. 

I signed an agreement to pay half utilities and half internet as well has half rent which was 1300 supposedly. 

Fast forward to July 8th there is a late payment notice on the door. I had paid my half of the rent early as she had asked, and asked her if everything was ok. She said she was figuring it out, and I offered to pay the remainder of what she didn’t have so the rent would be paid which was $200. 

I was supposed to leave july 21st to NY so I asked her if she had enough to cover her half of the rent for august. Apparently that was crossing a line. I then asked to see the bills for the past 3 months as she never requested a payment, and also a copy of the lease

Turns out the lease isn’t in her name. It’s her ex boyfriends. I know. Silly me. I also find out that rent is only $1260 so I’ve been paying $20 more every month. So she owes me $260 which I told her to deduct the cost of the power and internet which from the bills j received was roughly $358 total. So $184 each? Idk whatever

Basically I’ve found a new place that’s available September 1st. My agreement is supposed to go til October 31st but one of the stipulations is paying the rent on time which she did not do. She also lied about the cost of the apartment. 

So, having to had stayed another month unfortunately, we’ve agreed I’ll be out of here by 9/9. And then this bitch decides to change the password on the internet, even though I’ve gone out of my way to avoid her petty bullshit. 

So I took the router and locked it in my room and told her that She can either pay me back the money I’m owed or give me the password. She’s threatening to call the police and I said that’s fine. 

Am I legally allowed to do this? I’ve technically paid my half of power and internet and this has now put me in position where 8 of my guppies have died since the smart plug it was attached to was on the wifi, and when she cut the internet the heater went out. 

What do???"

So. I did a dumb thing and started fluffing tips at work (""accidentally"" entering an extra 0 on a $1.00 tip etc...) - I was caught apparently. My managers put me on the schedule for a weird ass time, and I got a few text messages from coworkers warning me they planned to call for my arrest me when I came in.

So... I panicked and fled out of state to stay with a friend. I am currently home & jobless though for now I have food and shelter. I'm applying for jobs as well.

My questions are:

1) What am I looking at if I returned to Dallas and faced the music? How much money / jail time etc... ? What factors play into this? Assume my old employer actually went through with pressing charges I guess. I'd really rather just deal with this honestly, though depending on the consequences that may not be my best option yeah?

2) Is not facing the music a realistic option? Like how does having a warrant out for you across state borders play out? Is there a way for me to find out if I actually have one out for me? 

3) Say I returned to Dallas, briefly, to retrieve my things - what is the likelihood of me being caught and arrested if I were to fly in? If I drove in?

4) ...any references on some way to hire a retrieval service to get my shit for me? Assuming I couldn't go myself.

I regret my decision, obviously. It's not like I was stealing for the thrill or for fun, I was stealing cause grocery money. I was and am effectively homeless, have been for quite some time.

230,230,To Pepper Spray a Pit Bull or Not to Pepper Spray a Pit Bull,"Several months ago my 18 lb dog was attacked by an 80 lb pit bull.  The pit bull picked him up in his mouth, but luckily did not bite down.  Since then I started carrying pepper spray.  Yesterday I was walking my dog and noticed a guy about 200 feet away telling is dog to ""stay here with me.""  I was walking on a sidewalk that would take me within about 20 feet of where they were standing.  I picked up my dog and continued walking.  As I approached the pit bull began to pull the man towards me.  I pulled out my pepper spray and yelled ""DO NOT LET THAT DOG GET CLOSE TO ME.""  Sadly, the dog did not understand a word I said, and continued pulling the man closer to me.  When they were within about 4 feet I gave them one last warning, ""GET THAT DOG AWAY FROM ME OR I'M GOING TO SPRAY HIM!!!!""  Finally the dog stopped pulling.  We were able to escape without spraying the dog.  

I told a friend of mine about this today.  He said if I had sprayed the pit pull I might get charged with assault with a dangerous weapon.  I replied that I didn't think dogs had those kinds of rights, and that I was not going to allow my dog to die.  

I live in Massachusetts.  If I feel I am in immediate danger of being attacked by a dog, could I get in trouble if I spray the dog with pepper spray?  Thanks in advance for your help!"

Long story short, I have confirmed that the apartment lobby security my friend lives in is reporting to non police whenever she leaves or enters her apartment for financial gain. The solution isn't as easy as telling the building manager about the issue... she doesn't really want to go the legal path. I told her she can move, but she feels like she is letting the haters win by doing that.

She just wants to live without the feeling of being watched and betrayed by the security. I know people will ask ""what evidence""? It's best to not say on here as it took months to gather, and she has proven this to me to be correct.

I know some who read this will feel skeptical and assume she is paranoid. I was skeptical in the beginning as well, but there are a few ways to prove this and in fact, she was correct.

233,233,"My lawyer is suing me, need advice","Does anyone know an experienced lawyer who could give me some advice? (Location Virginia/Washington DC)

Basically, I hired this lawyer to help me settle a dispute with my former business partners who owed me a large amount of money (landlord was also involved). 

It really was a mess, however my lawyer definitely had unconscious bias and didn’t do the minimum in advocating for me. Ultimately it costs me thousands of dollars as the landlord walked away with a $50,000 lump sum from my ex-partners while I walked away with $50,000 divided monthly over 4 years. 

My ex-partners have a lot of money mind you and they could have easily cut me a check while they were busy cutting the landlord a check but my lawyer was negotiating this $50,000 / 4 years settlement when he should have started the negotiations at a lump sum settlement. Gross negligence/incompetence and unconscious bias in my book.  

So now after already having paid my lawyer $8,000 and having ignored his continued requests for monthly payments during covid, he’s now asking for a further $17,000 and has filed a complaint with the circuit court against me. 

I was never once given a statement of services. Just signed an engagement letter (to charge hourly) and gave him a retainer. Not once did he sent me a statement of services until I received the lawsuit I didn’t even know how much I owed him. 

Is this his last ditch attempt to scare me into giving him something? Should I threaten him with a counter-malpractice suit or is that fruitless? I’m not sure what to do I’m financially in a bind as I’m still paying back the original loan for the business that I took out and have to now deal with this lawyer. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Danke."
234,234,"Vermont: Realty agent/company refusing to provide bank information, now being threatened with a 14 day notice to pay or be evicted.","Vermont. I rented a home at the beginning of July through a realty company. My lease states verbatim ""Rent may be paid by check, cashier's check, bank draft, or money order"".

Despite politely hounding the realty company via email, phone calls, and in person at their office, they failed to get me the bank info by the end of July/first of August. So I paid via money order because I didn't want issues and it wasn't too much skin off my back.

However, now that the end of the month is rolling around they have still failed to provide me with their bank information and yesterday I received a phone call from my realtor basically stating that after conversations among their staff and with the person who's house they are renting to me, they have decided against being paid via bank draft and will only be accepting checks or money orders in the future.

I politely but firmly insisted that I be given bank information since my lease specifically states that draft payments are allowed, and I prefer the convenience of automatic withdrawals.

My realtor refused, saying that their decision is final and if I want to drag it out in court I'll end up losing money regardless. They ended the conversation by saying that if they do not receive my money order or check by the first of the month, they will initiate legal action and I will be given a 14 day notice to pay my rent or I will be evicted.

Additionally, I will be charged 50 dollars per day that the rent is late (this is in the lease). 

Frankly, the tone of the conversation was incredibly unprofessional and I would like to know if they have some sort of leg to stand on that I haven't been able to catch (I Googled extensively!).

Despite their shitty attitude, I would like to continue living here despite their shitty behavior, because relocating will be stressful and expensive and I work an average 60 hour week with one day off. I would also like to avoid court if possible, but I understand that it may be inevitable.

Please let me know if I need to add any details. Thanks!

To date, I have done this 3 times,  at 2 cons in Texas and 1 time in my home state of California. 

I was kinda able to slip under the radar in Texas, seeing as the security and management at those events were rather lenient ( I even offered them snacks and they were happy to take some). Upon trying to pull this in California I saw that it was more of a complicated matter; But i did ask permission from the event organizers the morning of the events ( which was something i hadn't previously done) and all thought I wasn't granted permission to be inside of the event even with my admission already bought and paid for in advance. They were kind enough to let me stand near the entrance to pass out the snacks. 

Long story short, i wanted to ask if there was any legal way i could gain permission to partake in these events while doing what I do, without having to get confronted by event management or security that what I'm doing is solicitation. Or is it just a matter of getting in contact with the organizers and seeing if I can have a special permission to do it on the property.

From what I can see, I don't think I do ""solicitation"" due to:

1. I don't actively engage with the passerby, I let them engage with me if they so choose to
2. I don't block there path, I just walk non-stop until someone decides to stop me
3. I offer something, but for nothing in return, I don't ask for them to do anything for me, their is no ""catch""

I'm just planning to go through with this at a bigger event this year, and I don't want to  get into trouble. Any advice helps, Much thanks!"
236,236,[Michigan] TIL the most stubborn thing you can do in a psych-ward is to refuse treatment and complain that your family stole your money/trust fund.,"I was recently admitted to a psych-ward due to aggression problems and what they claim is bipolar tenancies. The aggression I agree with but the bipolar, I don't see it. Yeah, I have triggers. I just hate when people/family use them against me. 'Cause They know, that I know, so on and so on. And, it drives me crazy. (hehe)

I was awoken mid-November by a court-ordered psych evaluation. I was arrested and all. Then transported to a local evaluation center in handcuffs. I refused treatment. I wouldn't sign a thing or consent to anything. I just wanted to be released. I spent 8 hours just staring at the floor.

Yeah, I trashed my room. I was pissed, I was mad that I had recently sold my car. When I signed the paperwork, the title, it reminded me of when I signed away a trust; MET - Michigan Education Trust. I threw away my life that day. Just signing that legal document brought all those emotions back. What was I thinking? I gave away everything. Giving away the trust made it illegal for me to attend any higher education institutions.

I quit my job a few years ago and I only had enough savings to pay off one of my credit cards. So, I cashed the trust away. It was the dumbest decision of my life. I used a small potion of the money to payoff the credit cards and the remainder, I had a mutual agreement with my mother to use it on a later date. But, asking for money from my parents felt like I was stealing from them. I could've just asked my parents for help but I didn't want their answer of ""Get a Job.""  I threw away my life over a credit score.

I did have the odd jobs of mowing the lawn at my late grandmother's house. I was paid decently for the work. But my parent's sold the house last year and I've yet to be read the will of my late grandmother. My uncle, the executer of the will, just refuses to read it or bequest anything to me. I have nothing.



Anyways, I'm currently having a hearing at probate court in the near future. Its for review of guardianship and power of attorney since I refused to consent to anything when I was in the ward. I just want to know should I be prepared for? 

	* Will there be question to answer? 
	* Can I bring written witnesses of my character? 
	* What do I have to do show that I'm an independent adult even though I'm living with my parents and basically dependent off them for shelter and food."

238,238,"When kicking out a roommate, is it legal to change the locks and move their belongings into a storage unit? - FL","Roommate hasn't been paying her share of the bills for about 5 months now. She said she was going to pay me back with a student loan but of course that never happened. She left this weekend but not before only trying to pay just part of the bills again. I sent her a message saying that because she obviously has no plans on paying any of the past bills she owes nor future ones I am changing the locks and moving her stuff into a storage unit so I can get a new roommate. She wrote me back saying not to touch her stuff and that she will be back for it.

I want this to go as smoothly as possible since I rent an apartment and don't want any drama in my complex. I won't be charging her for the unit, I just don't want her back here. She could also be lying and just trying to get back inside so she can stop me from kicking her out.

Is it illegal to change the locks and move her stuff into a storage unit? I just don't want to do anything criminal in case she gets the cops involved. I have no problem with her suing me as she owes me so much money I doubt she would even try. And in that case, it would probably end badly for her. I don't think she can even be considered a tenant when she hasn't paid what she owes for so long?

Anyways, thanks for any tips and advice!

Edit: She is a co-tenant but she doesn't have a copy of the lease. Whenever we get in an argument and I tell her I won't pay my part either so we'll just get evicted and sued, she always says I'll be the only one getting sued because she's not on the lease. I don't know why she thinks that when her name and signature are very clearly on the lease. Just some more info because I'm brainstorming how she would prove to the cops she lives here if all her stuff is gone and she doesn't have a lease.

2nd edit: So since everyone is so protective over this person that hasn't paid her bills for **5 months** (if you don't know you're going to be evicted for not paying after 5 months you've got to be borderline mental), if she doesn't just take her belongings and leave she will completely lose access to everything else she hasn't paid for like electricity and internet. There are laws stopping a landlord from cutting off utility access to a non-paying tenant but as everyone has so kindly pointed out, I'm not her landlord. If someone is using your electricity without paying for it, isn't that theft?"
239,239,My 18 y.o. son inherited a large amount of money from his grandparents. How can I legally prevent him from spending all of it?,"Hello everybody!

&#x200B;

I know it isn't a frequent question here, but maybe you could suggest some loopholes for me. I know that you need some details. But unfortunately, I cannot share a lot here. So, I'll try to explain the whole situation here briefly.

&#x200B;

My wife's parents died years ago, leaving our son with a lot of money. Normally, he would be able to access it when he turns 18 y.o. I thought that he would use that money wisely, like pay tuition fees, deposit for his first property, or at least travel for a year or two. Unfortunately, I have to admit that my parents-in-law didn't expect that their favorite grandson would just start wasting their money.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I'm trying to change his mind and explain to him that he can easily waste that money. I even found some info on [https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/](https://www.doughroller.net/investing/how-to-invest-50k/) on what he can invest it to. But, it's not as easy as I'd expected.

&#x200B;

I'm afraid that he will lose everything just in one year. He recently got access to the bank account and spent 25K on some skins for games. I have no clue what the hell this thing even is and why it's so important for the younger generation. But who in their right mind would spend 25K on games? When I was 18, I could only dream of having a grand in my bank account.

&#x200B;

His grandparents' will state that he can get access to the inheritance when he turns 18, and there are no restrictions with regard to how he uses it. Maybe they believed that he would grow up as shy and modest as he used to be when he was a kid, which was the last time they saw him.

&#x200B;

I'm not good at the ins and outs of our legal system, hence why I am hoping to get some advice here. I ca n see how the money burns a hole in his pocket. I'm afraid that by the time he graduates, he will have all these pointless skins for the games and some expensive toys but have no place to live.

&#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for your attention. If you know what I can do in this situation, please let me know."
240,240,My friend is selling videos of her and her boyfriend having sex and wants to know if NDAs will help her legally stay safe or putting text in the video that it may not be shared. They are both 20 Y.O.,"They have only been sending videos to one guy and then deleting them afterward. 

&#x200B;

She wants to know if there is any way to protect herself from other people seeing the videos. For example, if she edited the video to say ""This video belongs to (Her name) and all Copywrite terms state that only (Name of person she is sending the video to) may view this video. If this video is shared with anyone else besides (whoever buys it) major fees/legal trouble will occur."" Will this make it so the guy cannot send the video to anyone? Also- if she makes him sign an NDA would that help? The boyfriend is consenting BTW"
241,241,Mother likely exposed to COVID is traveling and exposing babies and elderly,"As the title says, a member of my household has been exposed to someone who has Covid. This member is now show symptoms (coughing, feeling tired).  My mother was aware of this and informed me and nevertheless still travelled (flew) from NY to SC to visit my sister and her two babies as well as my 87 year old grandmother who has emphysema and my father who both live next door. Also the are the babies parents. Btw I know for a fact my. Grandmother and the babies are unvaccinated and I think the rest may not be either! I really don’t know what the right thing to do here is ! I wish my mom would take this more seriously especially considering she is a nurse!! I fear for my nephew niece grandmother and the rest of my family! The other member of my household I definitely think has covid ! I know for a fact he came in contact with someone who is covid positive! I myself am going to get tested and inform my job but the test might not detect it  so early after exposure! Idk what to do! Should I do something!? Like call the police department where my sister lives or the SC dept of health or something! No one in my family would listen to me anyway and it’s too late for that now! What if something happens to the kids or my grandmother! Would she have been allowed to fly if there was something wrong?"
242,242,"(Cananda, ON) Just moved into our apartment at the start of the month and found out our neighbours are CRAZY.","Hello everyone and Iapologize in advance if this question is frequentley asked but I couldn't find one specifically geared to me. Here goes, going to keep this as short as possible.

We (M/25, F/31, F/2yo) moved into our basment apartment August 1st. I was between jobs and I was very lucky to get this apartment for my family and I as we were down to just enough money to get it. We move in and everything seems fine until about the third day in. We get call from our Landlord about ""Perfumed Cigarettes"". I figure the upstairs tenants (three apartments in a house. Basement, main floor and attic) are talking about pot so we stop smoking on the landing outside then and there. The complaints don't stop.


 Now they are saying their house is filled with both smoke and overpowering perfumes/cologne. So we take down our automatic air freshener and seal all of the vents in order to avoid any smell at all from going up. The complaints don't stop.



Now it's our electronic cigarettes that are bothering them. Apparently so much vapour has seeped its way into their apartment that they've felt the need to get doctors notes to give to the landlord. I'm not stopping. It's not illegal and I'm feeling very intruded upon because my landlord has asked me to smoke it outside because he doesn't know enough about them.



A week ago today I recieved an N5 form for the complaints above. mainly for smoke going into their apartment though. They're claiming it's drugs. Unspecified which drugs but drugs nonetheless. We've shown our landlord everything that we've been doing to tryand avoid any problems with them but he just shrugs and say ""What do you want me to do? They complain so I have to continue with legal action. Unless you quit what your doing within 3 days.""



WE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING. This is insane. I'm afraid. My grandmother has been here with my stepson since monday and the complaints have continued all throughout the week. He seems to think I just smoke pot with my grandmother who basically acts as a judge on both my behaviour and how we're doing as a household. (I'm trying to get custody of my 9yo stepson).



He still doesn't care. My understanding is that their comlaints will eventually lead me to court where I have to defend myself against these groundless claims. Problem is that I have a criminal record and these other tenant don't and they've been here FOREVER.



I'm scared. I don't have enough money to move. I've said again and again to come to my house when the omplaint happens so I can show you nothing is happening but he says he can't. I've told him to send the cops but they dont come yet they fill out a complaint report which looks awful on me.



Do they have to prove their claims or is the constant comlpaints and records of them going to be enough? How can I protect myself? I've spoken with them a total of 2 times. Both times I could plainly see that they were mentally unstable. One of them threatened my wife over a slight misunderstanding so I just have to assume that they can't be reasoned with. They say my e-cigerette is harming them along with pot yet they smoke cigerettes like chimneys. What can I do? Is there an upside to this? Will they lose their tenancy if shown to have made baseless claims? I've heard that during court over a dispute that I am not required to pay rent during that time, That can't be true can it?



Help! Thanks in advance.   

Edit: I will try to speak with them. It's against my judgement but that seems to be the consensus. Any thoughts on what I should try to say? I'm afraid I'll just make things worse. None of you are here so you don't know the exact situation and what these people are like. I know people probably come on here all the time trying to see if there's a way to squeeze out of trouble even if they're in the wrong and try to paint themselves in a better light but the things I've stated here are verbatim. Exactly the way they happened and it's difficult to state it here without sounding exactly what I've mentioned previous. 


 Fuck man I feel like everyone's against me. I just lost my job because some big corporation decided to cancel all their contracts and hire on minimum wage employees. I went from paying a mortgage on my first home to the situation in in now and now... Fuck it. Fuck those loons. I'll see them in court or in front of a board or what the fuck ever. I try to be nice to everyone as a rule and I will be nice to them. They'll fuck up. I know they will. I'll make sure I capatalize on it when they do."
243,243,We brought our cat in to get neutered at a clinic and were returned a dead cat and a huge bill. Is there anything we can do?,"We are located in California.

We brought our 6 month cat in today to get neutered. He was a healthy cat, and he passed away during the procedure due to complications with anesthesia. 

Now, as I'm writing this we are devastated for loosing a beloved member of our family, but this is crazy. I understand it's a very freak accident and occurs very rarely, but two things I can't help but feel we were misguided about:

1.	We were never informed that this was a risk that happens to about 1/1000 cats. Yes, they give you a liability paper that no one ever reads to protect them from getting sued if you ever have to deal with a misfortune such as ours. Rare, yes, but if you have a 1/1000 chance of your pet dying, you should at least be notified verbally of the chances, don’t you think? 

2.	We don’t know if this was negligence on the staff, lack of attention to detail, misdoes or what. he didn’t have any preexisting conditions that we knew about, but he had a very audible breathing noise if you took two seconds to listen, this should have made him a pretty high contender for someone to at least be a little concerned. We weren’t notified of any of this however.) Regardless, speculation will get us nowhere, but the worst part of it all....

They still stuck us with the bill. 

We understand that a medical procedure takes time, money, and material, but we just aren’t satisfied being handed a dead cat and a ridiculous bill. Is there anything we can do?"
244,244,Opioid crisis victim,"Hello. I  am hearing all sorts of talk about ""big pharma"" being held responsible for the opioid crisis and the damage done to individuals and their families. Long story short... I was injured while in the US Navy.  I was immediately put on percocet and valium. In less than 90 days, I was being prescribed 30mg Roxicodone 3x daily. When I first ran out, I thought Inhad the flu.  When I went to my squadron doctor, he explained that I had not the flu but needed to keep taking my roxicodone. This was the moment I realized I had an addiction. I asked for time off to get over the withdrawal and was reprimanded and told to take my meds and get back to work.  I couldn't believe I had taken on an addiction without knowing. I  was super healthy ""Joe Navy"" and admittedly naive. 
Soon I was out of the Navy with an honorable discharge due to medical issues with my injury.  In less than a year the addiction I unwittingly picked up while enlisted was off the hook.  I had my general practice doctor giving me 3 different opiates, specialist giving me more. The VA was also giving me an absolutely perverted amount of drugs. Soon I was eating 5-7 100mcg fentanyl patches daily while wearing 3 on my ribs.  When I ran out early, my doctors would tweak the prescription and get me a refill early without question.  When I asked about getting help, I was told my injury required lifelong opiate therapy. It took me 2 years of digging to find a doctor willing to give me suboxone, which saved my life just before I died from opiate toxicity. I began this ride a naive fool and was taken advantage of for profit and denied helpnquitting.  I can't help but feel like others, being law firms, are going to profit off all of it.  How do I get into a class action or go about filing my own lawsuit. This isn't just about big pharma, but the doctors overprescribing. It's also about the VA giving out opiates to hush veterans who are in medical need. These meds destroyed me in every way.  I never shared. I never partied or sold. I never bought street drugs when I ran out. My addiction was a life of shame, embarrassment,  and trying not to get sick. What can I do to make a stand?"
245,245,[USA] How is RateMyProfessor not slander? Is it possible to get my reviews taken down?,"As a disclaimer, I'm not actually planning to get my reviews taken down.

I'm a professor (tenure-track, so my position is reasonably secure unless I kill someone) at a decent flagship university, and I guess this question is mostly theoretical, unless there are some easy steps I can take, in which case I will take them.

I am a good lecturer; my internal evaluations (administered by the university, usually 60-70% of my students in my 200-student class answer these) I end up scoring somewhere between 4.7-4.9/5.0. I am popular, students like me and open up to me, and I do a good job (students enrolled in other sections often come to my lectures so that my lecture hall is usually overflowing and students have to sit on the floor/stairs).

The problem with being in a job that deals with many people is that there are always someone who is disgruntled. It's generally the students who are doing poorly in classes (being a state school, there are huge variations between students; some students, having been the best in their tiny high school classes in rural areas, realize that they are below average, and they tend to struggle with coming to terms with this fact.)

For whatever reason, I tend to get the brunt of their wrath more than my colleagues (possibly because I'm young, friendly, and female, so students tend to expect me to be nicer. Along the same lines of thought, I also get a ridiculous amounts of requests from recommendation letters, even from C students, compared to my colleagues.)

This means that the few who feel particularly upset will turn to RateMyProfessor and write scathing and sometimes false reviews about me. I know that RateMyProfessor generally tries to moderate comments, but some students write things that are blatantly FALSE. One review says something along the lines of how I was a hardass during the semester, then changed my tactics around the time the internal evaluation rolled around. In reality, I wasn't even aware of the internal evaluation period, and I stayed consistent during the semester.

Another review made up quotes that I supposedly said in class that sounds very rude, but I would never say anything like this. The reviewer claims to have gotten a D in the class, but I actually gave no D's in my class (due to weird institution rule, D is a fail, and I give everyone either A-C or F). Some reviews are sexist or racist, as well.

So most of my reviews on RateMyProfessors are negative, and I am scoring somewhere in the mid-3 range (out of 5), which is almost 20-25% difference from my internal evaluations. 

Of course, no university administration takes RateMyProfessors seriously precisely because of this issue, but I know that my parents have felt very hurt from seeing these reviews, and close friends have told me that they were shocked by these ""quotes"" that they saw on RateMyProfessors.

So somehow these are somewhat damaging to my personal life, which I cannot quantify (they have no impact whatsoever to my professional life, though). I feel that these reviews are borderline slander, and while I could prove some proof that what they say is false, I would have to dig very deep and spend a lot of my time. Also, the onus shouldn't be on me; it should be on the person making these accusations.

So, is there anything I can do? I am mostly just curious about the legality of this website, because they are so targeted against individuals. I imagine they work the same way as reviewing businesses, although they are not so closely tied to the reputation of a single individual (who never really signed up for this!) and places like Yelp or Tripadvisor sometimes gives the businesses opportunities to respond (maybe I can do that too, but doing that will probably actually damage my professional reputation...)"
246,246,(CA) Can I sue my husbands doctor?,"(CA) My husband has been taking pain medication for years because he has a back injury.  He's been told that it is unadvisable to have it operated on because he will most likely roll out in a wheelchair permanently.  He's been told he will spend the rest of his life on painkillers.  His doctor has been cutting him back on his pain killers over the past two years to the point he is not functional.  He just sits in pain, bitching and moaning all day.  He's become a useless knot on a log.  He can't do anything, he is in a constant shitty mood, we havnt had sex since she cut him back... Unless something changes I'm going to have to leave.  I can't take it anymore, and it's not his fault, it these damn CA doctors!  Do I have some grounds to sue his doctors for alienation of affection and making my life hell?  My husband is too scared to try to fight it because he's scared he'll get cut off completely."
247,247,What is the Legality of Covering a Car in Saint Patrick's Day Stickers?,"I have an estranged family member that I used to live with for about four years. I eventually moved out due to constant verbal abuse. Recently, my mother gave me a few 50 counts of St Pattys Day stickers complete with leprechauns, four leaf clovers, pots of gold, etc. Now I'm not saying I have enough to cover an entire car, but maybe just one of the doors, obviously not on the glass of anything. She isn't Irish and has (to my knowledge) no strong opinion on the holiday. Would such an unruly crime be protected from being considered harrassment? Thank you for your time."
248,248,"Crazy roommate (21M) is making my (21F) life hell, can he legally kick me out if my name is on the lease? + a few other qs (NS, Canada)","Got back in touch with an old ex from high school a while ago and we started talking. I was in a really bad living situation at the time and I wanted out and he was still living with his parents so we decided to rent a place (2 bedroom/2 bath) together. I was gonna pay $500 of the rent and he'd cover the rest in exchange for getting the bigger bedroom with the ensuite. He lived far away at the time so I was the one who met the landlord and signed the lease and stuff and he just gave me the money for it, his name isn't on the lease at all. Anyway he came into some money, bought me a new laptop for school, and suddenly he offered to pay all the rent and I agreed, and he even wanted to pay 6 months rent up front (he thought we could get a discount offering this, and we did, actually). He'd interaced the deposit a few weeks earlier and I'd met with the landlord and signed the lease then so that's why my name is on it. It's a 12 month lease if that matters. In late September he gets a bank draft for almost $10k and gives it to the landlord and starts staying in the apartment. Then in October we both move in.

This is where everything starts to go so wrong. I was working and in school at the time but I was struggling with both and the new place was a long drive from work so I quit. But halfway through October I started wondering if the courses I was taking were even useful and after discussing it with my roommate we agreed that I'd be better off working and getting experience and going back to school in the future since I couldn't be a cop any time in the next 5 years anyway since I did illegal substances. So I dropped out and I wasn't working but we paid 6 months rent up front and my roommate was the one who buys groceries and stuff. Unfortunately I have bills, internet, car, insurance, phone, and didn't have any way of paying so I had to ask my roommate to help and he did. It sounds helpful but this did much more harm than good. I struggle with depression and anxiety and the only thing that has ever motivated me to work and leave the house has been when I need money urgently and with him just giving me money it became very hard to start applying for jobs so I spent most of the day just laying in bed and not feeling like doing anything.

In November I started dating one of my roommate's online friends he introduced me to through World of Warcraft. he lived in California. I really wanted to go see him but I had no way of paying for the plane ticket so I asked my roommate for help and he kept refusing, saying it was too expensive, too short notice, etc stupid excuses. My boyfriend was moving back in with his parents soon so I needed the ticket that weekend. I was so desperate and drunk I told my roommate I'd sleep with him and take his virginity if he bought the ticket but he refused. I told him I'd get a job and pay him back and he finally accepted if I paid him back AND slept with him so he bought the ticket and sent me the info. When I sobered up in the morning I realized what I agreed to and I told him I was never going to fuck him and that I was just drunk. He was upset and said I needed to pay back double the cost of the ticket (like $2000 or something) or he was going to cancel it so I agreed to once I had the money. I believe this is soliciting prostitution or extortion and I have text messages from this time, could I bring them to the police?

He didn't cancel the ticket and I went to visit my long distance boyfriend but my roommate started acting really really shitty after this. Just ignoring me, spending all his time in his room, when I brought company over he didn't even say hi. He started drinking which was alarming and around the end of November he got extremely drunk kept messaging me about how much he loved me and shit and I got scared and called the cops. I wanted them to take him to the hospital but they said he wasn't in any danger. When I told them I felt threatened they said they couldn't do anything since he technically lived here too and since we were exes I think they were taking me much less seriously or maybe it was my record, but they did nothing, they just left him here and told me I should move out. I don't have a fucking lock on my bedroom door and I went to sleep that night terrified he was going to break in and do something. In the end nothing happened but I've never felt less safe in my own home. In the morning I ran into him when I getting some water and we got into a fight and I told him how much I hated him and living here and he told me I could leave whenever. Then he went back to his room and started ignoring me again.

Around this time I wanted to visit my boyfriend again so I had to ask my roommate for money again. He just texted me asking how much and when I told him he sent the money then went back to ignoring me. I went for a week this time and he didn't message me at all. When I got back I almost expected to find him having committed suicide, but he was ok. All of December was a good month and I never had to interact with him at all except when he made supper or when we needed to go get groceries. I started applying for jobs and stuff and I was looking into how hard it was to immigrate to the USA on a fiancee visa. I was finally moving forward in life. I asked for money again so I could visit my boyfriend for Christmas and he gave it to me without complaint and I visited for 10 days, but on the last day I was there my boyfriend broke up with me and I was absolutely devastated, I had lost all of my goals and now I had nothing to work for again. I was getting drunk every night.

I decided to go on a trip to get over it and drove to Toronto with my roommate. We stayed for a few days and had a good time mostly but he got really annoyed when I asked for separate hotel rooms. I just didn't feel comfortable staying in the same room with him. He agreed eventually and the rest of the trip was fine. The drive back was very awkward and we had a couple of arguments and I finally got it across to him that I am never going to date him no matter what and the rest of the way he just ignored me. Now when we got back he was even more withdrawn than usual and started talking about how he was going to move out and stop giving me money and that these past few months were such a huge, miserable waste of time. This entire time he hasn't been working or in school and he hasn't been doing anything with his life. I wonder why it was such a huge waste of time lmao. I got pissed about this and told him that and he just went back to ignoring me again.

Now none of the jobs I've applied for have called back, I'm so broke I have no money in any of my accounts, I won't be able to pay any of my bills this month. Rent is paid for until March which is the only good thing about all this, but I need to know if he can kick me out or not? Like I said my name is on the lease, it's a 12 month contract, his name doesn't show up anywhere but verbally of course I agreed to let him stay and he paid all the money. Also if he moves out instead, is it possible for him to be on the hook for the other 6 months of the 12 month contract (since only 6 months have been paid for so far)? He verbally agreed to live here and pay the rent and it will be a breach of terms if he just bails won't it? And is it worth talking to the cops about the prostitution/extortion thing? Everything is such a mess right now and I really need help, thanks for reading"
249,249,I [24 M] got a coworker [20 F] pregnant. She is 20 weeks and I dont want any involvement including monetary but she wants to keep it? Are there any options for me?,"We live in the state nevada. Yea i fucked up here but is there any thing i could do. I dont want any involvement and shes fine with that. She said that she wouldnt force child support but wants me to sign the birth certificate and sign my rights away but id still be liable for child support. What can i do?

Edit: honestly know ill get a lot of heat from redditors but she trapped me into a kid knowing i didnt ever want any, i thought she was responsibly handling avoiding getting pregnant but she wasnt

Are there cases where child support is discontinued after a parent signs their rights away? Shes 20 weeks pregnant so we are way ahead of the child even being born

1 100% want no involvement. 100% dont want child support for me or my future wife. Im 90% sure she doesnt want me involved. And 90% sure that she will put me on the child support even though she said she wouldnt"

251,251,I have been scammed for about 20k from a webcam girl.,"I am from USA. She's from Czech.

She scammed me 11k on PayPal (PP) and ghosted me. She returned after my disputes and manipulated me to close the disputes.

The money was going to her ""Business"" account on PayPal and she was upset because I didn't do the 'friend' option.

After the 11k lost her PP was closed. She starts to pressure me to send her money through Wester Union (WU). I have lost 9k at WU now.

Everything about this ""relationship"" has been shallow and fake as possibly can be.

I know some of you are calling me a Simp. I got it.

I met her in Czech Republic at 17k before the shutdown. She promised me a lot of sex but nothing ever happened. She never did anything for me aside from taking to an ATM machine to get money. The first day we met she plays a joke on taking my debit card. The last day we met she tells me she ""forgot how my American money looks like"". Implying for me to leave some money.

We never had sex, we never even kissed, nothing between us, and I'm not bitter over that. I was honest to her but she was a world of lies to me from the start of 2019 to today.

She lied about buying so many things. I had to buy my way into her Instagram and where she told me she was, her Instagram showed her partying. I documented everything.

&#x200B;

I want to get my money back from her.

Is it possible to sue her under her business through international court?

How can I fight for my money back through WU and win?

I am willing to show all the conversations in the police report.

Prostitution is legal in Czech and even her business (webcamming).

&#x200B;

Usually when I deliver her money she gives me a week of distance.

It has caused me financial and emotional stress beyond what I can ever imagine.

I have never had a girl before and I was attractive to her. I never expected to get played like this.

I see her ""liking"" a guy's Instagram post every day. I know she's interested in him and her best friend even added the guy today.

&#x200B;

I am losing my mind and don't want my money, my future I believe I could have with this women to go to a scam and a player.

I am well aware of all the negatives comments I will be getting but this story is true and really did happen.

252,252,Stepdad broke my sons nose in a fight,"Tonight I was reviewing my sons grades and he had some crappy ones and my husband said “let’s see how your father would deal with you if you were there living w him.” 

My son got really angry and pushed him and they started physically fighting. I ran and separated them for context my son is stronger than him he is 16 almost 190 and wrestling in high school. 

After that my son went outside and called grandpa to pick him up. I went to take care of the two siblings who were crying and then I heard my husband went outside and by my sons account he started beating on him and things escalated he kicked my son in the face and broke his nose. 

My father took him to the hospital where he got an X-ray and it was really broken. The police came and told me that Florida is prosecuting both my son to juvenile because he started and my husband with a felony. 

I am so horrified and shocked and sad. I don’t even know how to begin processing. My husband is not a violent person and my son is also a really good kid but he’s a teen and sometimes has a temper. Things just escalated quickly. 

To begin...
How will the proceedings go for my son? What should I tell the judge? What are the long term consequences for him? 

How do I start to deal w my husband? Will he get bail? Should we get a lawyer? He has never been arrested before. 

I just got home and I am trying to avoid thinking that Christmas is ruined for all of us. Including two baby siblings. Even though it feels like it. "
253,253,First time DUI,"First offense and I am being offered diversion. Money is not an option. I want to get a lawyer and get out of this. 

I blew at the scene (blew .17) and did the field sobriety test. Blew again at the station (blew .14). I was extremely cooperative. Reason cops showed up is I was two houses down from my place. And went over a curb. Had to call a tow truck because car was stuck in grass. Cops showed up and investigated my drunkenness. 


Would hiring a lawyer make this any better? I’d rather pay a lawyer than the state. Diversion is expensive and I really don’t care if I have a DUI on my record. I’m going to refuse diversion and just take the charge if it comes down to it. "
254,254,My brother was the victim of the robbery. Now one if the robbers was found innocent and is suing my brother to get back the money he won from her in a lawsuit.,"For LocationBot: this is in California

The background: My brother was the victim of a beating and robbery. The people were caught and brought to justice (I thought). They all got long jail sentences and my brother won lawsuits against all of them.

Now one of the robbers has been found innocent and exonerated by the court because it was a mistake. From the lawsuit she has paid my brother some money. But now she is suing him for the $40,000 he got from her. Like I said the court exonerated her and the state gave her money for her wrongful imprisonment. I feel bad that she went to jail when she was innocent but my brother was also an innocent victim. I don't get why she is allowed to do this and is suing my brother instead of the state.

My question is: How does my brother get this dismissed, if she is even allowed to do this?"
255,255,Is this a scam ?,"So recently my sister tried to buy a gun from someone online through telegram, and the day after she got a email from the supposed agency dealing with the package saying the dea confiscated the package and the she had to pay a fine to the dea within 72 hours or she would be arrested, after having to pull out 2 loans she paid her part of the fine. Well, after paying them she got another email from the agency saying if they dont pay $8000 within 72 hours then the dea will confiscate the package and arrest both the buyer and sender of the package for illegal purchase and sells of a firearm. We just want to make sure this is real before we stop paying and my sister goes to jail, before we have to pull out anymore loans."
256,256,Judge threw out prenup and is requiring me to pay alimony [Texas],"I am very angry with my lawyer and the judge right now and I want to know how to fix this.

My ex wife and I signed a prenup when we got married. It stipulated that if we divorced, my ex would forfeit the right to alimony, child support, and 30% of the marital property (leaving her with 20% for a 50-50 split, still plenty to live on). This is because I entered the marriage with considerably more money and made a considerably higher salary (I am in a white collar position, she is a teacher). 

I thought dividing assets for the divorce would be fairly cut and dry due to the prenup, but she got a lawyer, so I got one too. Her lawyer argued that the prenup, which we BOTH signed, was unfair and illegal. The judge threw it out after my lawyer barely argued for it. He completely dropped the ball and basically just rolled over and took it. 

The judge awarded her 50% of everything except the assets I had prior to divorce, PLUS child support, PLUS alimony. It's like the prenup, a document we BOTH signed and agreed to, was completely ignored. I don't even understand what the point was since the prenup was supposed to protect me and the money I have worked hard to earn. 

I would like to know what legal recourse I have against my lawyer and the judge, since they completely disregarded the contract that my ex and I agreed on prior to marriage. I would not have gotten married had I known that such document that were intended to protect me just meant nothing. Can I sue my ex for the extra property based on what the prenup said? Can I go after my lawyer or the judge or at least report them somewhere?"
257,257,LandLord fully executes lease with $0.00 mo payment then attempts eviction,"My Landlord had me and my GF resign a lease on 7/3/18. The woman in the office showed us each page and asked us to sign . We signed and management also signed the lease. Two days later the manager sent me a copy of our signed lease stating it was the new lease going forward. At the time I didn’t pay any attention to the rent amount on the lease so I filed it away. My girlfriend did see the rent amount on the lease showed $0.00 lease payment due from 11/17/17 through 3/19/19. I am running late on my September lease payment and my land lord has filed a dispossession claim with the magistrate court seeking eviction due to unpaid rent. I pulled out my lease and realized the document states $0.00 due for the entire lease period and my GF commented that she didn’t know I had paid rent for July and August because our lease stated $0.00 due for the entire lease period. My question is: Can I enter the current binding lease signed on 7/3 into evidence at my dispossession hearing and counter sue for refund of all rent I’ve paid since 11/17/17 through August 2018 and not be charged rent from Sept 2018 through March 19. 2019 . The date the lease ends. The landlord has been very quick to. Push me out of my home of nearly 4 years when they have given other tenants in the complex well over 30 days to pay without eviction filings.

You: I want to know if I can enforce the lease stating $0.00 due from 7/17/17 through 3/19/19 to get the land lord to refund all lease payment made up to sept of this year and also stay in the lease through its expiration on 3/19/19 with $0.00 rent per month."
258,258,Sexually assaulted my girlfriend while under the influence of LSD.,"I was going to keep this brief but there is way too much to explain. I currently live in Vancouver, BC and attend the University of British Columbia. I am 19 years old with no criminal record or any history of violence in the slightest. In fact, I have always avoided confrontation and considered myself a pacifist. I was even planning on going to an anti-rape rally the following day of this incident. Anyway enough of making myself out as this good person, what I did is absolutely disgusting and unforgivable and I no longer consider myself a good person in the slightest.

On Thursday I stupidly decided to take 5 tabs of LSD, naively thinking that I could handle it and would have a fantastic time. I spent the trip lying on the couch while listening to music in my apartment with a good friend of mine trip sitting me. A few hours in I starting sweating and shaking a lot thinking I had gone insane. I began to scream and shout very scary things to my friend (who I had completely lost all recognition of) these things included suicidal thoughts but to my knowledge were not in any way violent towards anyone other than myself. I actually had no idea that I was saying these things out loud, during the trip it felt like I was travelling to parallel universes where horrible things were happening to me and my girlfriend but I had no idea until the following day that I had said anything aloud. This terrified my friend and was completely unexpected and out of character from me so he called my girlfriend who quickly came over. I continued to have these scary parallel universe situations happen in my mind and sometimes did not even recognise my girlfriend of 4 months. This was terrifying for everyone and I unfairly put a lot of stress and responsibility on them. The parallel universe situation started to improve until I became very happy and content with the current situation which happened to be real life (it seemed too good to be real life). I was now functioning normally but was very much still tripping, we went out for dinner and had a great time together. We were all happy and peaceful and I was completely unaware that anything had actually happened. My friend left and I was alone with my girlfriend. This is where it became very bad.

I have been with my girlfriend for 4 months and have always been very careful and conscious of consent and her well being. I love her very much and have never wanted to do anything that could cause the slightest harm to her. This all changed in one night. We were cuddling on the couch and I began to touch her in a non aggressive but sexual way. She asked me to stop but I continued anyway. This went on for a while, her telling me to stop but me laughing and ignoring her. It was as if I was unaware of what was happening. It began to get much much more aggressive, I was pinning her down and holding her arms back while forcing kisses upon her against her will. She was crying and I was laughing. I eventually took my penis out and began masturbating in front of her, I shouted at her to touch it and I continued shouting at her when she refused to. She then kneed me in the balls and hit me in the face as I was touching her all over and making her touch my penis. After she hit me I lost my temper and began to hit her back, I punched her in the arm and leg and she began to cry again. I continually kicked her in the leg and possibly in the back (my memory of this is quite blurred). So she ran out of the apartment and called her friends for help. But she was scared that I was still suicidal as I had earlier said I would jump out the window or stab myself in the neck in complete seriousness. She didn't want to leave me alone but she was also afraid of me. So when my/her friends arrived they called the police (for my own safety). The police then questioned her and discovered that I had assaulted her so they came to my apartment and arrested me. I spent the night in jail while still tripping on a ridiculously large amount of LSD and was very confused as to what had actually happened.

I went to court the next day and was released on bail under the conditions that I avoid direct and indirect contact with my girlfriend and my friend. I have to go back to court on Friday. I love my girlfriend more than I could ever imagine loving anyone before, the past 4 months have genuinely been the happiest months of my entire life and I care about her deeply. What I did is so horrid and completely unforgivable and I am terrified of myself and I am scared that I don't know who I am or what I am capable of. Nothing like this has ever happened it is more out of character for me than you could ever imagine and everyone that knows me knows this. It is like I became everything that I am against. My girlfriend says it was like I wasn't there, like it was someone else as if she couldn't recognise me. She says she loves me but hates what I did and somehow says she forgives me because she knows that is not who I am. She is scared that I will get a criminal record and be labelled something that I am so against and is just not me. I am also terrified of a criminal record as I feel it will ruin my entire life, neither of us want this and she wants the charges to be dropped completely. I can't afford a lawyer so I will seek legal aid (not sure how it works). The whole situation is a mess because we love each other but can't look at each other in the same way and we don't know how to get passed this.

I am terrified of myself and please understand that I am not trying to excuse myself I know what I did is disgusting and I hate myself for it and accept the consequences. But I am so scared that the past 19 years of my life are all a lie and that I am a monster. But at the same time it doesn't feel real, I only really remember it having been told what happened and so I cant remember all the details. I can see it happening in my head but it doesn't feel real it feels like I am watching it from someone else. I have been having suicidal thoughts and I don't know how to stop them. I don't know how to live with myself knowing I am a monster and the one person that I have hurt is the one person that I love the most.

I'm sorry I gave so many details that are probably unnecessary in this subreddit. My main question for you guys is whether I am able to avoid a criminal record or not.  



TL;DR  Took more LSD than could handle, sexually assaulted and regularly assaulted girlfriend, she called police for my safety (was being suicidal). She doesn't want me to get a criminal record and I want to know if this is possible."

260,260,Family/Teen Issues,"Hi all, 

First, I am posting here for potential legal suggestions, I am not looking to have a debate with anyone over gender identity philosophy or politics. I will not respond to comments debating such. Only just looking for legal suggestions. 

I have a relative, not on Reddit, posting with his permission, living in NY and working through gender identity issues with his teen (14). She's been in therapy for a while and it's gotten to the point where she's been admitted to an outpatient facility. 

The facility is adamant that she needs to be speaking to a transgender counselor/therapist and appears to be strongly pushing that line of reasoning onto her parents. Her parents want her to get help without the agenda, but it seems at every path, there it is. 

It's gotten to the point where the language they are starting to use at the facility is skirting the issue of ""medical negligence"" and potentially her being removed from them if they do not comply with allowing them to continue therapy with the people that they feel are appropriate for her. Additionally, they feel their daughter could potentially act in a way to GET HERSELF removed from them by lying or manipulating situations to that effect. 

They also have a toddler and are concerned that should something like the above happen, and she is removed from them under ""medical negligence"" conditions, there would be ramifications for their son as well. So, my questions are: 

1) Is that even a thing? If they remove her, can that translate to him as well? 

2) Is there anything that they can do proactively, from a legal standpoint, to protect themselves should the facility decide to press on removing her?"

262,262,"Involved in a hit and skip, ticket issued has messed up information.","After being forced to stay home for a few months to take care of my ill wife i got really down on money. This lead to a lapse on my car insurance. I live in Ohio in the middle of the snow belt and I was driving to a side job i was going to do for the day. The windshield was iced over after going a block down the road and i decided to turn into a parking lot to let the car warm up more. I couldn't see a truck in the oncoming lane and we collided (his fender into my front bumper). I'm young and panicked and took off because i didn't know how the situation would be handled with my lack of insurance at the time.

Fast forward a month or so later and the police showed up to my door. Asked a few questions and i confessed to a hit and skip. Now they needed to ID the car so they could write up the ticket. It wasn't at my property at the time. The officer asked if it was in my wife's name which it is. He asked if it was a Blue Kia and confirmed that. So he goes back to the station and searches the car and brings me a ticket. I look at the ticket and the vehicle they have listed on the ticket and it's a different blue Kia we own. We gifted this other car to her mom months ago and It's never had any damage and has valid insurance. I haven't driven it for a half a year and it's certainly not the car that was involved in said incident. Is there any way i can get these tickets thrown out possibly?

I know I can't legally waive any liability around my premise but I'm wondering if I can include an indemnity clause in a contract the parent's sign asking them to compensate me for any legal fees related to me taking care of their child meaning that even if I lose a court-case they have to pay my legal fees making suing me a losing proposition.

267,267,Christmas parade makes me a prisoner in my neighborhood [GA],"We live in a mid-size town in south Georgia. We moved here from another southern state but apparently it’s a “southern thing” to have the Christmas parade the Saturday before Thanksgiving because that’s what Jesus and Robert E. Lee would have wanted.

We don’t have a traditional downtown area, so our town mayor/fief lord has decided in his infinite wisdom that the four lane state highway and a major feeder road should be shut down in both directions for three hours to host the parade. As you can imagine this works out super well and no one is ever inconvenienced…except for last year when some guy was late for work and just drove through the parade at high speed. Luckily, again, we’re in the south so our comically large police department rammed him with a surplus MRAP or something and there were no injuries. 

Getting to my point, my neighborhood has two entrances and both will be blocked for three hours Saturday, 9-12. I assume emergency vehicles can break the blockade and access our neighborhood if necessary so the city thinks that’s all that matters. But is there any legal argument to make here? What if I had to be at work at 12? I’m sure the city would just tell me to leave at 8:30. 

Now if I want to be even more petty, what if I worked across the river in South Carolina? What if Amazon or USPS has to skip my house for the day because of the parade? Is that not technical interfering with interstate commerce? Can I petition Clarence Thomas to come on home and put a stop to this nonsense with some sort of injunction?"
268,268,[CA] Expelled for failing exam retake - but the professor and school contract made it seem like the retake wouldn't happen till later. Now have $100k in debt and nontransferable credits.,"tl;dr - Was enrolled in for-profit healthcare school, $100k in debt after 4 semesters. I basically feel like I was tricked into showing up to a makeup exam unprepared, then expelled in retaliation for using my disability accommodations to trade class times - the exam wasn't held in accordance with the guidelines I signed nor the syllabus, and the response to me asking whether I should prepare for a retake was essentially ""Don't bring the stuff you've needed for every exam in every other class over the last year"". Couldn't review my exam until the retake, and was told I'd be expelled if I didn't do it right then and there (ie no rescheduling). Also in my attendance contract is an arbitration clause. I'm reaching out to personal injury (breach of contract) and disability lawyers but figured I'd throw something to Reddit for suggestions.

less tl;dr:

> Start a 4th semester class with a long-standing professor we've never met before. This professor has a few arbitrary policies that don't match what we're used to from other professors - including no trading classes with other students (eg morning vs afternoon in the beginning of the semester) to accommodate schedule conflicts. 

> I ask for the class switch anyway and was denied. I plan to deal with it since medication timing would be harder but not impossible (psych drugs that I started because of the program - something like 15% of my class had started some kind of mental health treatment. Even one professor said that was the case when he was in school. Tangentally: my blood pressure went from 120/75 to stage 2 hypertension that needed beta blockers during the course of the program - and went back to normal unmedicated two months after I was expelled.). I use my disability accommodations to essentially overrule the professor's policy after another student approaches me saying they will lose their job if they can't trade with someone (me). This was the first time I invoked disability accommodations while attending.

> Professor allows me to transfer but not the other student. Fine - but this results in me being in a group of 3 for lab - difficult because groups of 2 were the norm in labs (learn a procedure, then break off into doctor-patient pairs to practice. A group of 3 means someone has to sit out and has less hands-on time to practice). 

> Student handbook says failing an exam requires remediation, a letter from the program (which I never got), meeting with professor, and scheduling a retake. Failing the retake = expulsion. Safety violations will be notified immediately after exam ends (these historically were things drilled into our head as ""you will fail if you do this"" - like not maintaining physical contact with a unsteady patient, or not disinfecting before/after patient contact). 

>I take the class final and have pretty bad technique on one part - but neither I nor my partner thought it was bad enough to fail. 

>Days later I got an email saying my performance considered a safety violation and that we should meet - I ask if I should prepare to retake the exam and the reply email was, in its entirety: ""Don't worry, don't bring [individualized tools required for every exam]"". Because other final exams were happening, exams weren't announced to be available for review, and other students who failed met before to discuss why they failed + schedule a retake at that meeting, I put it out of my mind since I don't want to antagonize the professor asking for a more direct answer.

> Day of the meeting: I show up and was told tools would be provided and this was my retake. I was told what I failed at and why (conceptually I knew since I had done it before and was told by the professor I did it right when we first learned) Cue panic - did I miss something in the e-mails? Is this really going to be my retake that determines if I fail out of my doctorate? I hadn't taken medication, wasn't allowed to reschedule even a day later, and make a shoddy attempt at the retake before being told I could leave. I e-mail the professor saying I know it was a bad attempt and that I'd like to meet to verify I can do it before I perform it on actual patients - doing just well enough to pass vs being able to do it well on actual people matters to me. 

>A few weeks later during semester break I'm told I failed. Which sucks on several fronts, but also because now I don't have student loan money coming to cover rent.

>Appeal to the program director, denied. Told to appeal for reinstatement in 5 months, and to wait for suggestions on how to improve.

>4 months go by: Program faculty have yet to reply to several emails asking for updates, so I request and get an appeal extension. 

>10 months go by: I get an e-mail with drafted suggestions on how to build a reinstatement appeal (but not final ones).  Generic things like ""demonstrate ability to follow directions"". A bit late to do much since the appeal's due in 2 months, but I write my appeal around those suggestions with the job I had for the past year along with other stuff (9 pages of reflection and 20 pages worth of doctor's notes, therapist letter of rec, personal letters of rec, etc).

>2 months go by: I submit the appeal, denied via form letter.

Due to the nature of the program - the credits earned don't transfer to other similar programs, can't practice without a licence, so my time spent at the program is essentially a $100,000 hobby/talking point.

Other than having to postpone a first-semester exam and doing just barely passing on it first try and retaking an online quiz due to a low grade, I haven't had other difficulties academically. My overall score in the class I failed was an A-, but because ""safety violation"", the A- became a 0. 

Things seem weird with the program on the whole - like most of the class failing one final exam because a professor left mid-semester. Since I started, two program heads and a half dozen professors (there's about a dozen professors total) have left for ""family reasons"" - including the professor who failed me.

269,269,White males a protected class?,"Location: Colorado

GM of my company just blatantly exclaimed in front of me (white, male) to another coworker that ""white males are NOT a protected class.""

I don't get offended by much, but to have this happen in the workplace, in front of me with her smug tone, as if I'm supposed to just shrug and continue about my day, really pissed me off.

Was this just rude, or is this actually some kind of beach of law? Given the statement itself is both blatant racism and sexism, I can't imagine how this is OK to claim as being acceptable in the workplace. Whether or not this is legal, I'm not sure.

It was in reference to a white male that they'd previously fired and who is now suing."
270,270,Dead body Near Apartment,"Location: Jersey City, NJ

A few hours ago my dad encountered a dead body and we don't know how to approach this gently. I will be honest, my dad and I don't exactly trust the police so we want to do everything possible to be within the law. 

I have cameras situated in the building and around the outside so what I thought of doing is getting an external hard drive and putting all the footage from after Wednesday into it and when the police arrive we have a way where they can find the criminal.

So is this the right approach and can you type out what I am supposed to do in steps so that way this can go as cleanly as possible. As you can see, I am panicking and so is my father so it would be very appreciated.

Also, if it helps my mom and dad are the legal owners of the apartment complex."

They claimed I was going 33 in a school zone that started about 50 yards from where they stopped me. There were four cops total and one had a laser which was used on me.

Can I fight this ticket myself and save the cost of a lawyer? Or should I get a lawyer and show him my evidence? 

Biggest reason I may be able to beat it myself: upon looking at the schools website and looking at their school zone times, it claims it starts at 2:30PM and ends at 4PM. 

On my ticket, the time it was issued says 2:29PM not counting the fact that the officer had to look up my credentials because I didn’t have my ID or insurance. (Very stupid, I know, but I live like a 4 min drive to work and was in a hurry)

273,273,Gym Class Banned My Wife and I,"My wife and I did a 2 week trial at a well known workout class franchise that we really enjoyed.

The trainer filmed my wife without asking her consent. When she asked him not to film her he responded by telling her that if she wanted to be in the class that this was a part of the drill. She asked if she had signed some sort of consent form and he told her “I'll fucking delete it so you wouldn’t make a big deal about it.”

Naturally, she felt disrespected. I talked to him after class asking him to apologize to her for his attitude. He reacted by telling me that I was giving him attitude. My response was ""I'm asking you to apologize for filming my wife without consent, then being an asshole about it"". He didn't like my calling him an asshole and terminated both of our memberships.

The terms of agreement specifically state that consent must be obtained for photos and videos. In addition, nowhere in the terms of agreement does it state that the instructor has the right to terminate our memberships in this way.

We've contacted HQ and they were not helpful stating that ""the studio is not comfortable having you in the class"". Is there any recourse here to rejoin the class? Sure the guy is an asshole, but the workout is good and the location is incredibly convenient."

Still in New York.

I was taken to camp earlier this month and i did not resist going but i was very very upfront with my parents that i wasnt going to participate whenever possible, they did not take me seriously. I went on the plane and told the conseulers the same once I got on the bus. I was very polite but honest about it. my tactic was to use peaceful ""nonviolent resistance"" until they let me go home unless it turned out to be a crazy camp which it wasnt. I read a book about the civil rights movement a few monts ago and i based what i did off that. Obviously me being at a camp isn't even close to human rights things but the technices still work.

I got to my cabin and I just stayed on bed and politely told them that I didnt plan on doing the exercises. the counselors spoke to me nicely than less nicely and tried to convince me to move but they couldn't and I'm too big to drag off a bed even if they wanted to. They were nice people and i wanted to be nice to them as well but i again was open and honest through everything. i just did not go to stuff after i went into my cabin. i politely calmly refused to go to the opening ceremony, exercises, meetings, activities even though nothing was optional. when the kids in my cabin spoke or tried to convince me to come down I also politely refused to speak to them. They then said that I wouldn't get dinner/lunch if I didnt come down and participate and I refused asuming that they need to feed me sometimes.  

I was right. they didn't give me dinner that night or breakfast because i didn't go to eat but someone brought me a lunch the next day even if it was a terrible overly healthy type of thing. i was still very hungry and very bord but i just kept imagining getting out early. that lasted for six days with me spending all of my time on the bed with them bringing me food. I brought books but they took them away so I just sat and entertained myself by imagining stuff. it was the most boring thing i've ever done. After a week or six days (not sure) the headmaster owner/leader of the camp came and spoke to me directly. Again he was very nice to me and I tried to be nice back but I was open about that i wasnt doing anything until I went home. he was trying to convince me that I wanted to lose weight, but I didnt.

The next day he called my parents and I left for the first time to speak to them in his office. They begged me to do it and we had a weird conference call meeting with them on the phone and the headmaster were they were all trying to convince me to participate and even shaming me a bit, but again I calmly refused very simply. They said they were going to wait three more days to give me ""time to think about it"", and I told them it wouldn't make a difference but they did it anyway so i sat another three and then an extra day waiting. After that we had one more conference and then I was sent that night on a plane ticket home because i peacefully refused to do everything and they saw no point keeping me there. They really tried shaming me near the end but I just told them that i couldn't feel ashamed for not doing something that they wanted me to. I felt slightly sad about having to be a pain for the conseulers or the head guy because neither did anything wrong to me but I was very very very happy that I won't have to spend me whole summer their. My parents are in a sad mood since I came back and they arent really speaking to me but at least i'm home and I won't have to spend another month there. They also got some of the money back because i wasn't there the whole time.

I appreciate all the advice i got even if i don't agree with all of it. thank you. I got most of my summer back."

I have a gf that i love, and a job that i like, why would i send that shit on purpose? And why would i send a reflection?
I lost my job.

Couple days ago i heard that this picture is something that she has saved on her phone and that she goes around saying that ive sent her multiple pictures with my penis visible/half visible, and all my co-workers have seen this alleged picture and heard these things from her. People who were once friends have stopped talking to me and i feel like my life is so ruined that i dont wanna live in the same city and maybe even in the same country anymore. Because im so ashamed, people have told me ”relax as long as you know its not on purpose then its not a problem” but it is for me.

I didn't have it done. My sister did.

A few days afterwards, she had two seizures both around 6am. The first was because her sugar dropped and she was dehydrated. The second time, we’re unsure. She's never had seizures before. She's never had a problem with low blood sugar. She has been in and out of the hospital and they've been running tests. She doesn't have a history diabetes or epilepsy.

She is super depressed. She doesn't move from the couch. She can't drive for 6 months because of the seizures. She's constantly running to the bathroom and her sugar keeps rising and falling. It's like living with a ghost.

Her doctor doesn't care. He thinks everything is fine. He didn't showcase concern about her being hospitalized 5 times. He didn't tell her all of the possible side effects... even rare ones like hypoglycemia .

My mum is thinking about getting a lawyer due to the doctor's negligence. Is it even worth it? Would it help? Is this something we should try?

287,287,[PE] My wife wants me to get rid of my dog. What are my legal options?,"Throwaway.

I'm going to keep this short. I have a pitt rescue, I had him even before I met my wife. I adopted him when he was 15 months old. He had an owner that neglected him and he was very aggresive and ill when I got him, but we managed together and now he's fine. He's a bit wild and sometimes freaks out, but he never gets out of my control. He's the sweetest boy ever. My wife doesn't like him very much, but he's never been aggressive to her except a few incidents in the beginning. She's always been hinting that if we ever have children, we have to get rid of him, but I didn't think she was being serious.

Well, two weeks ago, she broke the news to me that she was pregnant. First i was thrilled even though it caught me by surprise, but then she dropped the bomb on me. She told me that she's not going to raise a kid in a household with my dog and that i have to get rid of him. I definitelly won't do that. I love my dog and I don't think he would do anything to our kid.

What are my legal options here? Can she somehow force me to get rid of him? Can she have him taken by animal control without my consent? i don't want to lose my wife in the process, but I also don't want to lose my dog. If we put him away, it's death sentence for him. No one will adopt a pitt rescue at this age.

289,289,Downstairs neighbor might be a white supremacist,"My husband and I live in an apartment complex, and our building has eight units. It's recently come to our attention that our neighbor in the unit directly below ours is probably a white supremacist. I went downstairs the morning after the debate and there was a homemade sign on his patio window saying ""stand by"". At some point in the past 36 hours, he's also added a print out of the Confederate battle flag.

Now, what I suspect might make this a ""you just have to wait and see"" scenario is that we haven't had any real contact with him since we moved in a few months ago, but we haven't had any real issues either. But these two papers are extremely worrisome because my husband is black, and I am white. I've contacted the property manager and the landlord. Both say there's nothing breaking the lease agreement since they aren't actual flags and they're inside the apartment (rules prohibit flags attached to the outside of the building). We would like to avoid moving because the apartment is otherwise perfect and we don't have thousands of dollars laying around to pay to break the lease and then pay deposit and rent at another place.

We're in California.

290,290,What happens if my GF decides to get pregnant without my consent?,"Xpost from r/relationships as this seems like a more appropriate sub. 

Hi reddit. I have a question that is, for now, thankfully, hypothetical. I’m not a lawyer nor do I have knowledge of what the law specifies but I’m looking for relationship advice, as well.

So here’s the thing. Recently, my best friend was told by his gf that she’s pregnant. He definitely didn’t want a kid and he trusted her when she said she’s on birth control. Now this made me wonder and realize that it can happen to me or to anyone else. What then?

I am currently in a serious relationship with this girl and have been for 8 months. She’s wonderful, we live together, I can see a future with her but I absolutely hate the idea of having kids or even an unwanted pregnancy that would end in abortion. My GF is taking birth control pills. Just to be clear, we started out using condoms and continued using them until we both got tested and she was already on bc for 3 months. Now after I heard about my friend, I’m super paranoid. What if one day she decides to just not take the pills and get pregnant? Would I be responsible for a child I totally don’t want and certainly did not consent to? I’m seriously considering starting to use condoms again but my GF would surely ask questions. I was also considering a vasectomy since I never ever want kids (vasectomies are perfectly doable in my state at this age, I checked). We also discussed the whole “having kids” topic, I made myself very clear and she said, “well, I think I want kids at some point”. That freaked my out for a bit but I forgot about it until what happened to my best friend.

Reddit, what would happen in the scenario I described? Can I be forced to pay for a kid I didn’t consent to conceive? Long term, vasectomy is the way to go for me regardless but until that happens, I would like to know what are the possibilities.

EDIT: I live in the US. Thanks everyone for the unanimous response. Wow, I must say, I’m no lawyer but this still sounds wrong to me even if it’s the law. If someone maliciously baby traps the other person, their life is essentially ruined for the next 18 years. Insane.

TL;DR: I’m paranoid about my GF trying to get pregnant without telling me"

292,292,"I Was Sexually Assaulted By A Medical Professional Ten Years Ago As A Minor, Is It Too Late To Do Anything About It?","Ten years ago I was 12 years old. I am now a 22 year old trans man but at this time I identified and presented as obviously female. This happened in Texas, USA, 2013. I had undergone three very intense surgeries, two of which because I nearly lost my life, and the last of which left me with a physical disability for months.

This was the first major trauma I had endured and became incredibly depressed after being released as I could no longer make or keep friends and felt incredibly embarrassed about my obvious medical problem (an illeostomy bag and wound vac were implemented.)

My mom talked to my GI and he set me up an appointment with a female child psychologist. 

My grandparents who were my legal guardians along with my mom left immediately as directed by her, and the doctor began to ask me squarely questions about sex. This included describing and asking me if I'd heard about sexual acts like oral and anal. Despite assuring her I was not sexually active and showing real disgust she continued for a long time. She then had me dress down to a gown and lay on the bench with my legs up. She proceeded to pull down my gown and feel my breasts and also stick her finger inside and around my vagina. She did not inform my guardians about what she was doing before or after. Then my appointment was over, and I left feeling violated and more depressed.

I suppressed this memory for years until recently when I had to get an invasive procedure that went much differently in terms of explanation as to what was happening, having a female nurse present, and the obvious care for my comfort.

I am unfamiliar if the statute of limitations has passed or if I even have enough to make it worth it. If I do, I want to. She is old enough to still be working with children.

Thank you in advance.

EDIT: Typo

UPDATE: Mom confirmed she was a child psychologist, and never asked or requested to get my hymen checked, and she never suspected me to be sexually abused. So it is not looking great. Tomorrow we will begin to dig up my pedi records and get in touch with the pedi doctor who recommended her, since my mom said my pedi doctor highly recommended her and had used her for other patients dealing with depression and anxiety.

EDIT FOR EXTRA INFO: Ten years ago the region I lived in was mostly rural and the hospital served a mostly rural group. When I first started going the adult and pediatrics were mixed, but at this time they were changing the hospital to become an adult hospital and building/renovating for a Children's hospital. At the time of this event more people began to move to the area and the hospital began to spread out, as they received more specialists and more people wanted to work there and live there. The pediatric stuff was on one floor for about a year and a half. I went there for my anemia, my GI, and any infusion I needed (usually blood, iron, and at one point Crohns medicine). All the doctors offices looked the same and also acted as recovery rooms, IV rooms, and infusion rooms, and were not exclusive to one doctor, due to the upsizing of what was going to become a purely ""adult"" hospital and the creation of a purely ""children's"" hospital. The room I saw this lady in looked like a normal doctors office and for the talk portion I sat in a chair and she sat at a desk, and moved me to one of the medical beds that you'd see in any clinic room, and I was used to being on cause it's how my GI doctor would examine me. 

This hospital chain is now much larger than it was when I was a kid and has smaller clinics deeper into rural areas. I spent the last three years in pediatrics at the new children's hospital and had my physicals, general visits, blood tests, and therapist visits at the clinics closer to where I actually lived."

Although I know this is a common thing in the USA I still feel like less of a man and hate that it happened.

As far as I know my parents, technically being legal guardians at the time, consented, which means that there's nothing I can do. However I do not know the specifics, I'm not sure if written consent was given or only verbal, and I am certain she was given pain medicine which could invalidate consent, correct?

I believe what happened to me as an infant has given a gigantic hit to my self esteem and is resulting in some pretty heavy depression and anxiety, however I'm not sure how to prove this in a court, I mean how would I connect it? I could get a brain scan maybe, but if something was there how could it be connected to the circumcision? I mean it is to the point where I have trouble taking care of myself and responsibilities, such as getting out of bed or feeding myself, or hygiene or errands, and all of that is not necessarily resulting from what happened to me as an infant, as I have other troubles in life, but I believe it's a huge part of it.

I know of the hospital I was born in and the woman that delivered me, although I don't know for sure that she was the one who performed the circumcision.

I told him theres no way as I have kids to watch and stuff and he cant just change my schedule without warning!!

So he tells me on the phone that if I dont come in I'm fired??? I refused to come in and now apparently I'm fired because he changed my schedule with no notice???

297,297,School calling police for social media drama. (US-WA),"So someone in our school had the ""bright"" idea of making an anonymous Instagram account to mess around with people he/she don't like. That got the attention of the school who claimed they called the police to investigate. Our school has known to not respect freedom of speech on or even off-campus, which they dont have to because it's a private school. But I felt this should be protected by the first amendment. The school is claiming it to be online bullying, but as far as every student is concerned no one is negatively impacted and this is just typical teen drama. The only limitation I can find is defamation, but is that enough to warrant a police investigation?

298,298,"(NE) Parents Forcing Me To Take Meds, What Can I Do?","Hi everyone. I am 19 years old, which is the legal age of adulthood in my state. However, upon turning 19, my parents were able to gain guardianship of me. This has proven to be a real loss for me, because now they have kicked me out of the house, taken my money, and put me in a group home where they and a psychiatrist are forcing me to take meds.

Now I assume that the best course of action here is for me to get guardianship back, and I am looking into this. I don't have the money for a lawyer but I plan to visit the courthouse one of these days and talk to one of the free lawyers at the help desk about filing for guardianship.

However, I have a real problem with meds. I am strongly, and I mean strongly, opposed to them. In my eyes, they violate my moral beliefs. I believe that my body is a sacred and holy thing and that taking pharmaceuticals such as these is a dangerous and harmful thing to my health. My question is, how can I use this to my advantage and take control of what goes into or out of my body? Can I take them to court about it? Can I talk to a judge and have the judge declare that I legally cannot be forced to take meds? What can I do?

Please only post helpful things, I don't want to hear about how I should just suck it up and take the meds. These meds have been very uncomfortable and harmful to me already, and I want to have the legal ability to never be forced to take meds that I don't wish to take again. I feel like there should be some sort of legal structure that protects me here. Thanks."

The russians saw this but did not care seeing as how i would work a minimum of 6 hours a day with an upwards of 16 hours a day -- i worked every single day never had one day off ... my brother in law, slowly and passively building up resentment for my drug use & distribution (even though i bought his food and such) is the one that is receiving the payment currently (now that all 146 plants are harvested) and has brought me 4 pounds of good cut flower and 3 pounds for my girlfriend. because i was marked as a patient (with 6 plants) and i was also marked as a grower (my gf was not) --- for the hundreds of hours i slaved (literally 75 hours a week sometimes)  accepting maybe 100$ a week, i was givin 1000$ AND WAS TOLD that more money would be givin to me sometime that next week (about 6000$ left unpaid) 
IS THERE ANYWAY i could take them to court, for not giving me enough weed or money for the hours i worked? i dont wanna call in any favors to escalate things with them but i have made it clear (person to person innuendos) thats where this will lead them 

is there some marijuana enforcement agency that makes sure the grower and patient laws are aided by?  i am in oregon, and it was december that my grower and patient licence expired but i dont think that matters... any advice in anyway would be much appreciated thank you "
301,301,"Landlord damaged our property while evicting, can we sue in small claims court to get it count against our back rent we owe? (Wisco)","My girlfriend and I rented an apartment from an older woman (not like a corporate owned building). She used to work with us on back rent but eventually we were three months behind and she said we would have to move out Dec 1. We agreed but couldn't find a place and she agreed to extend it Dec 15. 

We found a place but we have jobs and couldn't move out so she said we had until Dec 19 to move out and that the extra days would all be added to our unpaid rent pro-rated (so three months and 19 days, about $2180).

We moved out all the furniture and stuff but still had a few things, some work clothes and some food/drink in the refrigerator and glasses/silverware in the cupboards. I should say we spent the night of Dec 19 at our new place and though for was OK we left a few things in the old place. In Wisconsin it was below zero temps and a blizzard which made moving harder. We mostly cared about the work clothes because my girlfriend needs to meet a dress code for her job. Well we weren't totally out by Dec 19. We came back and her adult son was there changing the locks. He said we were out of time and he was throwing away whatever was left. We threatened to call the cops and he said go ahead and left.

The cop came and listened to our story and said legally our tenancy was terminated Dec 19 since her and us agreed to that and even we moved out bc we weren't there. I should say we didn't have a lease and were just month to month. Ok. He said we could arrange a time with her to get our stuff back or handle it civilly in small claims court.

So we called her a bunch of times and finally got her. She said we could come back Dec 20 and get our stuff. My gf went over there and nobody was there, door still locked, but our shit was just outside the front door of the building in boxes. Our food and stuff froze and burst in the cold weather and some glasses and plates broken. We think this is pretty outrageous she let some of our food and stuff get ruined when she knows we're hard up for money. Also my girlfriend had to call in sick for work because she didn't have the right clothes to go to work on Dec 20.

We estimate $130 in damages ($80 in missed work and $50 in damaged possession) and would like it to count against the $2180 we owe her. We called and told her this and got all pissy, basically turned into a screaming match on the phone, and she said she cut us all these breaks and now we're fucking her around and we're pieces of shit and to pay we we owe her or she'll sue us and report us to credit reporting agencies. She also said there was damage beyond the $600 deposit and that she could add additional charges to our bill if she wanted.

Can we take her to small claims court to get the cost of the damages taken off our rent bill?"
302,302,Being harassed at work after nosy coworkers violated my privacy and took pics of me with my boyfriend. Mngmt will do nothing even as I'm being blatantly bothered.

I met my current boyfriend, who is in the process of seperating from his wife, at work. Before that I was in another relationship also in the workplace which caused some gossip but nothing insanely disturbing. The other day I found out that someone I work with had taken pictures without my consent of me kissing my boyfriend at a football game. The pictures have gone viral at work and now I'm being harassed by alot of different people. People are whispering about me behind my back and calling me a slut, people are threatening to call his wife and tell her about it, and are just doing things like treating me poorly and not talking to me, giving snide answers to innocent questions, or slamming doors on me.

Today I was confronted by a relative of his wife's in the bathroom. She cussed me out, called me a homewrecker, said that if we weren't at work she'd beat me up, and said to and I quote, watch my back. I pulled out my phone to record her but by the time I got it to record, I just got a clip of her saying that I should be embarrassed by behavior.  

All these things have been documented by me and given to supervisors but they just shrug it off and treat me really indifferently. HR has taken the stuff but literally done nothing with it. Now I just found out that a GoFund me is going around to support my boyfriend's wife, that says due to an 'individual' in the office, they will be divorcing and she'll need money. My coworkers are apparently circulating it via work email.

I feel like I'm constantly being slutshamed at work. I get it, I know why people are being judgey but it's none of their business and no one has any right to be so nasty to me. Do I have a case if I take this to an employment lawyer especially since pics were taken without my consent? Is that a violation of my privacy?

306,306,[AZ] ‘Grounds’ to raise in a Federal habeas corpus petition?,"Hello legal scholars,

My girlfriend has been misdiagnosed by the mental health industry, who is using an order of the court to force her to submit to harmful treatment. I've hit a dead end in the state courts, and intend to file another habeas corpus petition in the US District court. I would greatly appreciate your insights into how to best word the ""grounds"" to raise. 

# Backstory

When the first hospital wouldn't let my girlfriend leave once she'd recovered from her alcohol withdrawal episode, I ran across the term [habeas corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States) in the Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) section on [Judicial Review](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00546.htm).  Not being familiar with the term, I consulted with wikipedia. “Oh, how useful.” (At the time A.R.S. 36-546 did not yet apply to my girlfriend, as she had not yet been ordered by the court to submit to the mental health system.)

The next day I wrote a note that politely asked the hospital to release my girlfriend. She signed it, we delivered this to a hospital employee, and I was promptly passive-aggressively banned from the premises. So I wrote a petition for writ of habeas corpus and took it to the superior court. The commissioner evaluated my filing, decided there was [prima fascie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie) evidence that my girlfriend was being illegally detained, and ordered a hearing for the next day. 

At the hearing the commissioner informed that the hospital had emailed to say they weren’t going to come. She further said that she’d investigated the hospital's filings with the county's mental health court, found that the hospital’s 48 hour involuntary hold had expired, and ruled that my girlfriend was to be released, unless the hospital filed a proper “petition for court-ordered evaluation”. 

I made two mistakes in this first habeas corpus case:

* I assumed the hospital’s legal department would be on the hospital's property (pre-hearing). My process server knew where the legal department was, but I couldn't afford another $300...
* I should have called the police to accompany me back onto the hospital’s property, and extract my girlfriend from their court-certified illegal custody (post-hearing).

I was attacked by an ex-cop security guard, who knew just what to say to get me arrested. I went to jail, and my girlfriend got sucked into the make-work mental health system. The petition for court-ordered evaluation was filed 3 days after my habeas corpus hearing. 

# Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here

The mental health industry is every bit as stupid as I suspected - they violate every principle and maxim that has helped modern doctors to stop [killing their patients](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/theodoric-of-york/n8661). My girlfriend briefly escaped after six months of palliative treatments that only worsened her tendency to self-medicate. I got her into another county, where they allowed the harmful tranquilizers (""[anti-psychotics](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2013/antipsychotics-taking-the-long-view.shtml)"") to temporarily lapse. 

She got a job, and was doing well. But the damage caused by harmful prescriptions doesn’t magically go away as soon as you stop taking them. She had a “stressful” second day of work, resumed drinking… arrested → inescapable stress → “drug therapy” (rip-off) → malnourishment → inescapable stress → street drug relapse → resumption of forced administration of tranquilizers → “Dual diagnosis drug treatment” (more inescapable stress)…

# Judicial Trickery

I petitioned the new county’s court for another writ of habeas corpus. Instead of doing her job, the judge “tweaked” the statutes so she wouldn’t have to cause problems for the community’s mental health provider. My petition was dismissed “[without prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_term)) to the proper procedural filings.” 

I did what the order of dismissal said “must” be done. It didn’t work, so I revised & re-filed. Twice. After the third dismissal I realized that the judge had abdicated her duty to justice. 

The three orders of dismissal quote A.R.S. 36-546(A)(1) (second link above) as:
> “A request in writing **must** be “presented to *any member of the treatment staff of the agency* providing the patient’s treatment. The request may be made on a prescribed form that shall be prepared by *the facility* and made available for use by any person.”

Italics and mismatched quotation marks as used in the orders of dismissal. Bold is my emphasis. 

The actual Section 36-546(A) reads (link above) as:

> A. **In addition to the procedure for applying for a writ of habeas corpus, as provided in [title 13](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=13), chapter 38, article 26,** a patient receiving court-ordered treatment or any person acting on the patient's behalf may request the patient's release pursuant to the following: 
> 1. A request in writing *may* be presented to any member of the treatment staff of the agency providing the patient's treatment. The request may be made on a prescribed form that shall be prepared by the facility and made available for use by any person. The completed form shall identify: [...]
> 
> (bold/italic emphasis added)

([13-4121](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/04121.htm) and [13-4122](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/04122.htm) are the two most-relevant parts of title 13.)

See what the judge did there? The statute used to justify the dismissal of my habeas corpus petition clearly indicates that my petition is allowed as provided elsewhere. This statute just provides an additional procedural remedy that may be used to initiate judicial review on behalf of someone else. The orders of dismissal changed 'may' to ‘must’. I didn’t fully appreciate the trickery until after I’d already filed my notice of appeal, after the 3rd identical dismissal.

The Court of Appeals panel dismissed my appeal for lack of jurisdiction, but didn’t comment on how it was okay for the judge to completely change the wording of the law to justify her dismissal. Their dismissal also said they’d looked to see if I’d complied with the judge’s misreading of the law, but conveniently overlooked the certified mail post card & receipt that proved I’d done what the judge said “must” be done to initiate judicial review on behalf of someone else.

I next petitioned the Supreme Court for review. Quorum is 3; the chief justice & vice-chief justice were on the panel of 4 that decided to deny my petition for review. Hrmph.

# Federal Court 

Since the Arizona state courts have refused to do their job, I can petition the US District Court. Habeas corpus is usually used by prisoners. My girlfriend is now being forced to stay at the drug treatment facility, so she’s just as much a prisoner as any other inmate. 

The [provided form](http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/forms/prisoner-form-petition-writ-habeas-corpus-person-state-custody-pursuant-28-usc-%C2%A7-2254) says: 

> “For this petition, **state every ground on which you claim that you are being held in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.** Attach additional pages if you have more than four grounds. State the facts supporting each ground.” (emphasis added)

This is where I’d appreciate /r/legaladvice's insights. These are some of the grounds that I am considering raising in my next petition:

* Ground #1: Denial of [procedural due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_due_process) –  I think the judge’s “rewording of the law” falls under this category…  

    * My girlfriend’s treatment is in nearly-complete non-compliance with the requirements of [A.R.S. Title 36](https://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=36), Chapter 5. The reference to habeas corpus ([A.R.S. 36-546](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00546.htm)) is the only safeguard, but this is meaningless if the judges decide that it’s too inconvenient to tell the mental health profiteers that they can’t actually do whatever they want to people. Does my girlfriend's treatment's non-compliance with the requirements of state law fall under denial of procedural due process?

    * refusal to provide ""Some Kind of Hearing""
    * New evidence: my videos that prove friend is 100% innocent of the charge of having a 'mental disorder'. She was fine 2 weeks before her first hospitalization. I didn't realize I had videos until a year after the court found my friend to have a ""persistent or acute disability""...
    * I/she/we have been denied “the opportunity to be heard.”)
    * Judge protecting the community's mental health provider is not a 'neutral-decision maker'
    * ex-parte applications for court-ordered evaluation by hospitals also denied opportunity to be heard. 

* Ground #2: Denial of [substantive due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process) –  I think forcing people to take palliative drugs would qualify as denial of this right. People get psychotic for various reasons. A mental health system that respects people’s rights might wait for people to recover (like they used to, before the FDA approved “maintenance medicines”…), instead of forcibly ""stabilizing"" them with harmful prescription drugs. 

    A line on that wikipedia page says substantive due process protects the rights of ""discrete and insular minorities"".
    
    “To justify deprivation of fundamental rights, substantive due process requires the action: 
    - Furthers a compelling state interest
    - Is the least-restrictive/intrusive alternative” - [The Illegality of Psychiatric Imprisonment - slides used in the youtube video](http://psychrights.org/education/PsychOut2011/PsychOut2011IllegalPsychiatry.pdf)
    
    There is no “legitimate government purpose” in using court orders to make people profitable to the mental health industry. Yes, some people are violent crazies, but by treating people with palliative drugs that make people worse (Thomas Insel's NIMH blog post, linked above, etc), the government's legitimate purpose should be in forcing the mental health industry to adopt less-profitable effective practices.

    Is forcing a person to take FDA-approved drugs that worsen their actual problems a substantive due-process violation?

    Is the vague finding of “persistent or acute disability” ([A.R.S. 36-501](https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/36/00501.htm), #36) a procedural due process violation, or a substantive due process violation?

* Ground #3 – Denial of 'equal protection'.  Habeas corpus is the only way to review the treatment received by persons subject to orders for court-ordered treatment. The Arizona constitution forbids suspension of habeas corpus, but my judge’s re-wording of the law says persons accused of having a ""mental disorder"" and/or subjected to orders for court-ordered treatment have no access to the courts except through the assistance of the abusive mental health agency’s medical director and an apathetic public defender. 

    “The U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Waley v. Johnson (1942) interpreted this authority broadly to allow the writ to be used to challenge convictions or sentences in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights where no other remedy was available. [...]” [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Federal_law)

* Ground #4 – Ineffective assistance of counsel. 

    - 1st public defender didn’t know “methadone-induced alcoholism” was an entirely-reasonable defense against the charge of being “persistently disabled”. (A.R.S. 36-501 #25 distinguishes “mental disorders” from conditions caused by drug & alcohol abuse.  Public defending mental patients is surely not the most glamorous job in the public defense profession, but the statutes aren’t that complex… Shouldn’t a public defender take a little time to become familiar with them?
    - 2nd public defender (when order for treatment was issued) should have demanded my testimony. They didn't have an address for me, so my summons was never sent. Furthermore, my girlfriend's parents really wanted the order for treatment issued, because they thought the mental health professionals would try to help their daughter (lol). The second public defender also should have called expert witnesses to refute the state's advocation that maintenance with palliative drugs was the only effective treatment option. 
    - Girlfriend’s current public defender is actively refusing to provide services. 

* Ground #5 – Infliction of “cruel and unusual punishment”. Forcing people to take prescriptions that makes them suicidal is cruel. Forcing a recovering cocaine user to take prescription drugs that make them [want to use more cocaine](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-011-2231-6) is also cruel, especially when we now know [how to eliminate cocaine cravings](http://www.statepress.com/article/2017/09/spscience-asu-professors-fight-addiction-with-drugs).

* Ground #7 – reservation of rights. Should I mention this? Does the right to refuse medical care falls under this ground as well?  

* Ground #8 – less intrusive approaches to helping improving someone’s health than forcing them to take suicide-ideation pills. Simply implementing “present medical knowledge” instead of maintenance tranquilizers would be enough. 

* Ground #9 – chain of custody considerations? I maintain that my girlfriend was human-trafficked into the mental health system. 

* Ground #10 - Should I mention something about evidentiary standards?

307,307,[MI] pre-birth DNA testing?,"I'm on mobile so sorry for any grammatical or formatting errors. 

So I reside in Michigan my ex gf is pregnant with whom we both believe is my kid. The issue is that I believe she has a mental illness. She can't hold a job nor does she have any motivation to better herself. She has no G.E.D. and no money. Being in a relationship with her was TOXIC. 

She lives in a chaotic environment and her grandmother is verbally abusive. When the baby is born it will be in her small cluttered room in a pack and play. 

While on the other hand I have my own place with an extra bedroom. I work full time and go to school full time for a BBA in accointing. I save 200 dollars every paycheck with excellent health benefits with the company I work for. 

I believe that I would be the best fit parent for the child, but because we are not married I have no rights therefore, I have to get ""proof"" that I am the father. This involves DNA testing. 

I'm afraid that if I don't establish paternity asap then I will be automatically considered ""lazy"" by the court system because she is not allowing me doctor visitations, and she currently has me blocked through all forms of communication. I was told that she posts badly about me on social media as well. 

Before I get an attorney I am curious about pre-natal DNA testing. Does anybody know if you can get a court order for this before the baby is born so I can know and have proof asap that he's mine? I seriously can not picture my child being raised in that household it makes me want to throw up honestly. 

If anyone has any information or advice please feel free to comment. 

EDIT: With all of the deadbeat fathers out there I'm surprised that I'm getting my a** handed to me here on this sub.

If they have security cameras and was caught, will they call the police? What happens in situations like this? 
I don’t plan on doing this again. I actually want to take the items back but talk about drawing attention to myself. I have NO EXCUSE for what I did and am ashamed of myself. I have a lot of stress going on in my life and maybe that’s why I did it. Please don’t lecture me on how wrong it was, because i know it was horrible.

Its a pretty simple situation and I think I'm not getting the fair end here. 

On my day off (after a 10 day work streak), post a long day of skiing the best snow we've had all year, I bellied up to the bar while my partners finished riding. I started to drink. 

When my buddies arrived, I already had a pretty solid buzz; Half from libations and half from the epic day of skiing. 

I welcomed them in and they took seats at the bar. One of my buddies let me know there was a conditions reporter sitting at a table about 20 ft away from the bar. A conditions reporter works for marketing and thier job is to post attractive blurbs on our web site sumerizing the snow and trail conditions. This one in perticular has really ruffled my feathers. For weeks, she's been out right lying about the conditions. It's upset a lot of staff, and even more patrons. I have people yell at me, directly, because they drove from SF bay to the resort, a 3+ hour trip, based on this girls reporting. Upon arrival, they're obvioulsy disappointed. 

Welp, in my elevated state, I spoke up. They weren't kind words, but they were the truth. I told her she doesn't deserve to be published and her lies are such garbage. It went on, and my language got colorful. 

Her boyfriend (?) got out of his chair and rushed me. My buddy stopped him, but he was able to get ahold of me and shake me a bit. No punches. The bartender, a friend I respect, told me to chill out and immediatly did. He's a solid source of reason, and I rested because he's almost always right. 

We close out, grab our gear, and my buddy takes me home. 

I come to work the next day, and I have to help with a big group getting rentals. Turns out her office is in this rental building. 

Later that day, she went to HR and said she feels threatened at work. She felt extra threatened because I was so close to her office (I usually work right on the snow all day). 

My manager called me off and said we've got a meeting with HR. Boo. 

I went in and tried to describe my side. It was, admittedly, blurry. 

I'm told there will be an investigation and I need to stay out of that rental office for the time being. That's okay with me, I was doing that work pro bono anyhow. 

I was never really ""suspended."" I was still being scheduled on busy days and for specialized projects. Projects that I could do better (or I was the only available for) than other employees. 

Things were cool for about a week, then this reporter shows up, unnanouced and uninvited, into my work area. I ignored it, took it as a good sign, and kept with my day. 

Now I'm being told by my immediate boss I should resign before we meet with HR. Its taken nearly 2 weeks for the HR rep to make an appointment to see us. I was working the entire time. 

The HR rep said she was going to gather witness reports and make a descion. She hasn't even tried to contact anyone on my behalf. All the reports are from the conditions reporter's friends. My buddy that I skiied with all day, and who drive me home, saw that dude come up and try to fight me. HR hasn't even talked with the bartenders. 

Is that all it takes for me to lose a job? Just a compliant about feeling threatened? I have never ever been in any trouble here. Quite the opposite: Our survey site has about 30 very high reviews from customers about me over the past few years. I've been employee of the week a few times. My managers know me as a dedicated and extremely hard worker, more than willing to get it done. I've never even missed an optional training. As a matter of fact, soon I'll have an accreditation that puts me pretty high in my industry. 

I've been given the chance to quit before I get fired. I don't really want to collect unemployment, but I need to consider that now, too. 

Do I quit? Do I need to lawyer up? Should I fight it and run the risk of not being hired at this resort again? Does it make a difference this was my day off? Why isn't she getting witness statements that could help me?

E: I just read this post again for the xth time. I want to let y'all know I'm not proud of myself. I'm frankly embarrassed. I don't drink often, and I let the booze take control. That's not an excuse. As soon as I was called into the HR office, I told the manager I really want to find this girl and apologize directly to her (which they said is strictly forbidden, I get that). I really love this resort, and I could get a job in a day at another one around the area, but that's not what I want. I have a solid support staff and I some good return clientele. "

My friends sister is 25 but she still lives with her parents because she has down syndrome. We were talking the other day while I was at his (my friend's) house and we could have had sex but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to have sex with her (legally).

I got scammed of 21,700 by citibank

Hello reddit, a few months ago I tried to purchase a 2007 bmw z4 M coupe online. They were very nice over the phone, went through all the steps a dealer would, send me legitimate looking contracts and documents. I went ahead with the sale. I wired $21,700 to a major national bank in Miami, FL and was told to wait till friday for delivery of the vehicle. The vehicle never showed up.
 Shorty after the website went down and the phone was disconnected.
 Uh oh.
 I tried everything to get the money back from wire reversals (he already cleaned out the account) to CFPB complaints. I tried police reports, online report to the FBI cyber crimes division. I tried the FTC. The major well known national bank sent a hold harmless agreement to my bank to initiate the wire recall but the account was cleared out so there was nothing to send back. Even they admitted it was a scam! I only did the wire because it was going to a major national bank and not western union or moneygram. Why do I have this burden when allowed a scammer to use them as a front? I even emailed the board of directors and the CEO herself! At this point my bank has given up, The scammers bank wont talk to me anymore, and I cant find a lawyer that will take this on. Im in the Air Force active duty and have spoken to the base lawyers and they told me im screwed. Any help?"
312,312,"Moved countries, landlord wouldn't let out of old lease.","I rented an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin for a 12 month lease. I switched universities in December and am now living in another country for the time being. I told the manager of the building that I would be moving in December/January, and I would have to break the lease. He said I could sublet the apartment. I looked for anyone interested, but no one was willing to pay the outrageous rent. Fair enough. I told the manager of the building this, and he said not to worry as he's sure someone will come by in December or January at the latest in search of an apartment. The apartment was cleared out, I left the keys inside, and went on my merry way. 




Fast forward to April, I haven't heard anything from the manager and assumed he had quickly found someone... Then I get an email saying I owe them 4 months worth of rent. I email the manager saying he never informed me he stopped looking/couldn't find anyone to take the apartment when he knew the situation. I'm in no financial position to pay 2 rents and pay off 4 months worth of rent on a place I don't live in. I receive an email back from ""N"", who I assume is the manager's higher up, stating it was my responsibility to find someone for the apartment and I owe them this money. She then sent me an email stating the apartment had used more utilities than it should for the past quarter (the months the apartment was empty), and if it exceeded the maximum amount, I would be charged for that too.




I'm confused on what to do or what I can do. I couldn't keep paying two rents. I informed the landlords/managing company ahead of time. I was reassured they would find someone immediately and not to worry about it. Now I'm being told I have to pay rent on it AND that the utilities bill is higher than it should be... Even though the apartment should be empty and the utilities shouldn't be being used (besides the fridge which I don't think is $450 worth of utilities). 



Do I have any legal grounds to defend myself? I physically cannot pay it as I'm a broke student with racked up debt, and my cosigner is my mother who is just as poor as I am.

314,314,"I lied and said I hooked up with a girl at a party, now the whole school thinks I'm a rapist, please help me","I am 17 years old, a senior in high school, live in Michigan  and a virgin. School started last week and there was a big party on Friday night. Under normal circumstances I would have never been invited but I let it slip that I could cop Xanax for the party. This is the first in many poor decisions. 

Okay, so I'm basically a nerd I have a few buddies but that's it. We're not cool enough to get drugs under normal circumstances but what I did was order LEGAL clonazolam powder. It's a research chemical and a benzo just like Xanax so what I did was I got this pill press too and I pressed the powder to look kind of like Xanax bars. I figured no one would know the difference since most pills out there are pressed anyways. I brought my %100 legal pressed pills to the party and I was right kids couldn't tell the difference. I ducked up again when pressing the pills I made them way too strong.

So there's this girl I've had a crush on all summer. She took a pill and was drinking too. Not everyone took my phony pills but the kids who did got super fucked up including my crush. Keep all of this in mind. Okay, so I brag to my buddies who were not invited that I hooked up with this girl when I definitely did not. I didn't think they'd tell anybody, but they immediately called me on my bullshit and took it way too far. My ""best"" friend who's sister is a freshman and good friends with my crushes younger sister well he told his baby sister that I hooked up with her and she told my crushes sister and it got back to my crush who apparently blacked out that night and freaked the fuck out because she thinks I took advantage of her at some point during the party. Everyone believes this even my ""friends"" think I'm a rapist. I didn't even go to fucking school today because my phone has been blowing up with random numbers calling me names, outright threatening me etc. I deleted all of my social media because of the same thing. Guys were threatening to kick my ass.

I have no idea what to do. What if she actually tries to press charges against me? I'm fucked. "

316,316,[CO] how legally binding are spay/neuter contracts for puppies?,"I'm researching getting a labradoodle puppy (allergies) for my family. I've noticed almost all the local breeders have some type of spay/neuter contract. I don't plan on breeding the dog, but it doesn't sit right with me. 

The agreements read that if the dog is not neutered by 9 months of age (with written proof sent in) the dog is to be surrendered back to the breeder along with $7,000 in 'damages'. Original payment for the dog (1500) is also surrendered, of course. If the dog becomes intentionally or unintentionally pregnant before it is spayed or nuetered, the dog and all the puppies are to be surrendered to the breeder the dog came from along with that 7k fine. To have 'rights' to an intact dog these breeders are charging 10k.

I'm wondering how enforceable this contract is? We're also military, if that matters, so we'll be crossing state lines before that 9 Mos is up.

I'm not looking to swindle anybody or get into dog breeding, but this feels kind of ridiculous. Maybe I just view my dog's balls differently. "

One day she left and said she’s be back around 6pm and wasn’t back until 4 am and she broke up with me right when she walked in the door. I was devastated. I begged for her back over and over and over. She said her mind was made up. 

So today when she left I looked at her laptop. Turns out it was synced with her messages and she had been sleeping with a guy for over a month. She said terrible things about me and said she would dump me kick me out and take our mutual pet. I say mutual because we always split the cost but the insurance and the vet gave him registered to me , but rightly it is hers a well. I took out pet, took all the stuff I thought was important and leftZ I took nothing of hers. Or damaged anything of hers I am currently in a hotel. She won’t stop calling. I called her a lot of names like a bitch and a slut but now I won’t answers .

So I know I am weak and a piece of work, but please help me I have never been this hurt and I have never done anything like this.

319,319,"Traded in too many iphones to Apple, Got banned from shopping in-store. Still have $6000 in Apple Store GCs they won't let me spend.","Long story short, took advantage of the MetroPCS free iPhone 6s deal.
Traded in somewhere between 80-100 phones for $200 GC each back in December.  Typically 10-12 at a time between many Apple stores in the Bay Area.  Promo changed slightly end of Dec early Jan where you were required to make purchase with trade-in for full $200 value, or opt for $100 GC instead.  So with future trades, id buy apple watches, then return them to receive full $200 back in a GC.  Total count of phones traded in somewhere between 150-175 maybe.

Yes it was a lot of work, and I kept busy signing up at many metroPCS etc.  Over 30k in Apple GCs most of which I sold off.  Now recently, on my last return of Apple watches in Sacramento, manager called Loss prevention at corporate... Came out and told me they will return my watches, but I will no longer be able to do any trade ins or returns related to trade-ins at any Apple store in the state. This was a week ago.

As of today, I went to Apple store Valley Fair to go return an Iphone and airpods (This guy wanted to buy them from me but flaked) and right before I was able to return, the senior manager came out and told me that I am not allowed to do any business in the store.  It even got worse because the two people I was meeting to sell giftcards to were unable to purchase anything from Apple because of their ""association"" with me.

Obviously I'm no saint.  I abused this promo to the fullest extent to profit.  But I broke 0 laws and did not violate any terms and conditions.  Most Apple stores were fine with what I was doing but it took one rep and one phone call to shut me down.

So now I have 6k In gcs that they won't let me use... and since these hold actual value, is it legal to prevent me from spending them?  Obviously I can shop online but I will have a hell of a time combining GCs, and what if I was a dumbass who doesn't know how to shop online?

In any case, I called Apple and senior advisors told me they cant do anything to lift the ban because it was stores discretion , yet the apple reps told me to call Apple.

So any info would be great.  Thanks :)"

I had only taken Xanax but release papers say nothing about that and also spelled my name incorrectly. I'm annoyed because this all costs money and I was not overdosing on illegal drugs. I don't think I should have to pay any of this because I said to the paramedic many times that I was not overdosing and I was definitely awake.

327,327,Can urgent care refuse debts paid in pennies,"Arizona:

I had a 1 month lapse in healthcare coverage during a time when I had a severe allergic reaction, I went to an urgent care facility, talked to a nurse for a bit, and was basically told to just go to the ER, that they couldn't help me. 

This same urgent care were the ones that gave me medication that I was severely allergic to.

So I went to the ER and incurred hundreds of dollars in debts, which I will deal with later, but:

The urgent care still charged me for the visit. I tried to dispute that with them since they basically did nothing for me but they said because I spoke with the nurse that I owed them money. 

So I owe them money. Obviously I'm pissed, and you can judge me for this all you want but I would like some advice here.

I want to pay the bill in pennies. I know that private business can refuse certain forms of payment for services not yet rendered but 

Can they legally refuse legal tender such as pennies for the payment of medical debts?

328,328,Does a mom have to give back child support if DNA proves the wrong dad paid?,"So let's say I have a friend ""Mary."" She was hooking up a few different guys, nothing serious, and got knocked up. She wasn't positive who the dad was but decided to settle down with the most stable guy (let's call him ""Bob"") who could give her baby the best life.

They were on again off again and ""Mary"" didn't put ""Bob"" on the birth certificate when her baby was born because we were ""off again"" at this point of time. We lived together for a while, ""Bob"" was a jerk, and they broke up. ""Mary"" started getting child support money from ""Bob.""

After they broke up ""Mary"" reconnected with ""Tom,"" who she had been hooking up with at the same time as ""Bob."" ""Bob"" finds this out and because he is a vindactive asshole he tells me he wants a paternity test to prove our son is his. He also says that because he isn't on the birth certificate he doesn't have to pay, and that ""Mary"" has to give back what he paid. 

That would never happen right? I told him it doesn't matter what he can prove because he was the babies father all this time and it's in the baby's best interest now that he continue to pay for our support.

""Mary"" is pretty sure ""Tom"" is actually the father, but ""Bob"" was the one who raised the baby. He got all the perks of being a dad and gets to spend time with the baby. The baby is HIS son in that since, no matter what the DNA test says. Right?

So would the court agree that DNA doesn't matter anymore because ""Bob"" is already the established dad?

330,330,My job is asking for FMLA forms while my mom is dying - do I have to comply?,"I work in Maryland, and my mom is in Kentucky. She has terminal cancer and has gone downhill quickly in the past week. I flew in on Sunday to spend time with her (she had been in the hospital over a week at that point) while I still can.   


I'm not sure how long I'll be here. At first, we thought she might be getting a little better and leaving the hospital, so I was planning a short trip. But, she's only got worse each day and hasn't been able to eat really in over a week and hasn't passed any food out the other end at all. So, I've decided to stay longer, but I'm still not sure how long. I don't know if she will recover and go home, it seems unlikely, but still possible. Or, she could decline quickly any day and pass - and then I'd need to be here for arrangements, services, and dealing with her assets and all that. I'm 43 and my mom is 68, I've never been through anything like this before.  


The people I work with have known the situation for a while (she's been fighting cancer for over a year). I let them know when I was traveling in on Sunday and my boss, and my boss's boss all told me just to go and not worry about work (I work in an office setting). But, today I contacted my boss and let them know I'd be out all week instead of just part of the week. Then I (maybe made a mistake) and asked if there was anything I needed to do with HR for being out an extended amount of time. My boss said they'd check and get back to me.   


HR is now involved and wants me to fill out Family Medical Leave Act forms. There is one form just for me that asks for a return date (which I don't really know, but can put something down). But then, they have a second form that they want my mom's doctor to fill out. I've not even met her doctor in person yet, only over the phone. She's supposed to be at the hospital today and I feel awful asking the person who is taking care of my dying mom to take time to fill out this form that feels to me like a ""get out of school"" card.   


The form is:  OMB Control Number: 1235-0003   


It asks for details of her medical conditions, and frankly questions I find insensitive and insulting like:  


* Will the patient be incapacitated for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment and recovery? 
* Estimate the beginning and ending dates for the period of incapacity:  
* Explain the care needed by the patient and why such care is medically necessary: 
*  Explain the care needed by the patient, and why such care is medically necessary: 
*  Describe other relevant medical facts, if any, related to the condition for which the patient needs care (such medical facts may include symptoms, diagnosis, or any regimen of continuing treatment such as the use of specialized equipment): 

It's hard enough dealing with what my mom is going through, and to ask all these stupid and intrusive questions just adds insult on top of that. And, I really want to be focused on her, not covering my ass to get out of work. Don't these questions also violate HIPPA regulations? Why should my job know the details of my dying mom's health condition? Am I just being over-sensitive to this? Do I need to comply with these forms or risk not being able to use my sick leave?

I got into my car, not realizing that they were parked there and while talking to my son, accidentally tapped the side of my car.

This happens to me a lot because I do not use plastic bags so sometimes I carry out in my hands (in this instance I totally understand!), but sometimes I put in my purse or my reusable bags and I get a ton of questions. IMO, it's dehumanizing to have to show my receipt every time for something I legally purchased. This happens to me 2x a week. 

I'm of the understanding that the store can't legally force me to show my receipt, but they could call police if they felt there was any shoplifting going on & then I would of course be required to comply. Does this vary by state?

A security guard caught them and they tried to explain, but he wasn’t listening to a word they were saying. He banned them from the mall for a year, and said he was definitely presses and didn’t believe them. 

So, we really don’t know about this stuff and we have a few questions.

How do we find out if he’ll be pressing charges or not? Will the police call us? If he is, how do we get it out from our record? Do we need a lawyer? How much would that lawyer cost? Do we need a really good one?

335,335,"Specifics of traveling abroad (Middle East and Europe) with drugs (in this case, scheduled meds: Tramadol and Lyrica)","Hi everyone, I hope this is the right forum; I'll go straight to the point, I invited my parents to travel to Israel, Jordan and Italy, anyway, I'm taking tramadol and Lyrica daily, and a lot and the travel will last around 15 days, this means I will have to take A LOT of Tramadol and Lyrica; also, my parents don't know about this, so I was wondering, how could I take the meds I need without any problems? If carry them with me will I be checked? If they check it would be really embarrassing, I won't have a legitimate reason to have them and my parents will find out and I don't want that; I was thinking, since I'm from Mexico, maybe they will decide to check everything I have, so how could I get past security with my stash of the meds I take? I'm not trying to smuggle anything and not willing to do anything illegal, it's just the meds I take because I'm an addict. I was thinking about putting them all in bottles of other harmless meds, but supposing I do that, would this work? The best for me would that no one looked or checked my meds, but as I said since I'm from Mexico and I'll travel to a Muslim country and Israel, I really don't know if this would work, on the other hand, Tramadol and Lyrica have low abuse-potential and aren't scheduled everywhere (in Mexico they aren't, they're sold over-the-counter); since I'm not smuggling anything illegaly (I'm not going to insert them in my anus) I guess I just want to know what would be the odds of them checking what I carry in my pockets or my luggage and which would be a better option. Any input or thoughts would be really appreciated, because I'm really really worried about all this.

Thanks in advance and have an excellent day!"

339,339,Son concerned about his father’s constitutional rights.,"This might be pretty lengthy. 

TL;DR My father is being held in Parker County Jail in Texas, USA for possession of less than a gram of marijuana. He’s been there for over a year and I’m strongly considering suing Parker County for violating my dad’s 8th amendment rights.

I’m not really well versed in law, to be completely honest. I know most of the Constitutional rights including the Bill of Rights, such as amendments I, II, IV, etc,. My dad was a heavy equipment operator for a company that worked in both Missouri and Texas. As I’m sure most people know, Missouri recently fully legalized marijuana for recreational use. Before that, it was legalized for medical usage. My father had a medical card and regularly smoked marijuana to help with nerve damage, arthritis, and anxiety. He brought some with him to Texas when he went for a job down near Arlington, TX. His nerve damage had been really bad so he took some with him. He was caught speeding and told the cops he had marijuana on him, which they promptly detained and arrested him and took him to Parker County Jail. After many attempts to get parole, a proper lawyer, and a legitimate court date, he still is in the jail and has been since January 2022. This is cruel. He has 4 children in total. 2 boys and 2 girls. His daughter and son whom are under the age of an elementary student, barely remember anything about him. I want to know if it would be worth it to pursue a case against the county or the state for holding him for so long for a simple small amount of marijuana, in which most other states he would’ve been written a ticket for.

Any help is appreciated. I miss my dad very much.

EDIT: I did leave some small details out.
He was only going 10 over the speed limit.
We have hired 3 different lawyers all of which overcharge us and do nothing for him. 
One of the lawyers we spoke to said he would’ve been released by now if he was arrested in any other county besides Parker. That’s what the lawyer told me and I have no other evidence but that, admittedly.
He was only charged with possession. There was no DWI charge."

343,343,"Being screwed because of an ""AS-IS"" policy at a Pawn Shop","I'm in South Carolina

Alright, so 40 hours ago I purchased a Macbook and 2 Calculators from a small family run pawn shop.  I really went in there for the Calculators, but the laptop was right on the counter and was a pretty good deal so I picked it up as well.

The laptop wasn't plugged in, so I asked the person at the counter about it, and he said that it works perfectly.  The only reason they are selling it for so cheap is because they've had it for a while.

I brought it home and powered it on - the laptop's battery was broken and didn't hold a charge at all.  I thought it was no big deal, and I'll just bring it back to them the next day.

So I walked in, and *kindly* asked the lady if I could exchange or return the laptop because it was broken.  She said they had a no return policy, and all of their items are sold as is.  I told her that the person working the counter said the laptop worked great, and that I would not have purchased the laptop if I knew that the laptop was not working.  She mentioned that she *knew* the laptop battery was not working properly - but they still sold it because it was still ""Working great"".  We had an argument on the definition of ""broken"", and how the laptop technically wasn't broken because it still worked fine when plugged in.  I told her that her employee assured me it was working, and how her employee misled me into purchasing the computer.

Her husband than came from the back room and began arguing with me over the ""As-is"" policy, and how I shouldn't have purchased a used computer if I wanted to use it off the charger.  He said that laptop's batteries die after a couple years, and how it was stupid for me to think that this Macbook's battery should have worked.  He said whenever you buy a used laptop the battery will not work, and you have the factor the cost of a battery into the price (WTF).  

The old lady at the counter then asked me how old I was - I said 16, and she said ""You would understand what we're saying if you were older"".  I immediately left the store - almost in tears because I couldn't believe what just happened.

I came back about an hour later with my dad - as you can expect the husband was *much* more respectful when my Dad came in.  He said he could do a store credit towards anything in the store.  I refused, and my dad said he thought a refund would be the only fair thing.  The guy disagreed, and said he would talk to his employee and call my dad with a resolution.

Well my dad got a call from the Pawn Shop an hour or so ago, and they basically said Store Credit is the only option.  The person on the phone acknowledged that the employee said the laptop worked, but they have an As-Is policy so it doesn't matter.  They also said I was no longer allowed on their property, and the only way to receive/spend the store credit is to have an adult use it for me.  

What are my options?  Would a credit card chargeback be possible in a situation like this?  How would I return the laptop to them?  Can I get in trouble for posting multiple reviews to Google/Yelp or writing about them on social media?  Are they honestly allowed to sell multiple laptops with broken batteries without telling people or accepting returns?

I also want to add that I wasn't rude/threatening or anything to the people in the store.  I work in CS and would never be rude to any retail worker.  I was frustrated more than anything - but was not rude in any sense to the workers in the store.  I don't understand why I wouldn't be allowed in the store - especially to spend store credit that they are giving me.

346,346,Massachusetts: Guide me through legal custody and paternity rights. Im 17 and know nothing about the law.,"So yeah got this girl pregnant. She's 26 weeks along. Apparently her parents support her. They're mad but they recognize theres nothing they can do and are deciding to support and help her through. Same with my parents, told them like an hour ago. 

So I want to make this as easy as possible, preferably without an attorney.

She is not going to college and will probably stay home to take care of the kid. Shes enrolled in a college but well, she'll probably have to cancel.

Im still enrolled and 100% plan on going.

So this is what I want to do.

1) Get a paternity test (just in case).
2) I want to be able to visit in the weekends and on break until I graduate. Im also willing to pay child support. Then after graduation maybe I can work up to more custody. 

So how does my plan sound? I think I should be fine with support payments. Not sure if I can get the visitation rights like that. My ex and I are not on good terms but I think shell be cool with it. Shes pretty nice. 

Also will the courts give me some insane amount of child support? Ill probably be working a minimum wage job for a while. My parents do have money but I dont think that will factor in for CS payments.

Second, how can I legally establish paternity? Law might be rough since were unmarried.

Anything else I need to know? Courts cant force me to drop out of college right? I know its a dick move going and having her do most of the work but Im thinking about long term benefits. Getting a good degree and a good job will be far better in the long run and Ill try to visit every weekend.

**EDIT**

Wow. Okay. Let me clear some assumptions here. 

* Im not forcing her to quit college. She can go if she wants but I dont believe she will. I think she will at least take a year off. 
* She's not in this alone. For fucks sake, you guys think Im dumping her to be some single mom living at the poverty line waiting for welfare checks to survive? Fuck off with that bullshit. Unlike most teen parents, our parents arent kicking us to the curb and said they will support us both in every way. She'll have support from her parents and mine. For fuck sake, she has the money to buy a full time nanny. If she wants to go to college, NOTHING is stopping her. 
* Im not just going to be paying child support. If she needs more money, I'll be more than happy to dip into my savings/college fund for her. Not to mention, my parents will probably help me along with costs and child rearing too. We're not in this alone, alright? 
* Now I know what your going to say, YOUR PARENTS ARE RICH BRO!!! JUST LIVE OFF OF THEM BRO!! Yeah, I already have. For 18 years. Hell Ill probably rely on them for at least the next 5 years. I dont want to do that. I want to be able to get my own solid career, make my own solid money, and be able to support my daughter without relying on my family's wealth. Is that respectable? 
* Im not going to immediately go for 50/50 custody when I graduate. I know thats not realistic. I said I will work up to more custody once I graduate. Thats reasonable right? 
* Yeah I know the first four years of a kids life are tough. I know it will be difficult for her but that's how life is. I'm not forcing her to do anything she doesnt want to do. SHE wanted to keep this baby and she wants to support it, even if means putting college on hold. She could hire a full time nanny if she wanted, but she's not and it isnt because I'm forcing her to be my domestic slave. It's because its what she wants. Ill be there to support her. She's a million times better than me and I really will do my best to repay her kindness in the future. 
* Lastly, sorry for not being the embodiment of Jesus Christ everyone was expecting me to be. Ill clear that up. Im not Jesus. I'm just a teenager from a sheltered life trying to make things better for all parties.

**Okay. I thought some stuff through. I guess I can take a gap year or two until things are better and I can get more time like that. Then I can apply to some in state universities. There's a lot of good ones here too.**

347,347,Mom got $500k for child support and is going to keep it for herself [TX],"Growing up, I lived with my mom and only got to see my dad every other weekend. My dad wanted to spend more time with us but my mom wouldn’t let him, so my dad cut off child support. My dad and I are much closer now.

My dad’s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.

My mom wasn’t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.

Now my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids. I feel I am entitled to at least some of this money, as it was originally intended for me and would’ve been for me if I were under 18. Do I have legal recourse and can I expect to redeem some percentage of this payout?"

And I mean, like, he literally handed me a handgun and a clip full of bullets. I've been to a gun range like, once in my life over 20 years ago. I don't know anything about using guns. I don't even know if this thing is loaded. I just set it on a super high shelf in an unused closet and have ignored it since. (Don't worry, I have literally never had any children in my house and never plan to, I live alone and have social anxiety so I rarely even have visitors.)

If I try to give it back to my dad, he'll probably get upset and just want to teach me to use it instead, because he freaking loves guns. I don't want to learn how to use it, I don't even like touching it. I hate guns. Even if it would be legal to sell it or give it away, I really don't want to put another gun in redneck circulation. 

Would the police take it for me if I called ahead and said I'm bringing them an unwanted gun? Would it get my dad in trouble if the gun is in his name? If I can just quietly give it away to the police, I can just keep pretending to still have it, dad's happy, I'm happy, and the gun is off doing whatever police do with unwanted guns."

354,354,Lost job offer due to religious beliefs,"Ok so I had my interview on Wednesday. The job was through a third party recruiter and about half hour after the interview, the recruiter called me and told me that the company loved me and are offing me the job at an EXTREMELY nice salary. Much more than the industry standard. 

Now the tricky part was I did not expect it to go so quickly and was going to wait for the second round before talking about my Jewish restrictions. Since there was no second round, I had to tell the recruiter that I accept but would need to leave early on fridays for sabbath and that I will use vacation days for any religious holidays that I will be observing. He passed the message along 

I got a call back from the recruiter that the president of the company (the person who interviewed me) would like to talk to me about it. So we spoke on the phone, he sounded nice and cordial and said that it “should be fine”. 

I was supposed to receive the offer letter yesterday and now on Friday I have heard nothing from them. Additionally, they are in a huge rush to fill this position so the fact that they are suddenly slow has me concerned. If I do not get the job I will 100% know it is due to religion. Do I have any grounds to sue them?

Fact that might change things: the owner of the company is also a religious Jew. Much more religious than I am

355,355,I Was Fired for Pulling a Taser on an Aggressive Banned Customer,"I live in Ohio. I don't know if this is considered unlawful firing or not? Some of my friends say I should go after the company, but I'm not sure. 

&#x200B;

I've worked for this company with no issues from 2015-2017 before I filed a two weeks' notice. My friend (now assistant manager) asked me to reapply because things were getting rough and I've been working for them again since July 09, 2020. They fired me July 27, 2020. It's an adult store with only 48 stores around the country.

I told the man to leave. He said I was mistaken and said he had talked to our corporate office. I told him again to leave, and he got verbally aggressive and approached the counter. I told him again to leave or else I would tase him. He got angry and ran up to confront me. He pinned me against the wall before I could tase him. He exclaimed, “Stop it, stop it,” but I placed my nails into his arm that held my taser back. He backed away and complained that I had broken his necklace and hurled insults at me, but he left after I ridiculed him and he attempted to displace our outdoor trashcan. At some point my coworker had called our manager (Black, male, 50s) and we told him what was happening over the phone. I proceeded to clock in for my shift which had started at 2PM; it was approximately 2:15PM now. The man returned several minutes later with *a machete* and demanded I return his glasses, which I had knocked off his face earlier. I threw his glasses over the counter and mocked him again. Several customers were in the store. My coworker called the police. The man told me, ""Next time, bitch,"" and left again. My coworker called my manager again and *told* him to come in. 

&#x200B;

The police arrived within ten minutes, and my coworker and I recounted the events. We both said that we wanted to press charges against the man. 

&#x200B;

My manager arrived around 3:30PM-4PM. My coworker's shift ended at 3PM, but she didn't feel comfortable leaving me. She left once our manager arrived. He emailed the other stores a note I'd written recounting the details. My assistant manager (White, female, 30) came in at 5PM, not knowing what had happened. We told her. Our manager left. I told my assistant manager to inform our other coworker (White, female, 20s) so she wouldn't be in the dark, either. Around 7PM, our regional manager (White, male, late 30s-early 40s) called to ask me to explain what had happened. I told him that I had not immediately called the police as both myself and the assailant are Black, and there is currently a civil rights movement going on about police brutality against Black people. My shift ended at 9PM and I left an extra taser and pepper spray with my assistant manager. 

&#x200B;

On July 27, 2020 at 11:33AM, I received a call from my manager who told me that HR wanted me terminated because I had a taser. I texted my assistant manager and two coworkers to tell them I had been fired over the debacle and that it had been nice working with them."

It's his official representative page not his personal page.  I was blocked because my comments were ""harassment and not sincere questions or honest debate"".  Which is a bunch of baloney because a lot of my posts where links to articles or reports disputing information on his page, any questions I did ask were left unanswered while other responses were commented on by the page.  All of which were deleted.

  
I had contacted the MN ACLU 7 weeks ago as of today and haven't heard back.  Their confirmation stated: "" It typically takes us 4 - 6 weeks to process complaints.

359,359,Job recruiter wasn't up front about drug screening until after I resigned from current job,"I've been in talks with a recruiter for the past couple of months regarding a job in another state. At one point during our discussions, the recruiter said there was going to be a background check. I asked them specifically what that entailed, and they said, ""oh you know, just standard background check, work history, criminal records, etc.""

So I decided to interview for the job. I passed the interview, was offered a job, and accepted it. After the timing of my start date was discussed, I submitted my two week resignation to my employer. That very same day, I began receiving emails from the background checking site the recruiting company uses. I filled out all the info and submitted it. Later that day, another email came in indicating there was another document to fill out. This one was a drug screening. Suddenly, I was nervous. I had just returned from a trip to a state where marijuana is recreationally legal, and I had consumed a lot. I knew there was no way I would pass the test. So, I called the recruiter and told them my situation. They stated that this had been an issue in the past, but since the job was in Colorado and it shouldn't be a problem. I told them they never mentioned to me that there would be a drug test and they apologized that they forgot to tell me. Thirty minutes later, the recruiter called me back with their supervisor on the phone. They started out by congratulating me on the new job and said they understood that I thought I wouldn't pass the test. They said, ""no problem, we will just delay taking the test for a couple of weeks to help you clear your system. If you get emails from HR, don't respond. We'll take care of it"" This seemed really shady to me. Then after the call, I received this text message from the recruiter:  


>""Hi - I've run into this issue a number of times being in Colorado where there's a struggle between state and federal laws. I know a number of people who have used products that allow them to pass drug screenings.

When I realized the link was to a site advertising fake penises and fake urine, I thought that this constituted fraud. I was not going to do such a thing. If anything, I would rather wait and clear my system naturally.

Well, it's been two weeks and tomorrow I have to take the drug screening before flying to Denver on Sunday. Just tonight, I took an at home drug test and it showed positive for THC, so I am pretty certain tomorrow's actual test will show the same.

If I don't get the job because of this recruiter's neglect for telling me these details up front, is there anything I can do legally? At the very least, if I do fail and don't get the job, I plan to send these texts from them to their HR representatives.

Had the recruiter told me at the beginning of our discussions a couple months ago, I would have not made the choices I did while in a state where marijuana is legal. Now I feel stuck. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
360,360,(USA) My daughter was molested at school,"My 5 year old daughter was molested by another 5 year old at her private school. The teacher was outside the classroom when this occurred so there are no adult witnesses. However when we brought it in they made a big show they were handling it (including sending out an email tot he parents and calling meetings with the social worker and children). But things degrade from that point. They led my daughter to say he didn't touch her inside her leggings (which she said multiple times before that meeting that he did). Also they evidently told all the parents who was involved and alienated us from the entire class and most of the school. On top of that they decided the touching was not overtly inappropriate and said they would give open passes to allow my daughter to talk to the social worker whenever she needs. Also the social worker was to take the students on lunch dates to foster friendships and work past this. 

However this is what has happened(within over a month) more bullying from the class. The parents of the children(there was another girl also molested) involved have alienated us. The teacher has also been dismissive and nasty to my daughter.I don't want to sue but I want to know what I can do, I'm already looking into other schools. But I am afraid this kind of thing will happen to other children and it is really just wrong. 

Side notes:The parents of the other victim and the molester, the teacher and the social worker are all friends from high school."
361,361,Parent's just closed selling their house. The owners of the house they were supposed to purchase in 2 weeks are apparently trying to declare bankruptcy.,"Connecticut USA.  

My parents have a contract to purchase a house form a couple they have since learned are underwater on their mortgage.  They believe to the tune of $100k.  The owner's bank has approved the sale despite this though we have been led to believe that at least some of the debt has not been forgiven.  They used to own a fairly prominent local business that failed about 15 years ago due to technological obsolescence.  We know that they had obtained a rental house\(despite a low credit score, local friends and business owners had vouched for them\) with the lease starting April 1 but have not moved in.\(as of May 2\)

My parents just closed on their old house yesterday.  They have arranged to rent the house for 2 weeks from the new owner until they close on their new house\(May 15\).   They had at one time atempted to arrange a simultaneous closing but were unable to get everyone's schedule to work.  They are mostly packed and ready to move by now.  They have already scheduled movers and painter to work on the house the week after closing.  They have working with architects on come sonsiderable renovations.

Yesterday my parent's real estate lawyer got a call from the lawyer of the owners of the house they are pruchasing saying that he thinks the owners are trying to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy.  This lawyer is a real estate lawyer and is not involved in the bankruptcy case. My parents lawyer suspects that they want to strenghten thier bankruptcy case by showing the underwater loan. This doesn't make much sense to me because a $100k debt on a house you no longer own or live in looks just as bad to me.  The only thing I can think of is that these people have accepted bankruptcy and now want to delay the sale so they can stay in their house at least as long as the proceedings which should last the summer\(i understand 90 days is normal to expect.\)  My parents will be homeless in two weeks while this couple\(who understandably are in hard times\) has essentially fucked them.  My parents are fairly well off and are not in danger of sleeping on the street, but this situation will be extremely stressful for them emotionally and will certainly cost them significant money to mitigate.  It could take many months for them to find a suitable house.

My parents are attemtping to meet with a local bankruptcy lawyer tomorrow to try to better understand what could possibly happen.  They tend to deal in hyperbole and I like to be the voice of reason so I'm looking for advice here to help them keep a relatively cool head.  They also are so emotionally devastated that they are questioning the desire to even buy this house \(potentially after considerable delay\)  This is a silly sentiment to me as they loved the house and have made a lot of plans for renovations compounded with the fact that there are no other houses on the market they are currently interested in.  Even if they found one, a 90 day closing is not unheard of due to seller needs."
362,362,"My landlord has intercepted UPS deliveries to prevent them making it to my apartment. Mgmt has even accessed my USPS box at least twice, and mail is being returned to sender.","**\[SEATTLE, WA\]**     

The USPS is aware that my friend (lets call her Susan) is receiving mail here, and have assured me they will deliver any and all mail addressed to her. However, much of her expected mail does not arrive. After following up with one sender, Susan's bank, we learned that someone had returned a mail piece containing a debit card to them. It happens to be that my building's management does not like Susan getting things delivered here. They have forbidden it and have made it clear that they will not allow any UPS or Fedex packages to make it through to her -nor any orders for pizza checking in at the front, or any other delivery  or service bearing her name. Not even if it is addressed in the care of myself.   To this end they have sent away groceries, received and then returned an important letter sent via UPS, intercepted said letter on a followup attempt and tried to physically keep it from me (before attempting to lock me out of the building after I finally took receipt of the thing), and have lied to me when I've inquired about deliveries. 

I mentioned missing mail and that my mailbox had been accessed at least twice. The first indication someone other than my mailman and I were inside of my mailbox was a poorly written correspondence to my carrier to not deliver anything to Susan. This was signed illegibly and placed in my mailbox, presumably by my landlord as he is the only other person with keys.  The other incident was the little name tag inside the box had been replaced with one lacking Susan's name.

This has been incredibly galling and an initial report made to the Post Office came to a disappointing conclusion.  Ten days after making my complaint I received an email  which failed to address any of my concerns but nonetheless declared my issue to be resolved and assured me mail delivery would return to normal. I called to reopen the issue with them, indicating that perhaps I had not conveyed the problem clearly because the email seemed a bit confused and the problems had  in fact grown worse. The gentleman was receptive and they have reopened this complaint. Nonetheless I am concerned that nothing will be accomplished, I have had unsatisfying experiences appealing to the various authorities in life; from the police, to the City of Seattle, to the United States Post Office, it never seems to me that I am getting a fair shake. I don't know how to best advocate for myself here but I feel I am being harassed by my landlord and that his behavior at best exists on the fringes of legality and at worst is completely illegal. I have no money whatsoever, although I may be able to secure assistance from a family friend in affording a  lawyer.  My questions then: Regardless of any potential criminal charges (I'm not holding my breath) what are my chances of holding my landlord accountable in civil court? How would I go about finding an attorney to discuss this possibility with? Would such a consultation cost me money up front? Cure me of my naivety. Thank you and my apologies for this messy ramble ."
363,363,Advise needed about monitoring someone's compter,"I am in the D/FW area of N TX

I need legal advise concerning something I am wanting to do.

Here is the situation...

I have a roommate who can't afford to pay for his own internet account. I am paying for a mid-range level package through Time Warner (now Spectrum). The problem with my roommate is that he has no filters what-so-ever when he is online, he clicks on all hyperlinks he comes across whether they are in emails,. chats, etc, clicks on pop-ups, clicks on shady computer ads, visits many porn, conspiracy theory and religious website that catches his interest (as those site groups are notorious for spreading all kinds of virus', malware, spyware, etc). I have repeatedly told him what he needs to do in order to keep his PC as clean as possible, only to have my lessons go in one ear, bounce around his brain a few times and fly out the other ear faster than the words went in.

Due to his lack of online intelligence, I have, after repeatedly fixing problems on his current PC and after destroying 5 other PCs and one laptop, turned on parental controls on his PC which do no work (even though he complains that what he is trying to do requires admin permissions (which I don't give unless he can explain to me why he needs a new program or new software installed)). I want to download and install a few good Net Nanny programs on his comp to monitor and track what he does online. The last time I was on his PC was 2 months ago to install the most current windows updates. When I install updates, I do go over his installed programs and scanning kits to make sure that they are up to date, clean out all but the most current restore points and to see how much free space is on his HDD (at that time he had 215Gb of free space). Today as I was heading to work, he called me to his room to see why his computer was running slow, after a quick check, I found that he has less than 1.5Gb for space left on his PC. I told him that I can't even work on his computer until Wednesday at the earliest and before I begin to work on his system, I needed a list of every site he has visited (he has no idea what browser history is).

Honestly I am afraid to get on his computer as I may see things I don't want to see. I did inform him that if I can, I am going to install software on his PC that will let me know on a regular basis what sites he has been to, links he has clicked or tried to click and what he tried to download and install. 

Right there is where I am needing advise on. I am paying for access to the net for both of us and I am wanting to know if I can install monitoring software on his PC to cover my tail to make sure that he isn't doing anything bordering on or is illegal. I have tried googling this and have found one case where a homeowner in Wisconsin was convicted of receiving and transmitting CP on their unsecured Wi-Fi network.

I have also informed my roommate that once I fix his PC, I will no longer help him in the future as he can not, will not listen and accept any and all advice and lessons about safe internet browsing.

As an F.Y.I., 7 years ago, I kept his hide out of jail for credit card and mail fraud after UPs, Fed-Ex and the USPS dropped numerous packages on the front porch of our former home (at least 8 55"" LCD TVs, clothes, random electronics and various other goods) as I was doing homework for one of my ISS classes. After I talked him into letting me and copy see his IM logs and emails concerning what he received and will be receiving, taking photo images of what was delivered and stopped off at the police to report what I thought he was getting into against the law on my way to class. 

TLDR: The police was notified about the roommates activities, they came by while I was at school after reporting my suspicions talked to the roommate and confiscated all packages as it was determined that he was roped into taking part in credit and mail fraud.

In the initial 5.5 years since, he has been behaving himself online and not doing anything stupid (save for destroying many computers). In the past 1.5 years he has destroyed 1 laptop and two PCs by doing things online that he shouldn't be doing. His last PC is in storage with 3 others that were similarly destroyed by him installing numerous cloud servers, computer maintenance programs, etc.

Any help that will lead me in the right direction would and will be greatly appreciated."

Any advice as to how long they can detain her or if we can get a hearing on monday in order for the judge to grant bail. Any resources that can be passed will help.

365,365,Another trial for my divorce??? [MA],"My ex is crazy.  We had a full divorce trial last year and she has since filed for an appeal and then stayed the appeal so she could file for modifications.  

Now we have another pre-trial coming up and I am suppose to write up another memorandum.  I feel like I am going through this all over again.  How is she allowed to do this? 

I want to move on with my life.  

I don't see how our legal system can work like this.  Going through the same divorce twice?

Can I get her lawyer thrown off the case?  She knew she didn't serve me properly and also ignored my email asking if we had any upcoming hearings.  

Suggestions welcome (aside from just saying I need a lawyer).  I basically did this myself the first time around.

Thanks."
366,366,[WA] My boyfriend is wealthy and I'm pregnant. He wants nothing more to do with me. What legal recourse do I have?,"He's willing to pay child support, but he wants to pay only child support for the next 18 years. I don't have a lot of money and don't want to bring a child into the world on such limited means. He's staunchly anti-abortion, but if I don't get any further backing from him I plan to pursue one. I want to know how to make my position clear without making this seem like a threat, even though it kind of is one. Can I get in trouble legally for this, even though all I want to do is guarantee the best possible future for me and my child? I don't really have the money for a lawyer but will probably end up splurging. I want to get a good idea what to expect first so I don't waste everybody's time."

368,368,I need advice. Stole something at walmart worth about $25 but was stupid enough to buy something on my credit afterwards. Ontario,"I stole 2 electronics cables worth maybe just over $20 total that I needed but didn't want to pay for at the time. Took them out of their packaging and just put it in my pocket, leaving the packaging on random racks. Unfortunately I panicked and grabbed some pencils to buy, worth about 3$, which I paid for on my credit card. I heard walmart takes this stuff pretty seriously and I sure didn't make it hard for them to find me. Are they going to pursue this and if so what would I expect? Just a letter of warning or something? Should I go in and talk to the manager and try to pay for it now, about 4 days later or would that just make it worse? I'm 19 and in Ontario. No previous record or stealing at walmart."
369,369,Should/can I sue the IRS at this point? Still waiting on my 2019 return and 2021 stimulus payements.,"Been trying to handle my 2019 refund since November when I got an ID verify notice (at my old address, which they have still not updated). After calling almost everyday for over 2 months I finally got through to someone, who said it should be no more than 9 weeks until I get my refund (but that it will probably only be 2 or 3). Well, it has been around 11 weeks and nothing has shown up.

Anyways, after getting a credit card I was finally able to open an online account today (because they would not verify me with a debit card \*rolls eyes\*), my 2019 transcript says I did not file.

Turbotax can verify I filed, and the IRS sent me a notice after receiving my return. So the IRS should have no reason to act like they did not get my return.

What is my recourse?

Should I sue just to get the wheels moving? (this would be pro se, as my refund is less than attorney's fees would be and I don't qualify for the local clinic at SMU since I am not a respondent). This whole process is a drag to the point where I feel like a subpoena is the only way I can get them to do anything. I don't want to actually go to court, but they will not answer the phone and have no other way to contact them.

In addition, their online portal states I am not owed a stimulus payment based on my income I should be owed the full $2,000.

Note: I had to take out a loan as I had planned on using the projected income from my return to pay for a deposit. So I am accruing interest every day the IRS does not send me my money.

Edit: It has been 6 months since I originally filed (late July after an extension), I just figured COVID was making things go a little slow till I got the ID verification notice. From what I can tell from reading about tax court, 6 months seems to be the point at which I can sue.

370,370,My girlfriend who I was breaking up with turns out to be pregnant. What are my options?,"I've been dating this girl for a year now. She currently does not work, does not have a car, and has no money. I own a house, a car, and a decent job. She is currently living with me on lease agreement that she has never once fulfilled. I am currently the provider for both of us. She is the holder of every red flag and I honestly should have seen it coming, but I was dumb.

Well, about 3 months or so ago we sort of broke up. We are not fit and I'm tired of paying for everything and dropping everything to give her rides. I gave her a lease termination and told her she had 30 days to leave. Well, fast forward 30ish days she never left. I was prepared to go to court but as you guessed by the title, she's pregnant. I'm not sure if it's mine but I'm going to assume so by her word.

She's obviously not fit to be a mom. She has countless mental issues and needs to be on medication. She smokes weed like there's no tomorrow and I honestly feel like that's where my child support would go if it came to that. She relies on everyone else to do things for her and can barely take care of herself. She's currently smoking cigarettes still, but is trying to quit (she's been trying to quit for the past 6 months but has a mental breakdown each and every time she stops to the point where she becomes suicidal).

Once she's out of my house, she would be forced to move in with her mom, who is an ex-drug addict and just as bad as her. If this is my child, I wouldn't want her to be raised in that kind of enviroment.

As of right now, I would feel like a dick making her leave if it is my child, so she's still living here. We are still ""together"" just so that she doesn't freak out and do something stupid. However, I'm not living the rest of my life like this. If this is my child, what are my options? Is it possible for a father to gain full custody? How soon can this be done?

I live in Wisconsin."

Is there a sovereign status granted for individuals? (Does that change legal responsibility in any way?)

Unfortunately, living in Chicago there are riskier areas scattered throughout that can be difficult to avoid and I know having such a nice bike is likely to make me a target, even if I am currently riding it.

373,373,"I can prove without any doubt that my Bank has lied to me 20+ times over major events in the past few months. Their blatant lies have destroyed me financially, what options do I have (OH)","Hi Guys,

So I have multiple checking/savings as well as a credit card with a bank, lets call them FUBank.  FUBank recently got a major reward for being the ""most honest bank of the year"", however I have been lied to, slandered, and overall just bent over and fucked with a sandpaper condom by them.

Ive been with them just shy of a year, and in that time their lies have been like miniature nuclear bombs on my credit and finances.  I am able to prove a massive chain of lies and deception by their customer service, dispute, and customer advocate departments.  These lies were told over the phone, on recorded lines, and I would have no issue showing how these lies have cost me not only money but how they have negatively impacted my emotionally.

In addition to continuously lying to me I have been called a Liar by their company, right after proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was correct.  In this particular case a dispute agent claimed to call me and leave a voicemail before closing a dispute.  After explaining I never received it I was called a Liar, I then had my phone carrier print the phone records and low and behold, they never called.  I then sent them proof they never called and was called a liar again.  That one cost me a few hundred.

So I am at the point I want to retain a lawyer and subpoena the recorded calls, all correspondance, etc so that I can build a case. My questions are:

1) Should I be looking at lawyers locally or near their corporate headquarters?

2) Would I be wasting my time sending a letter to their legal department laying out my accusations and intent to try and settle this before getting a lawyer

3) How many legal hours would get tied up in this?  There is probably around 15-25hrs of audio to go through

Thanks as always!"
374,374,Public school student coerced into signing a document supporting a political organization,"My daughter is a high school student in Pennsylvania.  Yesterday one of her teachers presented her class with a document that is a pledge to support Black Lives Matter.  Not just in principle, but the wording of the document includes a pledge to physically participate in BLM activities.  According to my daughter, signing it was nominally optional, but the unambiguous spoken message was that anyone unwilling to sign it was racist.

Based on comments on a school parents' Facebook group, this is was not just one teacher's action. Parents of children in different classes and different grade levels are saying their children were asked to sign it too.  I don't yet know if the school's administration is behind it not, or if they are even aware of it.

To me this coerced political activity is *highly* inappropriate.  Some parents are going as far as claiming that it is illegal.  Is it?"

I am greatly ashamed and upset wth myself. I plan on telling my wife and working through the emotional/relational consequences there. My question here is this: how likely is it that this will come back to me legally? I went a little after lunchtime, parked in the rear parking lot out of view from the street. I did see a camera at the entry door, but none inside. There was only one woman there, that I saw. I never explicitly asked for the happy ending, it just sort of happened (although I certainly went there with that thought in mind-not trying to absolve myself here). I was there for probably 20 minutes, left in a rush of shame and embarrassment and got in my car and left. I paid with cash that was recently withdrawn from the bank. Of course my mind is coming up with all sorts of  paranoid possibilities where I could get caught after the fact. Is that possible? Is it likely? Should I be nervous about the police showing up at home or at work? I live in Texas. Just trying to prepare myself for all possible consequences. Thanks. "
376,376,Teacher told by administration to quit using gender neutral prefix,"My wife is a teacher at a public elementary school in the state of Georgia in the USA. She has, since beginning the job earlier this year, utilized the prefix Mx. on all documentation, communication, and public facing media regarding her position and responsibilities.  She does this as she is non-binary.

This morning, she was pulled from a class to have an impromptu meeting with the principal, vice principal, and a county HR representative to explain why she used the prefix, then told her to quit using it and to remove all traces of it. They did not say she has to go by Ms. or Mrs. but that if she didn’t want to use them, to use first initial and last name (J. Doe) instead.

Does this constitute gender discrimination? Should a conversation be had with the BOE or legal counsel?

She feels incredibly wronged by the entire situation. She is going to lay low about it in the mean time and contact her union representative."

She didn't drink from it when she came back in but there was definitely coffee in it so she might have later.

Today one of my friends texted me that someone found out about our prank and told the teacher. Our class didn't meet today so I didnt see the teacher so I don't know, and I won't see her until after the long weekend.

If this is true and the teacher found out, how bad of trouble could we be in? We're freshmen in high school (14/15 yo). One of us got an MIP once but we're usually good kids and good students.

378,378,Bipolar workplace discrimination,I have been an adjunct professor for 14 years. I was the first adjunct to win professor of the year. I have meets and exceeds on all of my reviews. Students and faculty typically like me. I am also bipolar and have crippling anxiety. I have had a problem with checking email. I get real anxiety when checking emails to the point that I can’t do it. This is really embarrassing for me. I rarely get an email directed towards me. But I have not responded in a timely manner to some. This is getting worse. This is causing problems. I have tried to explain to my chair and dean to no avail. I have requested a reasonable accommodation to be called if I can’t be reached by email. This request has not been honored. The problem is getting worse as a result. I have been put on unpaid status.

379,379,[NH] Can I be liable for child support in a foreign country (France)?,"Last year, I spent the summer abroad in France. I ended meeting a girl there and long story short she ended up getting pregnant. I absolutely had no interest in raising a child, as I am just a college student so I told her that I wasn't going to be supporting her and her child and advised her to get an abortion.

I've since returned back to the states. I've decided that I've had a ""financial abortion"", which I feel absolves me from responsibility here.

Despite my advice, she went ahead and had her child anyways. Recently, she contacted me on facebook and told me that she was having trouble supporting her child and that she was going to be seeing a lawyer to obtain child support from me. I told her that I had already decided that I wasn't going to be involved and she knew that from the start. I then proceeded to block her number, as well as social media accounts.

I thought by retreating from France, I'd be immune from child support payment, but now I'm not quite sure because there isn't much info available online regarding the topic.

Would it be possible for the French government to hold me responsible for child support even though I'm a U.S. citizen?

380,380,[TX] Conservative employer has created a hostile work environment for me because I'm liberal. Anything I can do?,"My boss owns his company and I work for him. Our work spaces are close by and he leaves his office door open and listens to the radio while he works and he keeps the volume turned up pretty loud. He doesn't listen to music, he listens to talk radio and podcasts. All day, every day. It's Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ben Shapiro, and a few others. It's annoying.

So I asked my boss a few weeks ago if he would mind closing his door or turning down the volume and he laughed and said ""hell no, I keep it turned up so you can hear it hoping one day you'll smell the roses."" He's always saying things like that because he knows I supported Bernie, then Hillary. He says that he doesn't blame me for being a liberal at 25, but if I'm still one at 35 it means I've got ""kangaroo dung for brains.""

I don't have an office, my desk is in the front of his office, so I don't have a door I can close. Well I decided to listen to my own podcasts on my computer. So the other day I was listening to Rachel Maddow and my boss came out of his office and heard it and told me to turn it off. I was a little shocked at first and he said that I could listen to ""music or other stuff,"" but he didn't want ""that liberal junk"" playing around him. I told him it was my phone and it was a free country and he laughed and said ""you're free to believe the wrong way, but you're not free to express it in my building."" 

So as I sit here on my lunch break I'm being forced to listen to conservative talk radio in the background, as I have been everyday. I am very uncomfortable and feel like he is pressing his political ideology on my against my will. It has actually started causing me to have anxiety. 

What can I do? I know the easy answer is to find another job, but the pay and benefits are far better than anything else in the area. What can I do to eliminate this hostile work environment?"
381,381,I Got A DUI....,"Hello, So in September I got a DUI and I would love any advice before my upcoming arraignment. I drank at about 10:30PM on the 18th of Sept with a friend before entering a night club. Now the worst part that got me was there had happened to be a perfect parking spot right in front of the club which was very rare ( IT WAS A CURSE IN DISGUISE). When I got out of the club it was about 1:30 AM ( I did NOT drink at all in the club because I'm low-key cheap lol) and I was still a little drunk I could feel it, so I had told one of my other friends which was not drunk let me ride with them until I sober up which he was obliged to do. He went and visited a girl at her house while I slept in his passenger seat while i took a nap and drank a bottle water. Eventually he came back to the car at 4:45am and woke me up to drop me back off at my car, which at the time I told him I felt fine now and no longer drunk since I hadn't drank since 10:30PM Night Before. He dropped me off at my vehicle which was parked again IN FRONT of the night club which was a horrible decision now that I look back on it. I pull out from the club parking lot at 5:00AM and a police officer immediately starts following me. Im fully aware of him as soon as I start driving because he's just riding me instantly, & now I'm making sure I'm going speed limit which was 30MPH according to my GPS home and I also had both hands on the wheel making sure not too swerve while keeping a watchful eye on the cop behind me. He continued to follow me for 5 minutes and at this time I'm not panicking because I feel totally fine in my mind and not drunk.  I continued to drive perfectly fine until he blurped, which I pulled over instantly. He told me he pulled me over for swerving in between lanes which was hilarious because there was no possible way, furthermore he also said my vehicle smelled like alcohol so I complied and did all his tests. I eventually got the breathalyzer portion which I blew a .10 which is .02 over the legal limit (Barley).  I went to jail for the night and since then my life has been hell, Ive been having to pay all these DMV Fees & DUI Class Fees (Which I Enrolled in), my insurance sky rocketed and all this just all happened after I got a $500 Speeding ticket two weeks before this incident. Im young 24 years old I don't have a ton of money I can blow at this time and affording a lawyer and paying 2 - 3k isn't not possible for me. Life has been screwing me lately aside from all these tickets & fees and I already learned my lesson 10 fold and I will never end up in this situation again, do you guys have any advice or helpful opinions? It would be greatly appreciated !"
382,382,Can a workplace say you can not use the “mothers room” if you are a guy?,"So, we have a room called the “mothers room” at work. There are two or three of these rooms in the building and I work for a large corporation. They are never used really ever. I know because I sit near it and watch the rooms remain unoccupied except when people occasionally use the sink to wash there hands. If a person has used it for breastfeeding, I would be shocked if I missed it, but it is possible obviously.

Well, today I used it for exactly that. I washed my hands. I was in it for no more than 2 minutes. I walked out and some women told me I am not allowed to be in that room. I will save the conversation but she did it twice, with a massive attitude, and I acknowledged what she said without agreeing or disagreeing. Side note, a coworker said many think she is a b#%*#, but that is a side note. She also doesn’t have a kid or breastfeeds, so I wasn’t stopping her from using it for those two minutes (I will save how I know this, but it is known).

Anyways, my question is not a “moral” question about using it, but a legal one. Can a workplace say that a man can NOT use a room designated or “dedicated” to mothers (it appears to be for breastfeeding)? I’m not saying for a man to occupy it for meetings, social time, or other things. I mean to use it for a couple of minutes to use the sink to wash there hands or other things for 2 to 4 minutes max?

Reason I ask is that this seems to be discrimination. I do not see any “fathers room” that is equal or equivalent to this room. Also, since we as a country (USA) just stated that a workplace or business can not tell a person what bathroom they are allowed to use based on appearances or assumptions, what gives them the right to tell me I can not use the room or sink or enter into said room?

To be clear, I am not interested in sitting in the room and preventing someone from using it who needs to breastfeed. I would only be washing my hands in there and drying them mainly. It would take a couple minutes max with the door shut. Maybe 4 minutes at max to even be extremely conservative about the number.

What is my legal rights to using this room? Can a coworker or anyone else tell me I can not use a room due to my gender or sex? Especially if an equivalent room is not provided?

Thanks you for any information on this.

EDIT: To be clear, this is in the state of North Carolina."

The loss prevention and/or stock boy caught me and took the items from my purse before I left but also took my Samsung tablet; I panicked in the moment and was willing to take it as a loss so as not get detained and booked it out if there.

So my question is, if they try to trace me from my info in my tablet can I can counteract legally with the fact I never took anything from the store but my property was actually taken by one of their employees on camera?

386,386,Harassed for Feral Cat Opinion,"I'm in WA, USA.

I recently posted an opinion about feral cats concerning the chick who shot the infamous ""Tiger"". I said it was a good thing to shoot feral cats, as long as they didn't experience pain (the shot was a good one, it's unlikely the animal would have suffered long). I said that given the opportunity I might shoot ferals in the field, and mentioned many people in rural communities do.

The post blew up with around 53 people responding and 8 harassing messages including death threats. Then I got an email from my university concerning a vague ""harassment"". I wasn't sure if they meant me, or if I was harassing (I didn't threaten anyone), so I thought 'I can take care of myself' and deleted it.

I got 2 phone calls a week ago. One from the college I attend, the other from that local police department. I no longer live in that area and am graduating from that college. My phone was dead at the time, and its unlikely I would have responded anyway. 

I'm kind of just ignoring this in the hopes it will go away. I mean, its a dumb facebook post. Yeah I got a little heated but why would that hurt me? Also the messages seemed to have stopped as of the 1st of May. 

I don't know if it will continue. How screwed am I, legally? What can they do to me? What should I do?"
387,387,Vaping Rights and School Policy,"I am from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida...

So a few days ago I am in school and during 5th period I go to the restroom. In the middle of using the stall, the fire alarm goes off and it startles me. So I stop in thee middle of peeing, zip up my pants, wash and dry my hands, and left the boy's restroom as fast as I could. I go back to my class room, grab my things, and head out through the nearest exit and meet up with my class outside of school.

We stay outside away from the school for about 20 minutes, then we all head back to our classes. As soon as I get to class, we all settle down and we end up not having to do any work because of the convenience of the fire alarm. Since I didn't have any work to complete, i thought that I could use my spare time to take a a nap. 5 minutes into my nap, security comes and pulls me out of class, searches me, then question me about what i did to set the alarm off. After searching me, they look through my book bag. When they look through my bag, they find a small bottle of vape oil in one pocket of my bag, and a vaporizer pen in the other. So now they suspect that I was the one who went into the restroom and vaped since I was the last one to enter and leave the restroom in the same time period that the fire alarm went off.

BUT, here's the thing. My vape pen and vape oil was in my book bag the entire class period. When I went to go use the restroom, I did not have my book bag with me. Therefore it couldn't have been me because I did't have anything on me that could have possibly that the smoke detector could have detected. I means yeah I have a vape but I never used it inside of school. And I never took even took it out of my book bag. So could they still falsely accuse me of vaping in the restroom and setting off the alarm? And if they can, what can I do to protect myself?
"
388,388,I (23F) encountered a lady with road rage and she physically slapped me and I have it on camera. Please I really need help.,"My question is how would the process be if I did press charges on her?

(I'm going to do my best to explain it visually, so please picture it to the best of your ability.)

I was leaving my neighborhood and stopped (at the stop sign) while waiting for these two people on bicycles to pass through. There was a car incoming on the left side of me, I can't tell the distance, and there was a car turning right on the other side of the road. I was heading left and the car in front of me was turning right, but they didn't do so. I made the left turn and all of a sudden a car comes behind me over powers me (this was a one lane road but big enough to have two cars) then she break checks me HARD. I started cussing and flipping out and my immediate reaction is to record.

We then hit another intersection, I'm turning right and she's turning left. She rolls her windows down, and we start cussing at each other, but once she rolls her windows down I said I was sorry but she didn't have to break check me so hard putting both of us and her passenger in danger. She got out of her car, and I could tell she was shaking so my other immediate reaction was to calm her down, I felt bad I have NO idea why. In the video you could see me reaching out my hand to calm her down and I also put my phone down because I felt it was making her more aggravated. So when I put my phone down I had slightly touched her hand and she hits my arm. Then I reach for my phone and you could see AND hear her slap me. Then her passenger gets out of the car and grabs her. My immediate reaction was to get her name, they refused to do that.

She turned to where she needed to go so I decided to follow her because she just had assaulted me and I wanted to understand why. In the second video you could see her leaning in my car, leaning in the window. She was yelling making false accusations that I was hitting her when I clearly didn't. So I told her I wasn't going to press charges and she said ""I know you aint"". I kept asking her passenger to calm her down and he said he was but he wasn't whatsoever. He told me to leave but I was getting so mad. I decided to follow her more and also called the cops once we stopped for the third time. While on the phone with the cops she got to her house, came out of the car and said ""are you happy now you know where I live"". While I was on the phone with the cops her passenger was standing outside my car smoking.

\*prior to this I was on my way to drop off some food to my boyfriend who has covid and we planned to meet half way so he knew where I was because the neighborhood also happens to be where my mom lives\*

When my boyfriend arrives the cops came shortly after. The officer asked me to explain and asked me what I wanted to do, and I asked him how the process would be and he said I'd have to go to court. I don't want to go through all that mess so I asked him he could just make sure she learns a lesson and not do it to anyone else. While the cops were talking to her my boyfriend was recording their talks and she started lying to the cops saying I called her a ""black bitch"" ( I addressed them as African Americans to the cop but I also know what's going on with police brutality that I told the cops that they have no firearms and the passenger didn't do anything out of violence and I didn't want to play race in this situation, but clearly she did.) She also kept saying I hit her when in the videos of us interacting you couldn't hear anything. She said that I ran a stop sign as well. She even admitted to hitting me but she said ""I didn't hit her hard because I knew she was a little girl"" (I am 4'11 & asian).

After the cops talked to her the officer came up to me and I felt like he was gaslighting me saying I should've just left in the begging and I have no business following people to their homes because I don't know what could happen to me. That it was all blown out of proportion and that at the end of the day nobody got hurt because nobody got shot. The whole time he was saying that I kept telling him I understood, but at the same time she slapped me. I'm stuck between wanting to move on but at the same time I am so paranoid she will press charges against me with false accusations.

&#x200B;

Please, I don't have any lawyers, I also don't have the money to even hire one. I just want my justice and to feel at peace. I don't want her driving on the road and I don't want to think every car is going to get pissed off at me just because I made a decision to turn left when it was safe to do so. I wasn't driving bad either. It escalated so bad.

I was told if I wanted to press charges I have to go to the police station but he didn't say a specific one. He also didn't make me write a report and also didn't give me papers to sign, just a card and that's it. Also the police station is closed on the weekends so I'll have to wait until Monday to get it handled.

Anything helps, just prayers or positive energy, I hate feeling uneasy but I can't stop thinking about it.

390,390,Is this April fool's prank legal?,"Edit: I got it. Bad idea don't do it. Thanks



I've been trying to come up with a harmless prank for April fool's. One idea I had was that if you take a sheet of plastic wrap like what you would wrap food with and place it against a car it will stick to the side with static electricity. It won't damage the car and can easily be removed with just your hands; it's basically a large static sticker.

If you first paint one side of the plastic and then stuck it to a car it will look like the vehicle was tagged, but won't cause any actual damage. If you went around town and stuck the ""stickers"" to random cars that were parked in public streets would you be breaking any laws?

In Washington state if it matters."

393,393,HIPPA violation?,"USA, AZ
Recently I lived at an expensive residential rehabilitation center for young adults with drug addictions. We had weekly visits with our assigned therapists and after one of these visits, while waiting for an escort back to the house, I overheard my therapist call the director of the program and share with him verbatim what I had told her in my therapy session. I know for a fact that my therapist was considered a member of ""medical staff"" and the director is not a member of medical staff, so by their own rules they should not be sharing intimate details of my therapy session. 

So, after this happens I start talking about HIPPA, asking if what just happened was legal. Two days later my therapist was fired and on the same day I was kicked out of the rehabilitation program and dropped off at a homeless shelter. 

What can I do? Is there any legal recourse? I think they threw me out on the street thinking that would make the problem go away. Please advise!"

395,395,Having a service dog in a no pets apartment,"Background: I live in Cincinnati, Ohio and attend the University here. I recently moved into an apartment where I took over a lease. The previous tenant owned a dog for a semester and never had any problems. I also know of at least 5 other tenants who also own dogs against the lease agreement. My case is a bit different though.

Current situation: I received an email from the apartment company stating that they were informed I own a dog and it must be removed immediately or I would be asked to evacuate. I did some research of the Fair Housing Act and that states that if the dog provides emotional support and alleviates a symptom of a mental condition the dog can not be refused. I am diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and ADHD. I am currently prescribed two different medications. I adopted this dog as a therapy dog and she has greatly improved my quality of life.

They have some money saved but couldn't qualify for a loan because they didnt have an income at the time during the pandemic. I was  fortunate have my 40hr/week and also I was living debt free, my mortgage was paid in full about 6 months prior. They asked relatives from her family side but all said no. With all the uncertainty going on at the time, nobody took risks on them. Except me. My brother's credit was horrible so he couldn't cosign. Now with just her name and mine on the loan, we got a 30 year loan at a fix rate. 
I don't live there and I didn't put any money down or make any payments. When they approached me around 2.5 years ago asking for help, I should have gotten it all down in writing what's their intention because nobody can predict 2 year let alone 30 years how it will be. They told me they are starting the process of removing my name off of the title/loan and once it's ready will I sign it? My response was I will think about it. 
What do I get out of it if I sign it now? The difference in the value divided by 2? Can I stall for 30 years? And what if they miss making payments? Can I force my way to make payments on my behalf because then that would mean I'm contributing to the mortgage yes?

I'm in Nevada where both parties have to consent to being recorded during a phone call.  The phone isn't lit up during the video she recorded so you can't tell she's talking to me but you can hear my voice.

I told GF that the husband told me he would sue her if she sent the video to him and that made her even more pissed off cause she didn't believe me.  Best friend was the one who said she would sue her though. 

I threatened to call the cops if she sends it to him.  Can I sue her or put her in jail if she sends the video of the phone call or the sexy photos or even the screenshotted text messages?  Can my best friend sue her? "

Yes, this sounds ridiculous to me as marijuana does not turn your tounge green neither will u have a burn unless you swallow the blunt. I told them that i hadnt smoked for a week and they called bullshit. they said my eyes looked stoned(i have natural dark circles around my eyes ALL THE TIME thats just the way i look) . he did not give me any sobriety test. sent me straight to the hospital for a blood test.   i fully cooperated acted politely and told them where the weed was, i didnt tell a single lie.  now to the police report...

Officer blank pulled Me over going 77 in a 55 work zone. approaching the vehicle i could smell the odor of marijuana.  Suspect appeared to have bloodshot eyes and was talking in a slow slurred manor. when he exited the vehicle he stumbled upon himself heading towards the rear of the vehicle(right here, he never said this to me in person neither is it true, my eyes were in fact not bloodshot, i did not speak in any disabled manor nor stumbled or anything close. )

in the report it also said i admited to smoking before driving which is 100&#37; false i said these exact words to him . ""i do smoke, but the last time i smoked was over a week ago. I am 100&#37; sober. "" again i want to state that it was a normal day of driving, over a week after i had smoke anything or drank anything. i was in my right mind i expected the officer to smell the weed whenever i was being pulled over , i expected to get possesion charge, but i did not expect to get a dui, i also looked up the punishment for first offence marijuana dui is minimum of 72hours jail time, minimum license suspension for 18 MONTHS!!

There is a civil case that I have been called to testify in. I will not state the details but I am one of if not the key witness in this case. I was thee proceeding, during, and following the actions taken. The offending party most defiantly did what he is being accused of, the only problem is that the evidence so far has been hearsay at best and by my calculations I am the tipping point for this case. Because of this, I feel that I deserve a fair sum of money. If won, this case would pay out a large sum of money to the individual who initiated it. Much more than I plan to make in the next 20 years. Because of this and my importance to the case, I deserve a cut. Nothing unreasonable but I place my value at around 5% of the total payout. I have an email ready with these demands and my value to the case written up and will be sending it tonight. My plan is if they refuse I will simply state I do not recall to every question asked of me, losing her and her lawyer the case. My main question is how should I go about receiving fair compensation?

407,407,Got bit by a rat and admitted to hospital a day later. I can literally watch the infection spread and I have received nothing but questionable and atrocious service. The streaking has now reached my chest and I have not been given IV antibiotics for several hours.,"UPDATE:

I have been discharged. I'll be attending daily outpatient appointments for IV antibiotics. 

 Forgot to mention that Rat Bite Fever is in consideration with the specialist, and was my suspicion from the start, hence my panic. However, we are waiting for infection site to drain on its own to take a culture. I have developed a rash. Yes, I was warned that Doxy might affect my mental state, which also contributed to my panic. I was switched to something called Unicen (spelling?).

While I appreciate those of you who have given me solid advice and suggested that I simply need to calm down, I am feeling pretty bitter over how my post has been placed on bestof and how the rest of Reddit is calling me various things such as a drama queen and crazy, and whatever else concerning my dose of, ""speed,"" (adderall IR 20mg 3x/daily). 

I have PTSD and receive special accomodations for it. My anxiety levels were through the roof, and it didn't help that my bf and family were in an equal panic. My mom had probably called my nurse on the hour every hour the whole time I was there. My intention in posting here was not to find out if I could sue anybody, as the bestof post implies in its title, and as others rail on me for. I wanted to inquire as to whether or not i really was receiving standard treatment, or if my family was right in being upset and pushing me to complain. All of this is obvious as per my comments. I have been nothing but appreciative and respectful to everyone who I responded to. 

For those of you calling me dramatic; of course I was being dramatic. I was scared and confused, with PTSD triggers hitting me from all directions. To the self-proclaimed medical professionals of Reddit who did nothing but get together and slander me on a thread: you are the reason those with mental illness do not trust medical professionals and seek help. Your insensitivity is what we see online and expect in the real world. All we do is wonder what others think of us, or if we ARE crazy, or what we are doing wrong. I can't convince you to change your opinions and attitude, and believe me, I understand why some of you feel the way that you do, but I can ask that you voice those things in a considerate manner. You should already know this. 


Location is NY

I was bitten, actually more like scraped by the teeth of, a friends pet rat on my right pointer finger. The following day (December 7th) I went to work as normal and had no notable issues. The night of the 7th I awoke to pins and needles in my hand, bad joint and muscle pain, and swelling in the finger. The morning of the 8th I had to call out of work and arrived at the hospital around noon with streaking up my hand from the site of the bite. They took one look and said I needed IV antibiotics and sent me to Fast Track. There, they gave me an oral dose of Doxy and explained that there was no research to support that one IV dose of Doxy was any more effective. They outlined the streaking and sent me home with a prescription; told me to monitor the streaking and that the Doxy should stop it, and to come back if it spread.

I took a nap at home and awoke to the streaking having spread to my elbow. I went back to the hospital And explained my situation. They sent me to a room in the ER where they drew blood and put me on an IV antibiotic. This was around 9 or 10 pm. 

I'll try to have some brevity with this while being concise as possible:

They explain that I will be admitted. In a span of about 6 hours I had met, only once per person, about 6 NPs who I had to re-explain my situation to every time, while also getting vitals and a physical every time. I understand shift changes but this seemed excessive. 

Once I was asked about  my psych medication, I felt I was being sort of profiled, for lack of a better word. One NP asked my list of daily meds (adderall 3x a day, trileptil 2x a day, welbutrin 2x a day, flovent, albuterol) and when adderall was mentioned (20 mg) they asked me twice to verify the dose. They then left and 2 more different NPs entered the room 20 minutes later. Same round of questioning only this time they had a printed list in front of them sent by my psychiatrist and told me they had it afterwards. They left, and about an hour later another NP came in to tell me my new room was being prepared. She read off my list of meds to verify and then questioned me about my items. I had a jacket, wallet, t-shirt, and a backpack my boyfriend brought. He was out smoking a cigarette when she started questioning me about his backpack. There was a slight communication issue because of her accent but she kept repeating to me that I was responsible for the backpack. I asked her if they planned to search it or something, to which I also mentioned they would need my BF permission. She said no, but then kept repeating that she would have to list the backpack with the other items. I asked why that is a problem and she sighed and just wrote it down with a huff. 

This same nurse came back 20 minutes later to take vitals with that band that wraps around your arm and the thing they clip on your finger. This had to be really late in the night at this point. She set up antibiotic and saline iv as well and explained that my room was ready.  Then, without a word, she left the room with all of the equipment hooked up to me, and every 5 minutes it would tighten again which was rather annoying. Also my hand with the IV was freezing cold and the arm was throbbing with pain. Another individual came in about 30 to 45 minutes later, took one look at the IV bag and exclaimed, ""whoa that is going way too fast!"" The bag was already empty. He unplugged the equipment and left. 

It wasn't until maybe 3 am that I was rolled to the new room. I did not receive iv antibiotics again until maybe 8 this morning. In that 5 hours the streaking has spread and spidered up my arm to my chest. 

When I took the first pill yesterday morning I was told the spreading would stop. Today they are trying to comfort me in saying the antibiotics take more than a day to work and that's why it's still spreading. 

They never offered me breakfast even though the cafeteria worker had done her rounds and I had to ask three times for my scheduled psych meds, which I received 2 hours late and was suffering severe anxiety and agitation. 

The streaking is still spreading, the swelling increased, my finger is purple, I have pins and needles, joint pain, dull pain in chest. I keep telling them im concerned every time they come in and all they could tell me was they may give me a rabies shot, that they reported the bite to the health department, that the specialist from infectious disease won't arrive until later today. They did not take a culture. They placed me in a room with another patient knowing I may have an infectious disease. I have not had another IV since 8 and it's almost noon. My doses have been very inconsistent. There is only one nurse pressing for a specialist on my behalf and sees the infection may need drained. I have begun sweating. Dull ache in chest. Feel hot to touch but my hands are cold. It's exhausting to stand.

My bf is freaking the fuck out that they are not seeming to take this seriously. Says I have rights and wants me to speak to supervisor or legal rep. Do I even have a case? I feel like I'm on limited time and no one here cares."

Basically someone did that to my friend and they are being a dick about it saying its not illegal.

409,409,Police entrapment on Grindr for marijuana charge,"So, I got detained by the police for possession of marijuana. The police offered to drop the charges if I Made a deal with them. Which I took as ratting out one of the guys whom I bought it from. They let me go home, but when I went on Grindr; like tindr, but for gays, this guy I knew was clearly working with the police (I just knew); to try to get me to incriminate myself. Could I refuse any deal and argue effectively that the police where trying to incriminate me? The dude lives 18 miles from me, but he was the closest person in the screen. Next closest person was 300 feet. He doesn’t know where I live now. Should I still take whatever deal they offer?"
410,410,Hey reddit I’m scared and I need your help,"So the other day I was an idiot and sent $100 to another country for stupid reasons. Now I’m getting calls and text from a guy saying that if I don’t pay $460 or something like that he’s gonna contact my family and fine someone who can. Apparently his account got frozen because the money I sent went from US dollars to foreign currency but here’s the kicker, I did cash pick up and there’s no way for that to go into an account according to the company I used. What do I do?"
411,411,Company is changing how they do payroll. Can I make them do it another way?,"For like 11 years they payed cash. I've been here about 8 months or something. I see it as a perk of the job. 

They gave us a week's notice before changing over to a proprietary debit-like card that charges you to get cash. to me that's wagetheft with more steps. 

They also let us do direct deposit into a normal bank account, but they only gave us a week's notice and I'd basically have to take off work to make an account, and they don't let you ask off less than a week in advance. 

I'm probably more pissed off than I should be about this, but I just know my company is getting a money saving deal because they're exposing us to a 3 dollar fine every-time we want to get cash out of our shitty card. 

and if it matters, my job deals primarily with cash so it's not like they're saving a trip to the bank by doing this. So it's pretty much just an excuse to charge me to pick up my paycheck. 

can I do anything about this?

412,412,HELP NEEDED URGENTLY,"So I have a question, I was  accepted into a college at the beginning of this semester as a transfer student from another 4 year university. My grades weren’t the best leaving my first college so for the second one I buffed my official transcript to look more desirable to the school by photo editing. I spent like 4 or 5 days on it and you couldn’t tell the difference unless you were really looking for something specific. I was accepted and thought that everything was great, but we were registering for classes next semester and I have a hold on my account. I read deeper to see that the Admissions office is requesting another Official college transcript. I’m freaking out because I don’t know if I’m fucked and going to get expelled from the university for falsified transcripts or if they contacted my previous university and got my old grades that way, but I heard I can be taken to court for fraudulent acts against the school. Is there anything I can do to stay in this university?? Any help would be great I have to meet with the admissions department tomorrow afternoon."

I live in Michigan near the Metro Detroit area.

If I'm in a traffic stop or if I'm involved in a situation wear the police wants to talk to me, what can I do to legally protect myself without being a dick and attracting aggressive behavior. 

**EDIT:** Some of you seem to be giving me general advice and not *legal* advice. I'm already calm cool and collected when I talk to cops. I'm looking for advice on what to do when the cops around me around me are doing illegal shit when interacting with me. Its seems like all I'm getting is to just take it and try to fight it in court.

416,416,My brother (20) recently got accused of 2nd degree rape that he says was consensual. (Washington State),"My brother (20) recently got accused of raping a girl (18-19) in the 2nd degree. This happened over a month ago at a weekend-long party at a local kids house, but the charges were just brought on him in the last week (the police came and arrested him on the July 5th). My brother swears it was consensual, and I believe him. He's made some bad decisions in the past, but he would never do anything like this to hurt another person. According to him, this girl was running around the party topless and grabbing guys' junk while asking for sex. Later that night, my brother claims they had consensual sex. He also says that other people at the party can confirm her behavior on that night. Also, she allegedly had sex with one or more people the night prior. 

Fast forward a couple weeks and she is regretting what happened and decided to press charges. To my knowledge, my brother is the only one with charges being brought against him. 

Also worth noting, when my brother was 17, he landed himself a felony drug charge so I'm not sure how that will affect the case.

I have a couple questions about this case:
1. What is the best way to go about a case like this? (I'm sure there is no easy answer, I just know almost nothing when it comes to things like this.)
2. How do cases like this usually turn out?
3. How can we prove that she is lying other than just my brother's word vs her's?

I'm doing my best to help my mom with this situation, but being down in California for work has limited my ability to help, so any advice you guys can provide would mean a ton to me. My brother's court hearing is set for July 18th, so I will keep you updated."
417,417,Electric fence near my backyard,"Location: Carmel, Indiana

I live in a suburb that has grown significantly over the past 20-30 years. Most of the area is developed, but there are still some areas that have been farms for decades and still are. One farm is right behind my house. There is a \~6 foot tall chain link fence dividing the property lines. This farm recently got some cows, and they put in what appears to be an electric fence to keep the cows in.

My concern is that the electric fence wire is \~18 inches from the chain link fence, so my kids (ages  from 1-8) could reach across and touch the electric fence wire. From what I've read, this is at least potentially dangerous, depending on the type of electric fence it is.

I'm thinking of going and knocking on their door to get more information about the fence or ask them to move it, but I wanted to know what my options are first. Is it legal to have an electric fence close enough to my property that my kids could touch? Is there maybe some code requiring a certain setback or something? Calling code enforcement and asking them is an option, but I don't want to start off by kicking that potential hornets' nest without more information."
418,418,So I got arrested today,"I was on break at work. Chilling in the parking garage with my car on to run the ac. Eating a salad at the time. I see a cop car pull into the third floor, which I was on, and she rolled around 2-3 times, passing me each time before coming to a stop. I get out and ask her if I should leave. She approaches my car and tells me she smells weed.

She immediately arrests me and searches my car. No rights given to me. Also told me that I could contact my job but failed to let me do so, meaning that I was arrested and jailed and not even allowed to tell my job I wouldn’t be back from break (for the record I’m out on bail and went and closed the store afterwards, lmao). I now have a possession and paraphernalia charge for a couple of pipes and about .5g of bud. 

Does it matter at all that she searched my car and arrested me without reading my rights, or is that totally moot? Just curious.

I have no priors besides a trespassing charge for which I was given a Michigan HYTA plea, last year. Im a college student starting school in a few weeks so I’m assuming I will probably be given probation for the charges so long as I cooperate and take a plea from the prosecutor

I’m still very bothered by my own arrest though, I was approached for very little reason and I felt completely and utterly violated as I was simply sitting in my car eating my dinner. "
419,419,Should I [24M] send a letter to my pregnant Ex-GF [F21] ?," 

Hi Everyone,

I'm in a difficult situation and I'm looking for advice on how to handle. I will go into detail, so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom

Jan 2021: I work in a midsize office building and started talking with one of the receptionists. We eventually started hanging out and had a strong connection early on. TBH, I had recently gotten out of a long term (5 years) relationship. It was a bad break up.

Anyways, we've been talking for several weeks. She comes over to my house often. One night, she says she wants to have a baby. I told her this was crazy, but deep down I kinda liked the idea. I mean, that means we're gonna be together forever, right?

Late Jan 2021: She won't let up about the baby. I told her that we needed to be together for longer before doing that. She even put in her Calendar to remind us in Aug.

Valentines Day: I caved. We were making love and she held me with her legs, I came inside. She was very excited, I was very nervous...

We keep this a secrete for several weeks until she tests positive for being pregnant. She then tells her mom (She still lives with her mom). Her mom is disappointed at first, but quickly comes around to being a grandmother. I don't want to brag here, but I am very good with parents; she really liked me. I would joke that mom likes me more than GF did.

Cut to the thick of this pregnancy. She's sick - Really, really sick. She has Hyperemesis and cannot eat or drink for days at a time. We're in and out of emergency rooms, she's constantly throwing up. I can tell this is taking a toll on her. When she was with me, I took great care of her. She never needed to lift a finger when she was feeling bad at my house. However, she mostly wanted to stay at her house with her mom. I can understand this - She's constantly puking and probably embarrassed.

During these weeks/months, we saw less and less of each other. I spent this time building out a nursery. She designed it and it came out beautiful - Pintrest worthy lol. However, We would argue over text, and we just started growing distant. I never stopped trying, but it felt like she lost interest. About 6 months in, she wants to take a break. I give her a week and then try to reach out, we break up. At first she was talking about Co parenting, we both were on the same page about making sure the child came first. Then....

After she and her stepdad came to my house to get her stuff, and stuff we had bought for the baby, she unfriended me from facebook, and then the rest of her family blocked me entirely. My number is also blocked.

The baby is due in November. I've tried to send her a friend request, but she deleted the request. I want to know how the pregnancy is going. What do I do? My friend said to mail a letter, simply wishing her well and asking how the pregnancy is going.

I realize now that being with her was a mistake. Getting her pregnant was a mistake. It was a major redflag that she almost immediately wanted to have a baby. Maybe its not mine?

I mentioned that we worked at the same company, this is no longer the case. I left the job a few weeks after we broke up, so I don't see her in person anymore. She lives 10 mins away. It's been about 6 weeks since the break up.

Please if you have any questions, I'll give addition details in comments. I am so lost on what I need to do. I don't have much of a family to go to for advice.

TLDR: New GF wanted a baby, I put one in her (I know it was a mistake), she grew distant during her sickest weeks and I couldn't save it. It's now been 6 weeks since I've heard anything from anyone. I've been blocked on my phone and unfrinded on FB. Should I try to reach out by mail?

I also want to point out that I likely cannot afford much of a lawyer for this right now. Bottom line, I'm not trying to get this girl back. But I don't want her to use my lack of communication (Remember I am blocked) against me in the event of a child support case. Also, I hate saying this, but what's the best thing for me to do financially? Try to take on as much custody, or as little custody?

We are in Tennessee."
420,420,Spouse Videotaped Our Arguments to Use During Divorce Proceedings (PA),"My husband would like to “destroy me in court” as he puts it and has been recording our arguments to prove his case that I’m crazy. It was a very emotional time so taken out of context, it could appear that I was unstable. When in actuality it was me expressing my pain. Are these videos admissible in court? Should I expect a reasonable amount of privacy in my own home and not legally allowed to be recorded? Should I be worried about this?"
421,421,Can I be sued for exposing a racist business owner?,"TL;DR local small business owner is super racist and horrible on his personal Facebook and twitter and I want to expose him but don’t want to get sued. 

Hi all, I’m from a small town and there’s a local favorite sno cone place that everyone loves. I’ve personally known the owner (he franchised it and is the only one that works there) which when I was younger I thought practically gave me celebrity status but now has put me in the position I’m in. For years on his personal Facebook and twitter he has been making awful racist/xenophobic/homophobic/you name it posts. I’ve brought it up to people I know personally before but now more than ever it’s been weighing on me to make a public Facebook posts with screenshots I have compiled of his posts over the last 4 years. I hate seeing my friends who are active and vocal for BLM, gay rights, etc still going there, I know I would want to know if I was supporting someone who thinks like he does. 

My question is can he take any legal action against me for doing this? I simply want to post his own posts he has made on Facebook and Twitter, unedited of course, and just say do what you want with this info but I had to make it known because I know most customers dont know him personally so they don’t have him on Facebook to see for themselves. No call to action to burn his business down or anything of course. 

Thanks"
422,422,Car rental company gave away our car without notifying me.,"So me (19) and my GF (18) are on holiday in Sweden. Our plan was to rent a car and drive around the country for a bit. We reserved a car with a rental company, let's call them RC. All our overnight stays have been paid for in full and the rental car has also been pain for.

I just arrived at the airport to find out RC has given our car away to someone else, without notifying me first. RC has no other cars available for us to rent either, and without a rental car we cannot finish the rest of our holiday, consodering the fact that we need to drive a few long distances. 

It turns out the reservation for the car was made for the 20th of August, but today is the 21st. Appearently RC stated us as a no-show and gave the car to somebody else. However, when I look into the rental policy there is no talk of RC giving your car away to someone else. RC only has a no-show policy where you have to pay them a certain amount of money as a reimbursement for RC not being able to rent out your car. RC did however rent out my rental car, so it seems illogical for me to pay this reimbursement fee. 

On another note, I traveled all the way to the airport out of the city, which cost me even more money, does RC have to cover this cost for me or not? Considering they had me travel to the airport without notifying me there was no car there. 

All of this is Swedish law, I suppose.
Any advice at all is very welcome.

EDIT:
We went to another one of RC's locations and they gave us a free upgrade to a higher end car, so at least we can finish our holiday.

Thanks to everybody that did not understand my question properly and immediately thought I am an entitled prick. I am not, I was just asking if I would be able to get all my money back, considering I could really use it. My English just isn't perfect so I might've worded some things poorly. One guy even used this post to bash on Americans and timezones, when neither of them is even mentioned in this post."
423,423,Road Rage in [CO]," 

Okay, I did something where I know I was totally in the wrong and I wasn't behaving as well as I should've. Let's just get that out there. Onto the situation:

Today I was driving in Colorado and a car with a young woman (mid-20s) tried to cut me off. Having none of it, I accelerated to prevent her from doing so (it was the best way to avoid an accident, she seriously had NO ROOM to get in). Naturally, she got furious and started doing everything she could to pull alongside me. She was flipping me off, screaming and swearing at me out her window, and doing all the usual things. Normally, I wouldn't engage, but today I wasn't in the best mood. Thinking stupidly, I did the thing that I thought would piss her off the most. Instead of your usual middle finger or something like that, I did the ""eating out"" hand/tongue symbol, where you make a ""V"" with your fingers and put your tongue in it. I was upset and knew that would piss her off WAY more than if I just flipped her off in return. Not surprisingly, I was right. She went berserk.

She immediately whipped out the camera phone, and stopped her car in front of me to start getting video of me and my license plate. Then, I saw her on the phone (I'm assuming with the police). Normally, I wouldn't be too worried about this because I'm 99% confident I didn't break any laws. From what I've been able to find, the Supreme Court has ruled that giving the finger is protected by freedom of speech, but this wasn't exactly the middle finger.

Full disclosure, I am on probation for something completely unrelated.  My biggest concern is that because I'm on probation, this will be made into a much bigger deal if she pulls the sexual harassment card.

As far as I know, she has no concrete evidence that I even made that gesture, but you can never be too sure these days. Short of the gesture, I didn't engage her in any other way. I stayed in my lane, went the speed limit, and went off on my way home. She didn't follow me, I made sure to check.

Does she have any legal recourse? Would cops actually show up at my door and try to arrest me for this? Did I break any laws? 

To anyone who is going to send me hate mail, let me just say I know what I did was wrong, and I don't feel good about it. Sometimes I have a tendency to ""hit where it hurts"" when I'm upset, and that's what I did here. It was a stupid mistake and the fear I'm in right now has ensured I'll never do anything like this again."
424,424,[UPDATE#2] My neighbor is getting beat badly.,"I'm back. And to be honest I wish I never asked for advice here. Things have gotten really bad since I followed the advice and guilt tripping that I received. I'll try to keep it as short as possible, but it's pretty lengthy and complicated. Here we go.

Lots of shit went down on Friday night. We're gonna call asshole upstairs Kris and his wife Kelly and her sister Rachel for sake of the story. Kelly went and picked up Rachel to stay for the weekend with them. Which I thought was odd since he was supposed to move out Saturday (of course I knew he wouldn't, but still). They've been having loud sex the past few days, which they always do in between fights. (sigh) Anyway. Rachel comes over. Kelly asks me if I can follow her to take Kris' truck to the garage and drop it off so the garage can work on it Saturday. So I did. Left my husband at home with my two girls and her one girl. Her two boys rode with her. Rachel stays home alone with Kris. Bad idea.

So we're on our way home (dealership is an hour drive away) and he's blowing up Kelly's phone. He's drunk. Got into the liquor she had hidden from him. He's saying she needs to be home in 30 seconds or he's going to pound her face in. She tells me to keep going past the house and don't stop. I'm thinking she's finally going to go. I was very wrong.

We get to the next town and we stop at the gas station so I can go to the restroom. I come out and she's on the phone with him again. He's arguing with Rachel. I don't know all the details of it but he says he told her something she didn't want to hear and tried to call 911 and he took her phone. She's saying how ditsy she is and I'm telling her that Rachel wouldn't want to call 911 unless she thought she had to. I said he may have beaten or raped her. (Kris mentioned how hot Rachel was previously, I just had a suspicion) She said no, he wouldn't do that. Okay.

Well they're on the phone and he's drunk as hell and she hears him say, ""I'm feeling really lightheaded"" and the line goes dead. So she's freaking out that he passed out or died or something. So I call my husband to go check on him. (cause let's be honest, regardless of his trashiness and how horrible he is I can't in good conscience allow someone to die if I could help). Husband finds him the shop, not breathing. Husband gives Kris chest compressions and calls a bus. He started breathing again before they arrive and they take him to the hospital. (he has liver issues [surprising, huh?] and heart problems)

We go back to the house so she can get some things and her daughter and go to the shelter. As soon as we get there I go upstairs looking for Rachel. She's nowhere to be found. I'm freaking out. She doesn't live near us (actually, in another state, about 2 hours drive) and knows nobody in the area. We looked under beds and in closets and everything and she's gone. What the fuck did that bastard do to her?! At this point husband says he heard a girl upstairs say no no no don't touch me.

So I call 911 myself. Tell them about Kris and that I can't find Rachel. They put me on a three way call with the state police. I'm telling them about Kris beating Kelly and the operator interrupts me and says let's focus on the raped girl first. (as I referred to her as such as I said it's a possibility based on what husband heard). Cop says, ""Oh her? She called us and we're in route to her now. She's safe. We know where she is."" I felt relief and dread at the same time. He referred to her the same way I did. He confirmed it. They said they're going to talk to her then be over to us. She ended up at neighbor's house down the road. They took her via ambulance to the hospital to get tests run.

While all that's going on, Kris calls Kelly. Of course she answers the phone. Says he's done at the hospital and needs a ride. She asks to borrow my car to go get him. I said no. He can find his own way home. He calls my phone. I answer and put him on speaker. He tells me, ""You better find me a way home or when I get there you're not going to like me."" Husband flips. I flip. I'm like now you're threatening ME? I have to wait on the cops for the girl you fucking raped. Husband jumps in and says something to the effect of ""how dare you threaten my wife."" Kris says, ""Shut the fuck up old man or when I get back we'll see how much of a man you really are.""

I hang up. Kelly is saying she isn't going to talk to the cops. She's scared of his sister and Kris hurting her dad and mom and shit. I knew it. I FUCKING KNEW IT. She isn't gonna say shit. The second the cops come she hauls ass up the stairs. Leaves her kids down there with me. (wtf, they're all awake) Then proceeds to constantly text me telling me she wants her kids. I didn't say a word to the kids about going up.

Cops talk to me. I show him the video and pictures of her beating and bruises. Tell them what little I know about the Rachel incident. They want to talk to her. I text her and tell her to come down and talk to them. She says no. Cops says she needs to come down and collect her children and answer questions about what she knows about Rachel and if she doesn't come down, they're coming up.

She comes down and she's evasive thru the whole thing. Half answers and shit. Says, ""Rachel mentioned she didn't have her phone."" I butted in and said, ""No, you told me he said he took her phone because she tried to call 911."" *gives me death glare* Cops looks at her and tells her he knows what happened and to quit playing games with him. He said he didn't need her information and he already has a laundry list of charges on Kris. She still remains tight lipped.

Other cop takes her into the shop and talks to her about the beatings. She denies everything. Won't say a word about it or speak against him. So when she goes up I ask what options I have. He said none really. I'm shocked. I say wtf? I have video evidence of this stuff happening. He's threatened myself and my husband. He's pointed guns and bow and arrow and my husband. I have two small children in the house. He said, and I quote, ""well, we can't do anything about something he MAY OR MAY NOT DO IN THE FUTURE. And after checking the charges we have against him as of now, they're all misdemeanors and I can't arrest him unless Rachel's blood tests come back that he drugged her."" (Note: she's saying he ""felt her up"" [cops phrasing, not mine] and not raping her. Which apparently is the difference between a felony and misdemeanor in this case) So they can't go arrest him for anything. They can't arrest him when he gets back and he was currently looking for a way back. I asked what about the kids? He said they'll have to open and investigation about it. They can't just take them.

So I'm dumbfounded at this point. He's fuming at us, on his way back, and threatening to do god knows what to us and the cops won't do fucking shit. They recommended me moving or getting them evicted. WTF. Seriously, WTF!? So exactly what I've said multiple times in the other posts happened. The cops didn't do shit, he knows I called them, and I'm fucked. No good deed, for sure. Cop says I need to call when I'm hearing the beating or when I'm getting threatened and they'll come back out. (let it be noted it took them an hour to get there as it was) I said I may as well call you and the coroner and when you both get here we'll see which is needed. (And seriously, he threatens me again and I call, then what? You fucking bastards didn't do a damn thing to help us the first time, what makes me think you will the second?)

So we left as soon as the cops did. Packed only what we needed, very quickly, and fled to my mothers house. We passed a taxi not 3 miles from our house. (we don't have taxis around here. It was him. We left with minutes to spare) Still here now. Luckily, my mother owns the building and is giving them an eviction notice tomorrow. Not sure if it will stand up in court (I have no fucking faith in the justice system or police at this point anymore), but she's going to try. Until then my life and my children's are completely turned upside down and THAT STUPID BITCH STILL DIDN'T LEAVE HIM! My kids will be missing the rest of the school year and I'm sending them to their dad's house to be even safer for them for a while. My dad is serving the papers Monday so we're going to stay here as long as necessary I suppose. Which may be for fucking ever as of course he knows where I live and the cops aren't going to do shit if he threatens us again.

So my life is fucked as well as my kids'. The kids of Kelly and Kris' are still seeing everything and suffering. She's still suffering. And now I'm living in even more fear. 

Fuck me, right?

Edit: I do have a question. Why can someone threaten you multiple times with a deadly weapon, and you have evidence of them doing so, and nothing be done about it? Why is that not a serious thing?
"
425,425,"Can I get a restraining order based on this? If not, what are my options?","I am in SC.

Ok. Here is the situation. Quick background. Ex wife is living with her girlfriend in a lesbian relationship. I divorced her based on a provable affair she had with this woman. Both women are, without being officially diagnosed, clearly Borderline Personality Disorder. I was always a little concerned for my safety since this whole thing started but it was just a concern and nothing material I could present to the courts to get any kind of restraining order. I got primary custody of my kids. I have always felt they are working one on child at a time to alienate them from me to have them ""want"" to live with them. They do get visitation. My 3 kids are teens 16, 15 & 13. They have successfully converted the 16 year old against me and he is horribly abusive to me. Hates me with a passion for no reason. I am a good person, a gentle soul, and a  ""textbook"" model father. I am well educated and a white collar business person. It's a clear case of parental alienation at work by both the mother and the girlfriend.

The girlfriend is telling the kids that she is their new step parent and all other kinds of manipulative stuff. She is proven to have a temper and I would say is unpredictable. Let's call her ROSA. Her ex husband had a domestic violence charge against her that was eventually thrown out by the court.

Now here is my question.... 

There was a heated three way conversation yesterday with my son, his mother (my ex wife) and me. A car pulled up to the driveway so I paused looked out the window and said, I wonder who that is? My 16 year old says with the calmest tone and without any hint of it in any way being intended humor.... ""I think it's the hit man that Rosa hired"".

Now the point is, whether that was said in jest or not, it is pretty evident in my opinion that that has been discussed. Something like that does not come out of the blue out of the mouth of a 16 year old unless it was thought or discussed. I genuinely fear for my safety. Do I have enough here to take this to a judge and get a restraining order against Rosa both against me and a restraining order against the two crazies and keep my children away from them toxic ways?

I have it recorded. I recorded the entire 2 hour conversation. Throughout the recording you can also hear the hatred for me by my son that has been built up in him against me. Speaking to me very abusively and throwing F words around left and right.

In that recording I also have my ex wife admitting that Rosa has a temper and I also have a previous recording of Rosa verbally exploding at me another time where I saw rage in her eyes that almost erupted. 

What can I do with what I have? (Mainly based on yesterdays recording) I need my kids way from these crazies and I also genuinely fear for MY safety. You hear stories every day of ex husbands being knocked off, either by the ex wife, their lovers or even kids whose minds have been poisoned. I might be one of those stories if I don't act.

I am in SC."
426,426,Friend accidentally poisoned someone,"My friend (who lives in Florida) was fired from their job, and believed it was unjust because of a co-worker trying to get them fired.

The attempts to get my friend (Fr from here on out) was approached on the floor of business that had customers and coworkers by the owner of this particular business (franchisee). Owner told Fr that Fr couldn't do anything about being fired, Fr can't defend herself or do anything to keep Fr's job. Fr felt attacked/humiliated in public.

Fr saw some hand sanitizer and put two squirts in owner's water while she was away with the intent to make her taste something terrible. Realizing this was out of character and a result of being humiliated and overly emotional, Fr tried to pour all of it out of the cup, but the owner started coming back so Fr put owner's cup back on the counter before the owner saw that Fr had been holding it.

Owner takes one sip, asks out loud if someone put hand sanitizer in the drink, Fr and another employee laugh (the employee tried to hide their laughter, Fr didn't because they had already been fired and hadn't realized that isopropyl alcohol is the active ingredient and didn't realize how harmful it is to ingest).

Fr told me casually in a text what had happened, and I immediately realized that it was not just a simple prank and could seriously hurt someone. I spoke with Fr and told them that the cops might get involved if the owner presses charges, and under no circumstances to talk to them about this particular thing without legal counsel first because it is not as harmless as Fr thought.

Fr had no idea that the way hand sanitizer cleans is by using a chemical that is dangerous to ingest. Fr thought it was just like soap, and was the first thing in sight that was available to make the owner feel uncomfortable and taste something bad, and told me after the fact that if something like cayenne pepper or salt was readily available and in sight that Fr would have put that in her drink.

There was no intent to do actual harm, it was in Fr's mind just a petty thing to make owner taste something gross. This whole event was captured by CCTV. Police called her asking for a statement regarding a call to corporate about being unjustly fired, but luckily I was able to talk to Fr first as I said before, so Fr didn't meet with the authorities (Fr was not home either way). Investigator said they'd leave something at Fr's door for a statement regarding a vague investigation, but there was nothing there hours after the fact. I'm pretty sure they want to take Fr into custody because owner pressed charges. Maybe I'm being paranoid?

How bad is this situation for Fr, worst case scenario? I have a passing interest in law, but never went to school or anything for it. They have no way to prove intent if there was no previous incidents of threatening or malice, right? Florida states tampering with a drink can be a first degree felony with intent to kill or harm, but am I right in thinking that the prosecutor would have to prove intent/motive for that to stick?

428,428,My 17 year old niece was arrested after a traffic stop and her rights have been violated every step of the way,Our family needs help. My niece was in a car accident where the other driver died. My niece was not conscious and the sheriff searched her phone without her consent. The sheriff says the phone was in her hand and not locked so him seeing the text message she was typing was okay. The sheriff arrested her at the hospital and handcuffed her to the hospital bed and they took her to jail instead of letting her recover there. She wasn't a threat to run away but they still cuffed her and put armed guards on her. They did not allow her parents to be present when she was questioned by then even though she is underage! They also went online and looked at her Facebook page because one of the text messages she sent mentioned a selfie she just took. Her bail was set so high that it impossible for us to pay it even though she has never been arrested before and has no criminal record. She is still sore from the accident but the jail won't give her a soft bed to rest on like she needs while she recovers. It seems the sheriff wants to throw the book at her even though she is just a kid. Our family is from Virginia but this happened in Illinois when they were on a trip but they won't send her back to a jail here so she can be close to her family and her parents can't afford to stay there forever. We want to get a civil rights lawyer to get her to get released and make this to end but we don't know where to start.
429,429,Piece of Sports Memorabilia Contains Athlete's Personal Information,"I have in my possession an internal police printout from an arrest of a famous athlete. It includes personal details of the athlete along with the athletes front and side view photos from the arrest.

Nothing on it is anything outside of public knowledge except it has the athletes Social Security Number.

I am looking to get the autograph authenticated and potentially look at selling this piece of memorabilia but the inclusion of the SSN has me wanting to know the precedent.

Should I black out all or part of the SSN? 

Am I in the wrong possessing this ""as is"" or would I be in the wrong trying to sell it ""as is""? 

If the athlete were to pass away would that make a difference?

430,430,Soon to be ex-wife insists we're going to be splitting ALL assets - including my bitcoin,"[Ohio] My wife and I have been together for 9 years, married for 5. We have a 5 year old daughter together. I invested in bitcoin fairly early and made a fair amount of money from it. My wife always hated me throwing money away on it and tried to encourage me to stop - it lead to a lot of arguments and became a contentious part of my marriage (albeit one of many). 

Throughout our marriage I had a much higher wage than she did. we bought a house together (that I put up the majority of the cash for) a few months prior to getting married and had a shared bank account that she completely cleaned out (taking roughly $12,000) right before she decided it was over. Throughout our marriage I contributed about 75%+ of my wage to our home and family life, and used the additional 25% mostly on my own investments. She contributed to a few bills her and there but given her meagre salary she was mostly able to keep her own money for luxury spending. 

Since splitting my ex has been having some sort of breakdown and sending me endless text messages and harassing me over the phone about how horrible a person I am/ how badly I messed up her life and how she knows I'm trying to ""f**k her over and hide all my assets in that bitcoin shit"". I browse this sub enough to know one thing -  I've saved a copy of all the text messages and recorded some of the phone calls (not sure if this is legal, or of any use in a courtroom) in case it comes in handy later.

When I spoke to my lawyer about the divorce originally I didn't mention much about my investments in crypto-currency (we still haven't had a proper face-to-face yet) but it seems ex wife mentioned it to her lawyer and he's confident they can at least get a settlement for half of the perceived worth of my bitcoin. This could be my ex making stuff up or misinterpreting him though.

What makes the problem worse is my wife has no idea how my investments are doing, or even a basic understanding about bitcoin. If I had to total up my personal savings, investments in crypto-currencies and 'traditional' investments I'd say they currently sit in the $120,000 range but she's convinced herself I've always been lying about the value of what I have. She's insisting I have $600,000+ hidden and seems determined to get it. I'm worried she's also going to try to paint me as a bad guy trying to selfishly hide personal wealth so he doesn't have to support his own daughter.

Have there been any divorce cases where assets were held in crypto-currency? Is a Judge likely to award her half of the perceived value of my bitcoin? It seems a little unfair to have to split it when it I had to make the investment while listening to her nag me not to, and after she selfishly cashed out our shared savings. I'm VERY worried people might buy her sob story about the horrible ex-husband hiding his assets in this new technology and believe her dumb claims about the value - especially if they're a technologically challenged as she is. Am I likely to get in trouble for this?"
431,431,Teacher Engaged in Long-Running Conspiracy to Sabotage My Future and I Have Documented Evidence. Can I sue?[TX],"The title might seem slightly hyperbolic but I assure you that everything I'm going to tell you is real and is fully correct. I've been in the same school over the past 4 years and during the course of the studies one teacher has made it their mission to sabotage me via poor teaching, selective enforcement, biased rounding, slanderous comment and false political allegations

The teacher is an enemy of my parents because of some business dispute long-ago so he has decided to enact revenge on me. It began by making minor errors in the marking of my tests often just enough to bump grade down a letter which I just assumed was because he was lazy/tired but after consulting with my peers I realized that the only person that had been sloppily marked had been me. He refused to make any changed claiming that the grades had already been set in stone

I came back to school the next year and all my other instructors were treating me differently inquiring I realized that the teacher had claimed that my parents had spent thousands of dollars on tutors but neglected to mention that the same was true for most of my peers as well. The teacher had all taught that most of my good-grades and high-quality work came from the tutors instead of my own talent and hard work which denied many Extracurricular acitivties which are necessary for college application.

He just so happened to neglect to add me to an email informing everybody of change in school citation/plagiarism policy which forced me to re-write a month long project in weak causing my grades to plummet. Actions such as these have continued causing my true potential to be wasted and for my college application to have a distorted picture of me 

I have documented evidence for all the above incidents, and since I've been unable to gain admission anywhere except for a state university. I'm angry and ready to sue, DO I have a case? "
432,432,[NC] Employee transitioning from Male to Female - Sales are falling,"I run a retail store in North Carolina that targets a fairly conservative, traditional customer base. Two years ago, we hired a new male employee that was responsible for customer service, including answering customer questions, working the register, providing refunds/exchanges, etc. Six months ago, this employee started coming into work wearing mascara and press on nails. I called him into the office to talk about this and he mentioned that he had decided to transition from a man to a woman and was hoping that it wouldn't affect his employment. I told him that I respected his decision, but that I would appreciate if he kept the more flamboyant parts of his transition outside of the store. The pattern since then is that he is continuously becoming more and more flamboyant. Every time, I remind him of our conversation and he tones it back for a couple of weeks before ramping it up again. Today, he came in with a wig, full makeup, press on nails, earrings, the whole bit. If it weren't for our uniform, I'm sure he would've worn a dress with heels.

This has not affected his work performance. He's still doing his job. He arrives on time, is helpful to customers, and accurate with the register, but the sales in the store are down over 10&#37; compared to last year. I have had a few customers comment on his appearance and my response is usually a joking brush-off about it being 2018 or that if Bruce Jenner can do it, why shouldn't this guy. But in 15 years of being open, we've never had a down year, much less one so drastic like this one. The only thing I can think of is that we're losing customers due to this employee. Even though customers won't overtly complain about it, I believe they're taking the business elsewhere to not have to face this employee.

My legal question is: How do I deal with this employee that is affecting the sales of my business without bringing on a discrimination lawsuit or potential bad press regarding being discriminatory? I'm honestly thinking of suspending him today, but have no work-related cause other than he basically came to work dressed like a woman. What are my options r/legaladvice?"
433,433,"Help. My son is being accused of sexual assault, including drugging his ""victim.""","Crosspost from r/legal

Edit: Oregon

I'm an older redditor, but I've been around here for over five years and I know how amazing this community can be when the rubber meets the road.

I just found out about this situation today; this is a dumpster fire of brobdingnagian proportions, and I'm casting about for input. For obvious reasons, I can't share a lot of details because I'm trying to support my son without muddying the waters of emmerdement in which he has suddenly found himself swimming.

This young man is a STEM-field phD candidate at a large university in his mid-30s. He met a girl at a bar, drinks were had, one thing led to another, and sex took place. According to my boy - and I believe him, because I raised him and I know his heart - it was 100% consensual and he made sure of that before proceeding.¹ The encounter took place in the middle of last year, but six months later the woman filed a complaint with the university that she was drugged and raped, and has found himself in the middle of the bureaucratic horror that is a University's disciplinary system. His career, which he has expended immense effort to launch - largely by dint of pulling himself up by his bootstraps and a lot of hard work - is in jeopardy. In this age of #MeToo - which is, by the way, a critical and timely and important movement - this is the worst possible social time for a young man to have to deal with this kind of accusation, especially at Universities which are more interested in preserving their reputations and their funding than in pursuing justice.

He has a university-appointed attorney/counselor, and while she's helping him put together his defense, she's basically defeatist and telling him ""You're going to be expelled, just prepare for it."" He's a broke doctoral candidate, I'm a retired man of very limited means, and I'm untutored in the byzantine labyrinth we call the law. I'm also thousands of miles away from my son, so it's rough.

Clearly he needs a competent criminal defense attorney that is not connected to the university, but how to do that without going into the poorhouse is beyond me. What I'm hoping for is input, as Johnny Five says, ""megabytes of input. Anything at all would be appreciated

**Additional note**: I've been through the wiki here; sheesh, the law is complex. I have read the section on incapacitation and consent, but I don't know really how that works when two people get silly at a bar and sex is had. If only the victim is drunk and assaulted against her will, that's clearly one thing. But if both are potted and consent was clearly asked for and given, how does that rise to the level of assault?

¹ Just living in the world and following the news for over 65 years is enough to convince me that most parents are all, ""Oh, my kid is a good kid, he/she would never do something like that."" But guess what, they would, and they did. No, parents don't know everything about their kids - but I will pin my own reputation to that of my son, and if he goes down, I'm going down with him."
434,434,I (19M) am planning to report myself to my college for the sexual assault of a (ex)close friend (18F). What should I be prepared for.,"This happened in Michigan. This has all been so sudden and scary. I never thought I would be this person. After coming back from a party a week ago she and I engaged in sexual activity. I'm not sure how much detail I should go into so I'll just summarize. 

After returning from a party she and I were both fairly intoxicated. At this point I was aware that she was significantly more intoxicated than I was and that her judgement was impaired.

Maybe 1-2 hours later we were in private. She told me that she was beginning to sober up. She initiated contact by moving my hand onto her breasts. I asked for and recieved consent twice. No clothing was ever removed and I only used my hands (I'm sorry if I'm using weird language I really dont know how to talk about this comfortably). This went on for a while until she abruptly got up and left.

The next morning a recieved a text telling me that I comitted sexual assault, and that she did not plan on reporting me to the college or the police as long as I never tried to contact her. I have not attempted to contact her.

I feel extreme guilt. This person was a close friend and I can't live peacefully knowing I hurt anyone this badly let alone somebody this important to me. I believed everything was consensual. Im not sure if I had reason to know if she was mentally incapable to consent given the circurmstances. I feel that the right thing to do is to report myself to my college to at least open am investigation. If I comitted assault I don't want to run away from it. 

What should I be prepared to face, and what should I do before I report the incident? What should I do in general?"

She tested positive in November and had mild symptoms over the next few weeks. About a month later she developed a blood clot in her leg, which the virus is known to cause. She was treated for the blood clot at a hospital and released back to the nursing home. We were led to believe she was stable, however she suddenly passed away a few days later.

My dad got her death certificate in the mail and we were surprised to see that COVID-19 wasn't listed as a primary or secondary cause of death, and neither is the blood clot. The primary cause listed was a respiratory infection. 

How do we dispute this? Would a lawyer be the only way, or do we start with the nursing home or the hospital or the county or a state representative or...? To make things worse, we all live in Pennsylvania, so we would be doing this from afar. 

I'm wondering if the coroner labeled her death as such so that the nursing home wouldn't have to have this count towards their number of COVID-19 deaths.  From what I read in the news, I'm guessing a lot of COVID victims are never officially identified."

I see one chicken to my left, my baby girl Big Red (RUSS/RED), I see to my right my Denver John. (Speckle BLK/WHT). I tell the mutt to GTFO (PETE!, GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY YARD!!!) I started video recording with one hand and my dog (Big Louie) chased him around. I was furious beyond words. After the mutt gets back to it's own house, I walked to my back yard to complete silence. Wait, whats good with the chickens! My vision blurred and the world slowed down like the south park ""Imagination Land"" When the breach happened and time slowed after Stan got hit...

440,440,New Jersey-I lied about my kid's rabbit being vaccinated and it bit my neighbor's daughter.,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I know this was a stupid move on my part but I never thought it would escalate to something like this. A month ago I bought a rabbit off Craigslist for my daughter. I wasn't provided any papers on it being vaccinated. I know, dumb. Last week my daughter's four year old friend was over the house playing with the rabbit and it bit her. Her mother was understanding at first and asked if the rabbit was vaccinated. I said it was and thought nothing of it. 
Well two days ago we found the rabbit dead in its cage. My daughter told her friend who told her mother. Apparently the mother called her pediatrician and the doctor asked her to get proof the rabbit was vaccinated. Well, obviously I can't provide that. 
Now the kid may have to get a rabies test or shot which is apparently like 30 shots in the stomach. Her father came over the house the house tonight and threatened to beat me up if his daughter had to get the shots. I frankly felt threatened.

Neighbors called the cops, two showed up, the latter shot my dad shortly after arriving on scene, on our driveway.

In court, the cop's justification was that because my dad was Asian, he was acting in a threatening martial arts manner.  He'd never taken martial arts, he worked at a software company as an engineer.  This marked nearly the 10th racially-motivated police shooting in 2 years in that county.  There were several investigations but all concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the cop for wrongdoing (surprise!).  So my mom lost the $50million federal suit and had to settle for $1 million, most of which was gone after lawyer fees and moving expenses.

My mom received a pittance for my dad's death after the lawyers had their cut.  They tried, but either weren't good enough or the 90s legal system was too fucking corrupt, and I wasn't old enough to become an activist and social media hadn't been invented.  The settlement hasn't been enough to put all of us kids through college, I chose not to go so my little brothers could.  It's fucking with my head and my future.  Is there anything I can do to open this matter back up?  If anyone has any advice on how I can go about investigating this, or details I'd have to dig up beyond antiquated articles, please let me know.

(edit: clarity)

edit 2: I'd appreciate any alternate perspectives regarding statute of limitations and possibility of maneuvering outside of the decisions binding my mom, since I was a minor then and had no comprehension of anything up until relatively recently.

edit 3: Anyone know any software-entrepreneur-therapists? /s"
442,442,Ventura County Red Light Camera Ticket... Can you simply toss it in the trash?,"I live in Ventura, CA and I have recently received a red light camera ticket with a blurry unrecognizable image of myself. I know that it's me but nobody else would be able to determine that without reasonable doubt. After speaking with a Ventura County CHP I was told that if I didn't respond, the courts would end up giving up because I never agreed to appearing in court by not signing the ticket. I have now gotten a second notice from the courts saying that I've failed to appear for my trial, my fines have increased, and they will be contacting the DMV to suspend my licence. Can they do that even though they don't have any proof that I've received their notices? Please Help!!! I DO NOT want to mess with my credit and or my driving privileges.

443,443,[UPDATE] Ex GF has belongings and refuses to give them back. Can I get a LEO involved?,"Update to my last post. First of all, I want to thank everyone to chimed in with their advice. I did end up having to get the law involved and though she did end up giving the firearm back once she realized they were coming, she still refused to give back my belongings. She states that she will give back the belongings (~$1200 worth) once I get her name off my vehicle... which she is a cosigner. The LEO played along and told me that im getting the better end of the deal, 20k to 1200... and I was like, wtf? Since the firearm was returned, it turned into a civil matter and nothing the LEO could do but to mediate. Anyway, I have everything documented and a case number so I can take her to small claims court and file for replevin. With that and the case number, I can claim that I attempted to get her to return my belongings and she refused. 

TL;DR: Called the police, firearm returned before they arrived. Still no belongings so filing for replevin."
444,444,I was assaulted on the operating table - Legal action yes or no?,"I live in Australia and want to see your thoughts on my potential claim for medical negligence/malpractice.

I gave birth to my Son in January of 2019 via csection. After receiving my epidural and while having my catheter inserted I started to feel sick and while my partner entered the operating theatre I begain to panic asking if they could please sit me up (the worst panic attack I have ever experienced) The anaesthetist told me to 'snap out of it' and grabbed at my cheeks and slapped me in the face until I was sedated seconds later. My partner was immediately removed from the theatre. I woke up in a state of panic. I came from a DV relationship prior to meeting my partner and father of my children and this took me back to that time. I never saw the anaesthetist again nor got an apology for her physically grabbing my face (I guess assaulting me) while I was unable to move. 

Months later I ended up with a mental health team and a perinatal psychiatrist and has diagnosed and medicated me for a variety of mental health issues including complrs PTSD which is likely to be life long. 

I had my third child 16mths laters and ended up with the head anaesthetist with me throughout the birth along with my Aboriginal health care worker and partner. I reluctantly went to my pre-anesthetics appts with alot of anxiety and hatred for the surgical team at the hospital and trying to refuse another csection. I told her what happened and she told me to 'do what I have to do' when I threatened bluffed legal action. 

I guess what im trying to say is, would I have a case for medical malpractice? Is it worth it? I just want to move on and forget it ever happened but yet every now again again I have flashbacks and it makes me feel so helpless. I cant even recall the week following the birth of my son. Its like that time has disappeared. It terrifies me to even seek care at hospital thinking I will be treated the same if I panic for a procedure. I dont feel like myself anymore and I feel sad my vibrant outgoing personality is gone...."
445,445,Food poisoning ended up giving me a hole in my esophagus,"So I’ve had food poisoning from Taco Bell three separate times. You’d think I’d learned from my second time, but when you haven’t eaten in twelve hours  and that’s all that’s around, had to eat it. 
Fast forward to the next morning: 4am violent vomiting and non stop diarrhea until 8:30am. Used google to Check symptoms and sure enough, what I had read told me to go to the ER. 
I get to the ER they do blood work and hook me up to an IV for water. Results came back as a high white cell count.
With this new info, I have to go and do a cat scan and they end up finding tears in my esophagus. 
I’ve been in the hospital now for three days, possibly another three, and transferred to the proper surgeon I would need. 
My insurance just ran out as I turned 26 in June. 
I am from California, but this happened to me in Las Vegas Nevada.

What I’m trying to get at is if i could sue Taco Bell. The doctors diagnosed me with food poisoning but then the extra exams found the tears. These tears would not have existed if I hadn’t been poisoned

What are my chances with a case against a chain food restaurant like Taco Bell?   
so this most recent instance happened in Nevada,  would I have to file in Nevada as well? "
446,446,Use of the N-word by white vs black employees.,"Texas

I am a white guy working at a restaurant where work environment is pretty irreverent. Drug use, sexual themes, underage drinking, etc are all frequent topics, as is the common use of the N-word, especially among kitchen staff. In a debate with a coworker today regarding the use of the word as an epithet vs a term of endearment. I posited that either the word was offensive and no one should use it, or it was a term of endearment and anyone could use it. My point was that a different standard should not be applied based on race. She, a black woman, said that she was allowed to use it but I was not. I said, ""I have the right to say anything that you do. Nigga. There, I just said it"". The coworker complained, and I was sent home. I am facing possible termination over this, despite the words frequent usage among black and Hispanic staff members. I would like to know if this constitutes discrimination, as a different standard applies to employees of different races. It was obviously poor judgement, and I have literally never said it before, but she got under my skin. Ironic how quickly a hypothetical debate became a reality.


Also, I know Texas is an at-will employment state, however I have a right to arbitration through the company per my employee handbook. Company based in Colorado/Tennessee, if that matters.

Thanks for your time, sorry if this is a stupid question. "
447,447,"(Ohio)is it illegal for my ""boyfriend"" to force religion on me?","Hey everyone, 

So I'm new here and could use some advice. 
 Basically my boyfriend is controlling in general, but when it comes to religion, he is extremely controlling. 

I'm a Christian, and he is Jewish. He hasn't converted yet, but lives and poses as a Jew. We have alot of the same beliefs due to attending the same church for some time. We have Known each other for 8 years. Been together pretty much that whole time. 

Within these past 6 months I've struggled terribly was depression and I've changed a lot, some of which is for the better. My views on religion and practices have changed a bit as well. He's never heard me out on this, and has shut down every conversation in relation to it, and refuses to discuss it. 

So I'm curious, is there any laws in regards to forcing religion on a spouse? or boyfriend/ girlfriend? 

By forcing me, I mean if I don't do exactly what he wants, he starts calling me a bitch, amongst other things. He doesn't see it as, me making my own decisions, he sees it as me being ""difficult."" I'm pretty sure, I have the right to make my own decisions.  He gets visibly angry and agitated, and will talk non-stop about the situation. 

Thank you. 


Edit: Wanted to let you all know that I left him. Life is so much better. I'm dealing with depression and fear but I'm free and so greatful to be out of that toxicity. I seriously could not see how bad it was, I'm happy to be free."

-Say something on the podcast to get sued 
-Get sued by a big name company
-Get into news headlines
-Get listens on our podcast because of the publicity

450,450,Fired from job for being angry. Co-worker touched me sexually,"So I'd like to get some advice on what has happened to me today and a few weeks ago.

&#x200B;

Today I got fired for my job for threatening a co-worker. I told him I was going to kick his ass. I was mostly joking. However a few weeks ago he sucked on his finger and got it wet with saliva and poked my butthole with his finger intentionally. I made it clear to him that I did not like being touched and if he did again I was going to kick his ass. I don't encounter this co-worker every day. However a few times afterwards he continued to make threatening motions to try and touch me over and over again. Each time I shoved him away and stupidly threatened to kick his ass. I did not hit him though. Only enough to back off and get away from him.

&#x200B;

So now I have no job. I would like to know what I should do about this. Should I contact the police and press sexual assault charges? I didn't get a chance to tell my employer my side of the story I was forced out.

If anyone has any advice on what the best thing I could do is, I would really appreciate it."
451,451,Did the cops illegally detain me and were they negligent while doing so?,"Colorado laws shall apply here. 3 cops showed up on my door issuing me a harassment ticket. They were asking for my information in order to fill out the ticket. They asked for my phone number and I simply said ""I don't need to provide you with this information. It's public info I'm sure you can find but I'm not going to provide it."" 

They immediately put me in cuffs and walked me to the car.  They did ask if anything was in my pockets before placing me in the car which I know is correct, but once I was in the car I was able to take the hand cuffs off with ease. I tapped on the window and kept asking the officer stupid questions. Just mainly to get his attention to the fact that I wasn't hand cuffed. 

After they ran my information and were about to uncuff me I made sure my hands were in front of me and I said "" you didn't do well I took the cuffs off.""

""We weren't worried about you"" was their response 

I feel like this was negligence on Their part and they weren't following standard protocol, nor do I believe I should have even been detained for not providing my phone number. 

Was I in the wrong? Were they in the wrong? Can I possibly get my whole charge thrown out because of their negligence?"
452,452,Detained at a Texas Walmart for shoplifting while going to grab a cart without ever leaving the store.,"So this happened yesterday morning on my day off when my sister (28F) and I (20F) went to our nearby Walmart in San Antonio for a short shopping trip. We had brought with us those tote bags for shopping because we did not want all of the plastic ones at checkout. She brought a Walmart one, and I brought one from sprouts. We continue throughout the store, stopping at various places of interest where we deliberate over products before putting them in our tote bags. 
When we finally decide to grab the groceries, we realize we had run out of space in our bags and needed a cart to carry the milk. I volunteer to grab the cart and realize on my way there that Walmart is separating the exits and entrances due to COVID so I decide to leave on the exit side, get into that middle section with the carts (before you go outside), grab a cart, and continue back into the store. 
This was my plan however security didn't see it that way and stopped me right as I passed the sensor (which would have alerted me of what I was doing anyway). I did not get close to the sliding entrance doors as the sensors are several feet before them.  The first thing I tried to explain to the head of security was that I just went to get a cart, but she insisted that I had to go with her into the side room. Once there she instructed me to take the items out of my bag and when I asked if I was being detained she said yes. I continued to explain myself and tried to get her to realize this was just a misunderstanding as I had only gone to go grab a cart but she was convinced that once I passed the 'last point of sale' that I was shoplifting. All the while, my sister is frantic looking everywhere for me in the store as I failed to return with the cart.
The security lady kept me in there for 2 hours roughly, going over the footage of me (she showed me the video) and asking me questions. She showed me how she had been watching me and my sister since we came into the store. As we watch, I point out that there is no attempt to hide or conceal any of the products as I just put them in my shopping bag but she had stopped listening to me at this point. She even admitted to questioning her decision when she called her ""big boss"" (her words) for his input on the situation. After talking with him outside they decided to go through with the charge and SAPD shows up, the officer cuffs me and tells me to show up to court in a month. 
The total amount 'stolen' as recorded on my citation was $31.03 and was a spring mix of spinach, a white bandana for my hair, and some crocheting items my sister had picked up. I complied with security, all Walmart representatives, and the police, and though I got emotional when I was handcuffed I was in no way aggressive. IMO, the security lady seriously jumped the gun on detaining me and having me arrested when there was a reasonable explanation for this. Is this as ridiculous as I think it is?? I've never been in trouble with the law, I'm just a student and I'm really scared."
453,453,How can it be legal for a hotel or youth hostel to deny a minor accommodation if that minor has no other place to go?,"Hello and sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post to but I'm very lost and clueless in this. I am an Australian of 17 years of age that is moving to France for university. Uni starts in September so I have a lot of time to kill and travel. I am currently in France. However almost all establishments I go to (including youth hostels and Airbnb) refuse me accommodation. Yesterday I had to sleep in a bloody forest because of this and will do this tonight as well. How can it be legal for them to do this? How is this not considered child endangerment or something of the sort? I usually lie about my age to avoid this which works when the establishment isn't ""fancy"" and doesn't bother with my age. I get that the laws regarding this exist in order to protect the hotel/youth hostel from issues regarding liability and whatever but by refusing me they are putting me in danger. Also once again sorry but I have no idea where to ask for help but here. Also I'm not looking for help I'm actually pretty happy sleeping in the forest aside from the cunt load of bugs and future accommodation will not be as hard as this, I just had a lot of problems happen over the last few days.

455,455,A neighbor left my daughters unsupervised for three hours. Can I press criminal charges or file a civil suit against them?,"My wife had an agreement with a neighbor down the street that they would alternate days picking up both family's kids from school.  Today was the neighbor's day to pick up.   My wife was three hours away on business and I was out of town.  My wife received a phone call from my daughters saying that no one was there to get them.  My wife called the neighbor and asked where she was.  Neighbor says her son didn't go to school today so she didn't have to pick up our daughters.  My wife explains she is three hours away and needs her to go get them.  The lady says her son has a baseball game that she can't miss.  My wife was unable to find someone else to help, so drove back to get the kids.  They were alone outside the school for three hours.  My wife told the woman she was irresponsible and she blew her off and told my wife she was overreacting.  Seeing as there are common human trafficking kidnappings of preteen girls in the area (Columbus, Georgia), both my wife and I did not think so.

Is what the neighbor did illegal?  We had an agreement, and evidence of the agreement is present in my wife's text messages.  Can I press criminal charges or file a criminal suit?

458,458,[Cali] I'm thinking about buying and eating industrial Lithium Carbonate. Is that legal?,"I have bipolar disorder and it is being [treated with Lithium Carbonate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))
[Lithium Carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_carbonate) is also used in industry for things like ceramics and lithium-ion batteries. Pure Lithium reacts readily with many chemicals, including with those in the atmosphere. Because of this, Lithium is frequently sold and shipped as the stable Lithium Carbonate after being mined. 
The point is that industrial Lithium Carbonate is readily available at many legit chemical distributors. The purity of the Lithium Carbonate that is sold varies but it is easy to find Lithium Carbonate that is much more [pure than pharmaceutical grade Lithium Carbonate.](http://www.risonchem.com/product_detail/id/207.html)

If I buy industrial Lithium Carbonate in bulk then I can measure it myself and save thousands of $$$$ by cutting out the middle men (like the pharmacist). In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for Li-ion batteries is causing the price of Lithium Carbonate to increase year by year so buying industrial Lithium Carbonate in bulk now would allow me to lock in a price.

Giving out these self made capsules would be clearly illegal and I have NO intention of doing this. This Lithium Carbonate would be for my own consumption *only*. I have not tried ordering it but if while ordering it I'm asked why I want it then of course, I would not tell them that I plan on eating it (would this cause me any legal trouble?).

So is it legal for me to buy and eat industrial Lithium Carbonate? Or would it then suddenly magically turn into a medication and somehow violate the law?

Edit: Got my answer. It's not illegal. Thanks everyone."

460,460,Stopped by plough drivers at Pike's Peak for reckless driving. Park Rangers said I am going to receive a summons for reckless driving.,"On Saturday I was driving at Pike's Peak, when two men operating a plough told me that my driving was unsafe and that I should leave. I had not done anything to warrant this, though my car is loud and does ""look"" quick. 

They had stopped to watch me round a corner, probably as I had my girlfriend film my car while I did so, (Pike's peak is on my bucket list and I wanted a video of me in my car there). I did not see any problem with what I was doing and drove around the corner as normal.

They drove up to my girlfriend immediately afterward and said ""you're not safe, you're leaving"". I thought this was in reference to the filming, and we obliged and made to leave the park.

When I got to the bottom of the tolled road, I was stopped by park rangers who requested my license and told me that I would be issued with a summons for reckless driving. I did not believe I had done anything wrong, and handed over my license as requested.

Upon researching this, it appears to be quite a serious offense that could result in jail time, and I believe this would almost certainly impact my visa. (Irish citizen working under an O-1A).

It is my belief that I did not act recklessly or even carelessly, and that no proof exists or could exist of this other than the two witnesses in the plough, and a park ranger who claims to have witnessed me ""peel out"" from a stop sign near the top of the peak. (Worth noting that my car is incapable of ""peeling out,"" as claimed).

What should I do here? Given the potential severity of the situation I feel getting a lawyer is prudent, but at the same time I was not stopped by an officer, nor was I doing anything wrong. 

If anyone has any direction here, it would be much appreciated."

464,464,I repeated office gossip in a goodbye email to my coworkers.,"This last week I left a manager job that I'd had for about 18 months at a small retail business. I wasn't fired, I got a new job and put in my two weeks notice. My boss wasn't the greatest. She was angry a lot, and easily frustrated when training new employees. She was always gossiping about them to me, and some of the stuff she said about them was pretty nasty. For instance, she said that one employee was too fat to wear leggings to work, and that another employee was wearing tops that were too low cut and that her chest looked gross. Then the business got a weird review online, and the boss thinks that one of the employees wrote it. She told me this!

So after I left my last day at work, I sent some emails to the other girls telling them what the boss had said about them, and yes, some of the things they said about each other. I know that repeating office gossip is a little dirty, but it felt really good to vent and get it all out. Well they all told the boss! 

So the boss called me and left a voicemail telling me how disappointed I was, and that I shouldn't use her as a reference anymore because I betrayed my post as manager or something, and that if I continued to email the other employees about the business she would get her lawyer involved. She sued a former employee once before, I don't know for what, but she pretty much ruined that persons life. 

Can I actually get in legal trouble for this?
Can she rescind the really good reference she gave me for the new job I just got? Can she call them up and take it back?

You guys are dicks. I was just trying to be an honest person and to warn my coworkers about what a poisonous person our boss was. Now I might pay the price for doing the right thing and trying to help others.

467,467,"Seeking advice, before I lawyer up, on what to do about being put on child support.","Location: TEXAS

Seeking legal advice...
This is my throwaway account. My main is my username for everything, so I don’t want it being linked back to me, and would like it very much if a face couldn’t be put to the stuff I’m about to type.

The mother of my child wants to put me on child support. The case is still pending.
I don’t want to be put on child support.
I want my daughter to live with us equally (alternating four days of the week every other week), and the cost be cut in half. I don’t want to help the mother with her rent or anything. I just want to make sure my daughter is well taken care of.
Should I get a lawyer? The lawyer I want to go with is asking for money even for advice. Would it be a waste of time and money since 90% of the time the mother always win.

Things I have on her that could help me.
-She has let my daughter get lice for months on end over the last three years. She waits until the last minute to do something about it. Always! She thinks that the over the counter stuff works, but she only buys it once they get really bad.
-She’s always sick while with her. I know little kids get sick a lot. It’s mostly always strep throat or an ear infection.
-On top of the lice thing on her hair, she developed a fungus on hair (which is now gone), but the doctor told her that it was most likely from being dirty, and not bathing. She would not bathe her because she rather her go to sleep or she’s too tired.
-She has an one bedroom apartment. I have a three bedroom house that she will have her own room in.
They share a bed over there. My daughter needs space.

Now the more complex stuff I hate talking about.
-I have videos of us fighting where she gets physical, and starts swinging at me. In the videos you can hear me asking her to stop.
-When we would fight and I would just need space away from her; she would go as far as showing up to my job. One time she showed up with our daughter unbuckled in the backseat. We had to argue outside my job, and I told her to just go home, she sped off causing my daughter to fly backwards in the back of the car. I texted her and told her that I was going to call the cops and told her what she had done because I was worried about my daughter. She texted back “It wasn’t that fast.” “She didn’t hurt herself. She’s okay.”
-I wasn’t always the best boyfriend. I let the stress of making ends meet get to me, and started neglecting her, and she ended up cheating. For two years we tried getting over it. I just couldn’t.
-I have pictures of the scratches she would leave on me after a fight we had because she was tired of me “not being able to see her” and the effort she’s putting into fixing the fact that she cheated.
-I got pictures and videos of her breaking stuff outside my house just because I wouldn’t let her inside my home for stuff that belonged to her. She also has stuff of mine that she doesn’t want to return. I’m willing to give her all her stuff back, but I need my stuff as well.
-Before the separation. We shared my current home. She would apply for store credit cards, max them out, and let the bills to collections. That just shows she’s terrible with finances. So I have a stack pile of letters from banks and debt collectors trying to collect what is due to them.
-She’s a shop lifter or was. I don’t know if she still does it, but she’s been caught three times at Walmart while being with our daughter. She’s lucky that they didn’t call CPS on her. She would text me that she was caught and she’s really nervous, and whatever one feels when they’ve been caught in deep shit. So I only have text messages of her saying she’s been caught with dates and time stamps, so perhaps I could go to that Walmart and ask for a copy of that footage from that date.
There’s more, but you guys get my point. I don’t want my daughter developing such toxic habits like her mother.
Should I go for full custody and be the one to put her on child support or should I just bite the bullet and take it up bum like most men who are put on child support?
Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks."
468,468,Parents want to kick me out without notice and are threatening to call the police and lie if I don't leave,"I'm 19. My parents want to kick me out. They haven't given me notice which I'm sure they need to give me notice before they kick me out. I told them this and they don't care. 

My mom says she will call the police if I don't leave. She will tell them that I'm using drugs. That's not true. I wasn't using any drugs until today and she found small amounts of Coke and heroin and drug paraphernalia that she says she will show the police as proof so I'll get arrested for drugs. 

I'm high right now in case that matters so if she calls the police, I'm gonna still be high. I'm not obviously high or fucked up. 

Can the police arrest me for the drugs my mom says that I did even if I'm not obviously high? And what do I do if the police show up and my mom starts lying about me saying I'm violent or stealing from the house? Would I be arrested for things she claims I'm doing because there's no proof I actually did anything she says I did. The reason I ask is because I fell and cut my head in the process and so she might say I was fighting because I look it. 

Also I have money that I made in my bank account that my parents won't hand over even though it's mine and obviously I can't complain to the police because then my mom will just say I'm lying or high and they'll believe her. 

And also, if I leave and my parents call the police anyway, would they look for me? "
469,469,I just found out that my younger sister was fucking raped by her ex along side her friends.,"I want to break this mother fuckers neck. I dont know how to press charges, nor how to prove him quilty. The only evidence that we have is texts where he s blackmailing girls to send nudes and threatening women. How should I go about this?"
470,470,"Maryland- my POS ex-girlfriend is taking advantage of the Red Flag Law, and she’s trying to claim my “alcoholism” is making me suicidal.","I’m a college aged man, and as a young and dumb adult, I merely didn’t know my limits when I had a night of drinking. I passed out and somebody called the ambulance because they thought I was showing signs of acute alcohol poisoning at a house party. The reality is that I sleep like a rock, even when I’m sober. It was just that I happened to barf because I also got dared to chug a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi, which made the vomit look concerning. 

My girlfriend hears about this, she comes home from university, about an hour away, and she immediately starts telling the doctors and nurses that she “always knew my alcoholism would make me suicidal!” 

I immediately tell her to shut her mouthy a** up, and try and explain that I simply didn’t know my limits, and there’s no evidence to suggest that I’m suicidal. Doesn’t stop her, she then starts mouthing off about how I might shoot myself out of impulse. 

I always wanted to break up with her, but didn’t have the heart to do so, but this particular day was different. See, she’s a POS because she cannot accept the fact that I don’t want to smoke weed with her. She tries to push it on me constantly, which has put a damper on our relationship. She also handles stress terribly by turning on her close friends, and she’s a thief. Additionally, we don’t see eye to eye with gun ownership. 

Anyways, she said she’s going to be seeking the protective order that takes an owner’s guns before due process. I lose my cool, and I tell she needs to get the F out of my life, and that I don’t want to ever see her again. She was taken back by those comments, and she asked if I was for real, and I said yes. 

I even brought up all the crap she’s pulled, the stealing of fundraiser money, the pressing weed on me all the time, the temper she has when she’s stressed, etc. I told her that I was done with her. She refuses to leave the hospital room. 

I tell her to get the hell out, she still doesn’t want to leave, I poured the now cold shepherd’s pie down her bra, and tell her to get the hell out of my hospital room. She runs off in tears and embarrassment. 

I check out of the hospital after spending 6 hours of my life there. We go to today, I get a knock on the door, and the police officers explain to me that the judge has indeed granted the protective order, and that I need to hand over my firearms. 

I ask for a moment to consult with my attorney, I ask for advice, he tells me to itemize all the firearms by taking pictures of everything the police grab. Building off that, I didn’t tell the police anything, and yes they missed many firearms. 

One’s cached underground, and they missed a couple hunting rifles. 

Of the things they took, it included stuff that I wasn’t aware was fair game with these horrible laws such as my compound and crossbows. My muzzleloader, hunting rifles, etc. 

I then tried reaching out to the county attorney, and she basically told me that “people’s lives are more important than your guns, and your hunting” when asked how I would defend myself without a gun, she rudely says “use a baseball bat!” And hangs up on me. 

So where do I really go from here? Do I get my attorney on this thing? 

Oh yea, I’m being charged for the pie incident, but that chick promised to drop the charges if I apologize and hook back up with her..."

472,472,Awful AirBnb Trip. Evicted out of the house with 7 kids under the age of 4 for having to many people in a hot tub and staying int he hot tub 7 minutes longer than allowed.,"The title sums it up. My family and friends were staying in State College, PA over the weekend for the Blue and White weekend. We got to the AirBnB rental property at 10pm on Friday night. We stayed the night, went to the game the next day and came home around 6pm. We then played with the kids in the back yard, ate dinner, put the kids to bed, and retired to the patio and hot tub for the night. We were drinking, a couple of us got in the hot tub, definitely too many, but not unsafe. I own a hot tub so I did not consider this misuse. Well at about 10:05 the host game out from behind some bushes and started screaming at us, telling us we were being too loud, it was past curfew, and we were miss using the hot tub. He said we had to get out of the house right away and the cops had been called. He was screaming at us to get out and actually screamed at my 3-year-old daughter. The Cops came and when they arrived, they actually said they thought they were at the wrong house because it was too quite. We explained the situation to the police and they pleaded with the guy not to kick us out. We apologized and said we would go inside and head to bed as we had seven children sleeping in the house. He would not take no for an answer and had the police forcibly remove us. He showed the cops a video a video of us from the surveillance system (is that legal to film us?). The cops said they had never seen anything like this, but they had to ask us to leave. It was very traumatizing, especially to the kids and my autistic sister (who was crying throughout the whole thing). We eventually got everyone up and out of the house, which took us until midnight, and had to drive 2 hours to one of my friend’s house to stay. We called the police this morning and the Sargent was very nice. He complimented us on how we handled the situation and even mentioned the guy tried to charge us with a noise violation and public disturbance. The Police called a district judge to see if they could do that and the judge told them, we were doing nothing wrong. This cop even apologized for having to do it, and said they would not have handled that as well as we did. He said we literally got kicked out of the house for having to many people in the hot tub, and being in the hot tub for 7 minutes to long (the police call from him came in at 10:07pm. Anyway, I reported the issue to AirBnB and I requested a full refund. This guy was a true asshole. Is there anything else legally I need to do or should do? I think this guy is dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to be on AirBnB and should have consequences for what he did. Any help would be appreciated.

EDIT: 
House Rules


No smoking


Not suitable for pets


No parties or events (this was not a party)

Residence is in a Quiet Residential Neighborhood. No parties allowed and noise ordinances 
are in affect after 7pm. (Cops said there is no noise ordinances and when the pulled up they did not hear anything. We did not recieve a noise violation even though the guy wanted us charged with it)


We apologize that our Hot Tub & Patio
area must be vacated by 10 pm. (Didn't even get the chance to because the guy scared us out)
out of respect to the neighbors. (no neighbors complained per the cop)


Video Surveillance on exterior of property.


Non-compliance with this rule will result in loss of security deposit & or Possible immediate eviction of the property.

Edit: Grammar\Spelling


Edit: To Further Paint the picture.  There was no party.  At it's peak we had 11 total people outside on the deck relaxing, 6 of those in the hot tub, and a kid sleeping.  We are all over the age of 35 except the kids.  The guy showed up at 9:57pm and called the cops at 10:07pm per the police report.   At this point there where 7 adults outside and 4 in the tub.  We were actually wrapping up before he jumped out on us as my brother and his wife had already gone inside, and another couple was already in bed.  My dad, who is 68, walked around the house to make sure we where not being to loud at 9:15pm.  I don't think we broke any rules at this point, as there was no max limit on the hottub set and he jumped out on us before we had a chance to vacate the outside.  Also, no need to send me parenting advice.  Looking for legal advice, which I did get some good responses on.  Thanks to /u/antmadison for pointing out they are not supposed to kick us out.  They are supposed to contact AirBnB to resolve the problem.  Thanks for the support and help!!

Edit:  All 11 adults where staying at the house.  The house sleeps 15 per the posting.  No one not staying at the house was ever at the house.  The kids where in Pack N' Plays and little cots.

Edit:  Everyone staying in the house was registered to stay in the house.  The owner was there when we all checked in on Friday."
473,473,UPDATE: Some guys and me in my school got in trouble for touching girls. Can we legally get in big trouble? (update),"So today was my first day back at school. We actually just finished spring break but my suspension was three days before the break started (so basically extra three days of break xD). 

Anyways the principal called my parents and I into the office. Apparently its a little worse than I thought. It wasn't just one girl that reported us. It was like 5 or 6. We aren't allowed to know the names (confidentiality and privacy duh). The principal told us what we did was very serious and that a lot of guys got in trouble for it (more than 6 actually, a lot more got in trouble, I thought it was just 6 but I think atleast 10 guys got in trouble). He told us that this behavior, if continued, would involve the police. He also told us that the girls' parents could potentially report us to the authorities.

The principal did tell us that the school did not tell the girls' parents the names of the perpetrators (again because of privacy and school policy).

My parents were pretty mad at me too. They took away a lot of my game/phone privelages and Im actually typing this from my moms laptop on incognito mode. My dad took away my allowance too and said Im not allowed to go out with my friends for a few months.

Now Im trying to figure out how to apologize to the girls. I wont do this shit ever again for sure. I didnt realize how much it could hurt people and thought we were just fooling around. On top of that, what type of brother am I being to my sister? And as the older guys in the school, what type of example are we setting? I dont want my sister to go through this in 7/8th grade. 

So anyways I plan on apologizing to all the girls in person. I thought about doing a letter but thats a written confession and not good for legal stuff. It shouldnt be too hard. Im friends with most, if not all, of them and I do talk to them quite often. Ill apologize to them and help them out if they ever need anything. Also I wont hang out with my friends who did this either. I think they are also remorseful and are facing punishments from their parents too. Im not going to blame peer pressure either, I did this, nobody forced me to do anything.

As for legal trouble, I think I will be fine. Maybe not but we'll see I guess.

thanks for the advice and lessons in my original post."
474,474,My job is retroactively firing me and withholding pay.,"I'm in Arkansas.  My job contract was through June 20 and I'm a salaried employee with biweekly pay.  I had to leave the state early May 31st to move to a new job, medical residency, that begins July 1st.  So from May 31st until now I have been out of state and not present in clinic which is 2 days a week and is my only job responsibility now.  They do not rely on me at the clinic and don't miss me while I'm gone.  In fact, no one knows when I'm supposed to be there aside from my boss.  I know I should have had a conversation with my employer but no one knew I was gone until I confessed, over phone, to my boss when she emailed asking for my keys.  I'm wondering if I'm entitled to those two weeks of pay because I was not fired before now. Can I retroactively be fired and pay withheld?  Some things to add, I had to leave on May 31st and couldn't leave later.  I regret it but I was trying to be sneaky and get paid for those extra weeks as I desperately need money and I knew no one would miss me."
475,475,"[NY] Serial rapist just got an order of protection against me for telling people he's a serial rapist. Only confirmed victim won't come forward. Order of protection says ""no third party contact."" What can I still do?","I introduced this dirtbag to two of my friends and he coerced one of them into sex multiple times, seriously traumatizing her, probably the other one as well, and who knows how many others. 

I've been spreading the word and he came to my house yesterday saying he was going to take me to court for slander. I was very excited to watch him either confess (he thinks what he did wasn't rape so he might) or perjure himself while getting increasingly frustrated that the court won't just trust his word.

I'm very disappointed he's going after me for harassment instead. The definition of harassment seems really stupid to me at this point, I don't understand how he was able to do this instead of slander. It seems like it completely changes the game, right? I know he'd fuck himself over in a slander case, but with this I'm not so sure. Am I wrong about that somehow?

First thing that's happened so far is I was just brought to the local court for an order of protection. It's just the usual, but this is the most concerning part:

>  Specify other conditions defendant must observe for the purposes of protection: NO THIRD PARTY CONTACT

The judge told me this meant I can no longer talk to people about him. I literally can't have any communication with anyone regarding him. This doesn't make sense to me, as I've had an order of protection against me before (I totally deserved that one though - mental breakdown, said some horrible shit) and from what I understand, third-party contact is just that, having a third party make contact for you. How can it prevent me from sharing information? It seems to me like the judge was just bullshitting because everyone in the justice system seems to be a pathological liar when it comes to grey areas. It probably just makes his job easier. Honestly, I don't give a fuck how easy his job is, while I'm trying to stop this kid from hurting anyone else. 

So what are my real legal limits? Can I actually still contact people and tell them what I know as long as I'm not asking them to contact him or anything? What if others contact me about him, can I answer their questions? I'm prepared to deal with whatever amount of hassle it takes. I'm not afraid of jail time while the case plays out, either. I do not give a shit what hardships I have to go through for the sake of this endeavor, as long as I can prevail in the end legally. So don't give me the advice that makes things easiest, give me the legal truth.

As an aside - this is a much more important question, but I have to relegate it to footnote status because it's so much less likely to get answered - is there any fucking way I can get him to charge me with slander? It's such bullshit that this is being done through harassment laws, it shouldn't be possible. Can I appeal to get my charge altered? Like seriously, is there any (legal) action I could take that might trigger a slander charge? Or is this going to play out differently than I thought and there's just as much room for him to fuck himself over in this case as there would be with slander? "
476,476,Impersonated on Facebook to the point of being arrested (almost Swatted) 3 times! Facebook/Police not helping and I'm scared for my life. #Swatting,"This is absolutely madness: I am in desperate need of a good advice. I am scared for my life. This is a ""throwaway"" account for obvious reasons. This is all about throwaway accounts ironically. **If your going to comment please read thoroughly and understand all the dynamics involved, not looking for hundreds of comments telling me to report the account or things like that, that won't help.** 

Last year I was dating a girl for several months, at the end we had a miscommunication about what she wanted and she became pregnant. It was one of this issues that we split up over and in the heat of moment she believed she needed a Protection From Abuse order. I allowed a default judgement to happen because I did not want to fight with her in court at all, I was too sad. There was no actual abuse ever in our relationship outside of disagreements, not verbal, physical or otherwise. She simply had raised hormones and really did not like some of my opinions on that matter but it was not abuse. I talked to people about the breakup and abortion to grieve and may have made a post about how sad I was to have an abortion.

Roughly 6 months went by and everything was fine until one day I get a call from a police officer explaining they have an arrest warrant for me for harassing my ex on Facebook before even asking me any questions, claiming they had tried to call earlier but I never received any missed calls. He tells me that the profile name is (lets say for story purposes) Jason(not my name, not even close) and that Jason has been threatening my ex. I explain to him that this is impossible because I have her blocked on my Facebook account, and agree to be cooperative and allow him to do whatever they need to prove it was not me, but that it was definitely not me. I was certain they would rescind a warrant or have to if give it a second look given new evidence proving it wasn't me. I know you usually are not supposed to answer any questions but I was and am genuinely interested in finding who really did this and in protecting anyone from this person or these types of actions by anyone to anyone.  The police's logic up to that point was absolutely unhinged so I thought any kind of logic would help.

Upon getting the police reports months later they are saying the person simply said that yes they were me when asked by my ex if it was me. They also are saying it is me because the person mentioned the pregnancy and her and I were the only ones that could possibly know about that (6 months later, after I had vented to many about it in a healthy way and after she could have told anyone) or talk the way the ""Jason"" talked to her.

I was arrested none the less, I had unsecured bail that time, but immediately I began to become completely afraid and victimized. No one had advice for me to protect myself from further arrests and that stress has not stopped to this day to the point it is getting very problematic for my mental and physical health even though the arrests have finally stopped (after a 2nd and 3rd), I'm traumatized. I am starting to see a doctor but do not have insurance so that makes this all more stressful to the point where I have really never felt lower in my life or more afraid. The stress makes it hard to mount the kind of courage I need to take this on. It's a real shame that I have a support team and am still feeling defeated. I hate to think about the weak ones in our society.

Weeks later at the arraignment I was told I was being arrested again for the very same thing, again without being talked to. Again the same profile. My worst fear that they would keep doing it had came true and no one had or has any answers to this day. Bail was secured and we decided to pay the whole thing which was thousands of dollars.

Whoever impersonated me (or still is) is definitely getting the best of me. I thank anyone who is reading because it's been hard to vent on social media due to the sensitive nature and I tend to cry very badly if I talk about the way I REALLY feel in person so this is the first time I've been able to tell a fuller side of the story to anyone outside my family and a couple close friends but even than I try be brave to not stress them even though I am terrified. I'm worried my lawyer won't have me testify and I'll be railroaded and never heard, locked up and have the key thrown away for something I didn't do and given a ""life sentence"" of harassment from this person to get me in trouble whenever they want.

I have a good lawyer and I have confidence in him but there's so much more at stake here than just my criminal defense and I saw that from the start. That's why I'm here is to find a lawyer that feels passionately or specializes in civil rights. No one should ever be arrested for such flimsy evidence, Facebook should be giving them information to actually catch the person, or someone higher up in cyber crime should be involved to do WHATEVER needed to really catch this person as red handed as possible. Bottom line is the police are not doing their job and this is a common problem between me and my ex. Facebook is not doing their job catch ""Jason"" SO FAR and it's been over 7 months or longer.

AND it didn't end there! Months later I was contacted again by the police as the impersonator was harassing her again. But this time they didn't have an arrest warrant yet and I had an air tight alibi under cameras and without my phone so they did not arrest me.

2 days later the same police department arrested me again without calling, without looking into the events 2 days prior, simply based on the links to the account based on the previous arrests. This time ""Jason"" said used an escalated threat and a new charge was added. I believe they were trying to Swat me. Bail was through the roof this time, nearly $10k cash. None of the police officers were educated in what Swatting is. I don't know who gets bailed out over and over again and pays cash bail just to do something they know they would get arrested for again, it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. Its been hell on my family. Before I left the police station I went up and asked the front desk for help as my fear was setting into full blown panic of going home just to be arrested again. They had no answers. My criminal lawyer helped the arrests stop after that but I have no idea whether or not the actual harassment has stopped other than to guess because they have not told me about arresting anyone else for it; meaning that the person is still free to do it, and I'm not sure what would make them stop.

I have tried to avoid thinking about who exactly it could be ""Jason"" so I don't go crazy but I thought about the motivations.  They either don't like me, or her, or both, and there are all sorts of people who could fit that description and also know about our situation and details about our lives in the 6 months between the break up and the incident.

I need all the help I can get. I'm scared. I want the person responsible caught and brought to justice. I wonder if the only way to do that is with a good civil rights lawyer who perhaps has dealt with a similar case, Swatting, or with Facebook I have ways to borrow money to pay whatever but it is straining me and adding to the stress and victimization. I really think that I have a strong case to win some money for having my rights violated like this. When I did a search here on Reddit I'm not the only one who has incurred loses from someone impersonating them on Facebook. I want to make sure this doesn't happen again and the person is caught but if I should be compensated I want to know if that's something that I should start now. If I should do anything to get this in the public eye and court of public opinion or anything to prevent it from happening to anyone in my state or in the country again I want to know. Any advice at all is appreciated. Not looking for information on a specific lawyer here as that's for another thread but rather if that's something people do now. Thank you for your time. It feels great to get this out and I'm sure I will have some great advice soon.  Your helping a man who feels completely broken. Your helping my ex who is a single mom with a son get justice. Your helping my family and anyone else affected. But mainly your helping everyone and that's what this thread is about, not specific advice or my defense but more so generally how this affects the legal system, everyone, me, etc.

P.S. and putting up with any grammar or rule errors as I'm stressed thinking about this and it's late. I will proof read and fix anything needed asap, please bring it to my attention if I have done something wrong here, I initially didn't realize I had to go somewhere else for specific lawyer recommendations.

Thank you all. Spread Love and Peace.

I work nights, and sleep during the day.  I ordered a pizza from a pizza place as soon as they opened at 10 AM.  The pizza was not delivered by noon, so i gave up and went to bed... Two hours later I was awoken by the police knocking on my bedroom door, inside my house.  Apparently the pizza place called the police because they ""thought something was wrong""  but i suspect that in reality they were just getting petty revenge for me not answering the door because I was asleep.  I should add that the food was paid for, as i had given them my credit card over the phone.

The police opened my (unlocked) garage door from the outside, and then opened my (unlocked) door that went into the garage, and woke me up by knocking on my bedroom door inside my house.

478,478,(Georgia) My brother was shot twice in an Uber. No health insurance.,"Hi Everyone,

I appreciate all replies in advance.  This happened over a year ago and I have yet to find any options that help the situation.  I should have posted here sooner.

My brother and his lady friend were getting in an uber behind some local bars when 4 men approached the car with guns drawn.  They were tapping on the windows and demanding the people in the car give away valuables.  The driver hit the gas and the men started shooting.  My brother jumped on the girl and took two bullets.  The uber driver drove him straight to the hospital.  

My brother didn't have health insurance. Yes, I get that probably wasn't the best decision on his part. Through all surgeries and medical complications he accumulated over $100k in medical debt.  

Uber did nothing through all of this.  They were slow to get back to him and offered very little condolence or options.  My brother has given up on his debt and it has basically tanked his future financial stability.  Luckily he is alive, healthy, and well.  

Is Uber not liable to offer some sort of recompense if a rider is hurt or attacked? If not, isn't this a bigger problem?

Edit: I get that Uber wasn't at fault.  Maybe my post was poorly worded.  I guess I should have asked how does Uber not have some sort of insurance for their riders in case something bad happens.      "

My boyfriend said she'd be super understanding because she's been in the same situation and she's had 8 kids. I know I have to provide proof of pregnancy, and I have a job, I pay bills, I go to school, my grades are decent. 
My boyfriend really wants to propose and it's all he's been talking about since we found out. I know we're young, I know I should be careful. Can anyone please explain the legal process that would have to take place?"
482,482,Citizenship Marriage,"Hi everyone! 

I was asked a few weeks ago if I’d be interested in marrying someone so they can stay in the US for 20 thousand dollars. 

The person who asked me is asking for his friend. He says he has known him for years, a great guy, and he needs to stay here so he can keep sending money back to his country for his family.

Questions

1. What are the concerns I should have if I do this, and if there are ways to prevent them, what are they?

2. Is 20k a good price for doing something like this?

3. If you marry someone in the country, are you able to get divorced, and if you do get divorced, are they able to stay? Is there a certain amount of time you’ll be able to get divorced? 

I have more but I’ll start there. If there’s any more advice you think I should here please let me know. I have a lot of time to consider it. Thank you so much."
483,483,"Brother was abusive last night, I left the home to go to my sister’s place for safety only to have her husband attempt to drug me and try to sexually coerce me. (Maryland)","Reddit, my family is fucking garbage.

The parents are out of town for a funeral, my brother at some point got very drunk and lost his dab pen. He accused me of stealing it and proceeded to do up to $5,000 of damage to the home, eventually found it but refused to leave and physically attacked me during an argument.

I went to the commissioners office for a protection order and to filed forms for being the victim of second degree assault. 

I get done there, go to my sister’s home for refuge as I had no where else to go and the police were really pushing that I should leave for my safety.

My sister is out of town, but my nephew and his father were supposed to be there. Around 6am I ring their doorbell and my BIL (brother-in-law) answers. I explained what was going on and he said I could stay. My nephew was apparently staying at a friend’s home that night.
However when we go outside to smoke a cigarette he offers me weed and a rolling paper. I def need to unwind. However he then started telling me he wanted to see me shirtless. I put out the joint, smoking maybe 1/3 of it. He offered me shots of crown royal and I decline. He proceeded to talk about sex and how it’s a stress release, I try to steer the convo in some other direction. He asks me if I’m tired, offers me a shower and “his side of the bed”. I’m really tired and traumatized already so I move to another room, honestly trying to sober up ASAP to leave. He enters the room I’m in, gives me this weird hug where he basically caressed half my body and planted some open mouthed kisses on my face then mentions he’ll be getting naked in the other room and to join him and I decline. 

While my head was racing about what had happened, the police called me asking permission to enter the home where my brother was, they eventually call back to tell me he’s been told to vacate and that his dog was not secured (the sliding glass door shattered so the dog was able to escape) so I had to go back and deal with that. I swiftly left my sister’s place, still high, glad to leave. 

I don’t even know what to tell my sister, I’m going to wait for her to get back from vacation before I tell her what happened. Her husband had an affair earlier in the year so she was on the fence with the decision to divorce him. Telling her this news that her husband tried to take advantage of me while I was vulnerable will most definitely trigger the divorce if she doesn’t fucking murder him first.

I stayed pretty silent so her husband doesn’t know how upset I am. I know he owns firearms too so I’m a bit fearful of retaliation. Idk what I should do, should I fill another protection order?  What do I do?"
484,484,Can you snitch out of a DUI?,"My friend crashed his car drunk, was taken to the hospital, but was able to leave the following morning. He has since had nothing happen to him. His reasoning for nothing happening to him was first that, “the officer in charge is on vacation,” and now that he’s, “waiting for blood tests.”  The accident was over a month ago now.

Is it possible he snitched and didn’t get any charges? I don’t want to jump to conclusions but this all sounds unbelievable. Especially if you take into consideration that he has evaded serious charges in the past with similarly suspicious reasoning.

this took place in IA if that’s relevant"
485,485,Pregnancy Discrimination,"My wife works for a county is Wisconsin.  We have 2 children.  During each of her pregnancies, she asked for light-duty but was told ""there was none available"".  She ended up burning through her leave and had to take an unpaid leave of absence for both pregnancies.  

&#x200B;

Relevant facts:  Several others were given light duty assignments before and after my wife's leave.  In one case, a male was given light duty while my wife was off.

My wife went unpaid for a several months due to medical restrictions enacted by her doctor.

I believe she is out significant income and time towards retirement due to their lack of accommodation.

Pregnant women in the past have been reassigned to another area of the agency that would fall within their medical restrictions.

Men have been re-assigned to other departments when staffing was an issue.  I can show documentation of staffing shortages in the same department during the time she was denied light duty.  This would have fallen into her medical restrictions and has been done with others several times in the past.

She did file an FMLA request with HR and specifically wrote a request for light duty assignments.  I do not believe HR was involved in any of those decisions.

There is a part-time front office position that has ""hours as needed"".  I understand that this person continued to get hours during my wife's leave.  When asked about this, I understand the justification was that ""her hourly rate was higher than the part-timer"".  Pregnant women had been allowed to do this front office work in the past, however that's been 7 or 8 years.

My wife is prepared to leave employment here if we pursue this matter.  

We have both thought this was very wrong from the beginning.  She elected not to pursue anything in an attempt to ""be a team player"".      

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some questions:

1. This is super wrong, correct?
2. Doesn't a government agency have a duty to accommodate medical restrictions?  ie if there is work to do that falls within her medical restrictions, is their a duty to accommodate?  or can they just say ""we don't have anything available""?
3. I understand her employer to be the county, not the specific county agency.  Therefore, shouldn't they have sought light-duty work in other departments of the county?, (before completely denying her).  
4. I understand there are time limits for filing a complaint.  She is outside the window from when she was last denied, however, as they are currently allowing others to have light duty, desn't the clock re-set as males are freely being given light duty but she wasn't?
5. Does it pay to address any of this with HR, or just contact an attorney?

&#x200B;

Thanks or any help / advice.

&#x200B;

I think this is mostly about making sure others don't go through the same things we did.

486,486,"Discovered I was transgender 8 months into marriage, and 16 months into marriage we are divorcing mutually. In laws want to sue me for cost of the wedding. [TX]","I married my parter last year. 6 months in I went on antidepressants over some suicidal ideations. 2 months after that, and some research, I started to question some feelings I've had with me all my life but no therapist or counselor could ever identify. I went to see an LGBT specific therapist the week after I told her I was questioning my gender. She has loved and supported me the whole way. However after months of weekly therapy for me and couples counseling for us, we realize we cannot be happy as partners anymore and want to separate non-contested. So we can stay friends,which is really about how we turned out in the end. I filed 3 days ago. She submitted her waiver of service (or notice? I'm not in a very clear head rn) yesterday, fully notarized. She informed her parents. Initially they just talked plans of moving her back to their town.

They called again today saying they contacted a lawyer on my partners behalf about the situation and are trying to force her to sue me based on the grounds of it being a ""fraudulent marriage"". The entire cost of the wedding. She is forced to live with them when she goes back. I suspect they are going to threaten her with homelessness if she doesn't sue me. She has a job but no place to stay down there other than their house.

They want either a check of my savings, of which there's none, or to sue me for everything I'm worth. Which, again, isn't more than a few hundred. Since therapy and counseling and bills for 8 months means I'm living almost paycheck to paycheck.

We never combined finances. Never owned property. Everything was pretty much bought and owned seperately and we agreed to keep things as is in the paperwork. 

When I started therapy I didn't know I was trans. I was questioning. About 3 months of weekly therapy I figured out I  really was fully trans. I started hormones about 3 or 4 months after that. I still see this therapist and they definitely still have my file. 

The MiL is very manipulative and abusive. They are also very conservative and anti-trans. I believe they simply want to sue me to hurt me. And given my ex's history with her, I believe she will go through with it despite her not wanting to.

I'm not really sure what to do right now. I'm very scared."
487,487,"I want to voluntarily surrender my parental rights to a child I have never met and basically already have no legal rights to aside from paying child support. (Colorado, USA)","I (35 M) had a 10 day ""relationship"" with a Chilean woman (38). We communicated online for a few months before meeting in person. When we met her and I spent some time with her in person, I really really disliked her for many reasons.
 When she went back to Chile (after a 10 day visit with me in CO, USA) she was pregnant and now she is using this child to try and manipulate me into being in a relationship with her.
 She threatens me and my children from my marriage (I'm not married now and wasn't when the ""relationship"" occurred.) with violence, cyber bullying, legal action. She has threatened to kill herself if I don't go back with her, she sent me a picture of herself holding our child over a stair well and threatened to drop him if I didn't go back with her. She has threatened to jump off the building where she lives with our child if I won't go back with her, so many terrible things I won't recount them all. 
I have absolutely no legal recourse against what she is doing because I cannot engage in legal action in Chile. However, she can and has engaged in legal action against me, her in Colorado.
She opened a child support case with the county where I live in Feb of 2016, It took months to establish the case, paternity and everything else and then after 2 months of the child support order being in place, she is coming back after me for more money. She is using this as blackmail because I won't go back with her. I'm not assuming this is her motive, this is what she has told me many times. She knows that I can barely afford what I currently pay and that raising the amount will make things hard on me and my other children. That's the situation, my question is, can I voluntarily surrender my parental rights to this child and take away this little ""weapon"" (child support) that she is using against me? Does anyone have any helpful resources or a helpful direction to point me in? Thanks in advance. 
*EDIT* 
I am not actually trying to dodge paying support for this child. I am trying to take away the ability of this woman to pull me into courts and meetings with DHS and otherwise make my life (and my childrens lives) difficult. That is really my only goal. I already have no legal rights to this child, the situation is just her abusing, harassing, bullying and annoying me and my other children and because she lives in Chile, I cannot do anything about it. Taking away this child support case would be one small step to get her to back-off. 

TLDR: Got a Chilean woman pregnant and she uses the child support system to threaten me into a relationship with her. I want to simply surrender my parental rights to this child and disarm her. "

490,490,"[RI, USA] Downstairs neighbor is grade-10 snore-er causing loss of sleep","Going to try to keep this simple and not vent/rant and thanking you all ahead of time if take time to read/respond.

We started our lease mid-September. About a week in, we started to notice our neighbor below us snores extremely loud. For the first month, we have been able to either go to sleep before the snoring begins, but it's getting to the point where either a) the snoring wakes both myself or my partner out of a dead sleep, or b) if we happen to wake up in the middle of the night, the snoring keeps us awake. This person also has erratic sleep patterns and the snoring can also be heard/felt in our other room (we only have two, and the kitchen) at any given point.

I've already done some cursory research and the outlook isn't great. If a person is snoring this hard, most of the time they have ZERO clue or are in denial or hide behind their health condition and cry disability. Add to this that most landlords/property managers don't have a single fuck to give because all they care about is collecting rent.

Well, myself and my partner both have registered disabilities of our own and lack of sleep SEVERELY aggravates those issues. My partner is on SSI/SSDI and despite my own issues I work 40 hrs/wk. and the lack of sleep is starting to unravel my life. The stress this is causing is a massive strain on our relationship as we are both are constantly stressed out and under-slept.

So, here is what I know so far as options are concerned and what kind of push-back I expect from the property co.:

-Earplugs: Don't work because this is a bass frequency; this is snoring you FEEL, not hear.

-White-noise: Tried this too, but in order to drown out the snoring, the white noise is also too loud to sleep through

-Carpet/padding/soundproofing: An undue burden as in order to sound-proof my floor (hardwoods) a carpet and padding would be well near $1,000 I just don't have to drop on a whim (and our rent is $910/mo.)

-Change rooms: The layout of the apartment and our furniture would make this impossible

-Move the bed: The snoring permeates the entire room

-Record it and talk to the neighbor: Due to the fact it's not a volume but a vibration noise, I can't afford equipment that will actually pick this up

-Sleep-aids: Another undue burden - we will NOT risk becoming dependent to hardcore medications or build up a resistance to melatonin or something like Zzzquil which we use RARELY/as-needed on nights when we can't sleep due to our disabilities and usually result in waking up feeling like you're hungover

Edit: Formatting.
I plan to try to talk to the neighbors, but the folks that live in the unit below us don't speak English very well and I fully expect them to act like they don't speak English at all if I try to approach them or leave them a letter. I've also internalized guilt for being angry because I know this person likely also has sleep apnea and is either breaking through their treatment, ignoring treatment or can't afford treatment (CPAP machines are EXPENSIVE).

At this point, we just don't know what to do. We can't afford to move and the kind of property owners we have, based on how they strict they are about ""late fees"" and the general condition of the building, we aren't expecting even a sliver of compassion or empathy. I would bet money they would NOT be interested in relocating us and I cannot afford the time/money to move again even if they offer a different unit.

The feeling of being stuck in this situation is really destroying our mental state. We moved to this side of town because it's nicer, quieter and has significantly less crime. We love this unit and the location and it's infuriating/depressing this is what we have come in to.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and if you happen to have any advice to share, thank you so, so, so, so much! Have an awesome day, r/legaladvice!



Edit: Every single comment I make on this post is getting downvoted almost instantly after posting. I have a feeling either a bot or a troll/s or someone who just doesn't want me talking about this has an ax to grind and is trying to sink my worthless internet points. Isn't that... uh... breaking some rules?



Edit numero dos: My comment karma just shot up 40 points... so, huh. Weird. Either someone got banned, or someone else actually went through and counter-voted the downvote bot/troll.

Anywho, just talked to the rental office folks: It appears that it is indeed a new tenant who moved in recently, hence why we didn't notice this day one.

The gentleman who rented the unit to this person is going to call them to give them a heads up and see if they can open up a dialog with him. They also advised that I contact the occupancy manager via email to open a dialog there as well. They told me that if it does indeed get bad enough and there is a tenable unit of similar price/size/condition/location the likelihood of having to pay the transfer fee would be incredibly low and we would only be on the hook for our own moving expenses. Thankfully, all the units are in a relatively close proximity to eachother, so hopefully, if things come to pass as such, we do have options.

So, to all who genuinely contributed, from a legal or personal prospective, thank you SO much, really. Your input, advice and kind words have made this quite a bit easier to process and brainstorm around.

And to all the trolls, name-callers and those who pandered antagonism I only have this to say: I'm sorry your life is so miserable you feel the need to take it out on other people. I hope you get the help you need and maybe a hug or two sometime soon.

Edit # 3: and my comment karma just dropped 60-points. Sweet. Getting closer and closer to my negative karma bucket-list goal. Man, must have REALLY rustled some jimmies for people to sift through the entire thread (and possibly my post history) just to downvote everything.

Final Edit: thanks again to all who have contributed. I now have a LOT more to work with and a much better outlook on the situation as a whole. I appreciate you time and really can't thank some of you enough for the trully valuable feedback.

And a final note to the downboat brigade: If you guys just make two more throwaway accounts and downvote the whole thread again, I'll finally be at negative comment karma! It's a dream come true! THANK YOU SO MUCH LE REDDIT for showing, yet again, that internet points are srs bizness that you'd take the such precious time out of your life to go through my entire comment history just to downvote me because reasons I guess.

It is possible my descendants won't have to work again for many generations if I am smart in my lifetime.

However, this could all fall apart if I were to get divorced. I have seen so many people, men and women, absolutely destroyed during a divorce and lose everything they have taken twenty or thirty years to build. 

I have a stable life and I want to only increase that, not add undo risk into the equation.

My question is, what options do I have to prevent a divorce where I lose everything? Are there any options besides simply not getting married in the first place?

For example, Could I get surrogate mothers and then date my whole life? Could I put the index funds into an LLC that can't be touched in a divorce? Could I sign agreements for full child custody before ever having a child with anyone I am dating?

She's worked a low-level job for years, (though she's gotten promoted), just for one reason: to prove she can keep a job. All for her fourth child.

Her ex has full custody of her fourth child. He got custody because he has money, and used that money to hire a lawyer. Together, they told the judge she was a drug addict/using drugs, and the judge believed them, and awarded him full custody. (I'm sure they said more, but I don't have all the details, and this was the *main* thing.) She was caught off guard, *did NOT have a lawyer,* and was dumbfounded by the accusations. Seriously, she clammed up in shock and surprise. She says she was cut off when she finally tried to respond, and never got to rebut the accusations.

(**Edit:** she also was apparently convicted of a crime years ago in the past. Details are sparse, but she believed her kids were in physical danger, and used a vehicle that wasn't hers to flee. From what I've gathered, she didn't mount any legal defense, and thus she was convicted of theft.)

This was three years ago. Since then, he has been telling the child the reason she doesn't see her mommy that ""mommy doesn't want to see you.""

From what I've heard, he's a liar and a manipulator. And he uses drugs, at least one which was illegal until recently. She receives no child support. She has literally never used illegal drugs. She is actually a very kind, very patient, very loving, helpful, and dependable person. (I wouldn't say this about 80% of people I know, so I'm not just saying that.)

I fell asleep around 11:30pm, and woke up the next morning at around 8:30 in the morning.

I drove to work just fine, but as I was pulling in my parking space I just barely clipped a car. Oops, my bad, I get it, I have to figure this out. The owner of the other car was nowhere to be found, but I was lucky enough that a security guard was close enough to notice. She asked if everything was fine, I said yeah, and she said she'd have to take pictures and call the police. No big deal. I just made the mistake of assuming she'd had it taken care of.

I go to work in my office, and about an hour later my manager comes up to me and says he has to talk to me. There's two officers waiting and they immediately ask me if I'm drunk or on drugs. They then sobriety test me with their flashlight which went fine (but I'm still fucking trembling do to the fact that I NEVER have run ins with the cops.) They then continue to have me walk in a straight line which I totally struggled with, I think due to the fear?

I don't have an issue with helping pay for or even providing the labor and equipment to maintain the gravel on the driveway. 
My neighbor has chosen to mail a bid to us from a local contractor that costs $1050.

 I priced out 5 tons of gravel from the local quarry and 5 gallons of diesel from a local gas station and sent her my estimate if we performed the work with the equipment we can borrow from a family member that includes a dump trailer, a tractor with a box blade and front end loader and a plate compactor. We have experience with this equipment helping this family member with their own driveway and other mud abatement projects. My total estimate came to $126.35, of which I told her if she paid half, we'd be good.
She has instead chosen to stay with her original estimate from the contractor. That's fine, it's her property,  but I have an issue with being expected to pay at least half of his quote when we could do the same job for 10x less.
We wrote her a letter expressing our concerns with the cost and followed up with a text but she's not communicating with us. I think she is going to do what she did last time which was have the work done with no input from us and tape the bill to our door.
My next step will be to inform her in writing that my maximum reimbursement towards the work done will be the total of my estimate if we did the work.
I know she'll probably threaten small claims on us. If she does, how much of a leg would we have to stand on? I looked over the Oregon statute on shared maintenance but I don't see mention of how much each party is supposed to contribute."
3,3,"Seller didn't disclose termites, Inspector negligently missed them... do we have any recourse? [NJ]","We are new homeowners, and dealing with a nightmare lemon-house (purchased from out of state)... please help me figure out if we have any recourse with this particular issue. If not, this may financially ruin us.

* Seller indicated ""no"" on disclosure form to history of termites, and ""no"" to a history of contracts with pest control companies for termites. We hired an inspector (who offered an add-on termite inspection), and he didn't note anything wrong with the property. There is an active infestation in the foundation and  throughout the house. 3 separate opinions noted any competent inspector should have seen the issues. (I didn't know what to look for during final walkthrough, never grew up where termites were widespread).
* I called a few local termite treatment companies. One of the big companies said that they have an account at our address, under the seller's name. There are also a few knocked-down mud tubes on the property. We were told this is a standard procedure after treatment (so you can tell if they return). It looks like the Seller failed to disclose termites (or at least, having had a contract with the company, which was on the disclosure form).

Could the seller liable for some of the repairs we will need? (it is extensive unfortunately). Our contract did say something about advising buyers hire a professional exterminator to inspect for termites prior to closing (we unfortunately trusted our inspector as competent). Does that advise disqualify the seller from liability?

5,5,Possible eviction. What's my window for repayment to avoid being evicted?,"Case is on the 27th. I am certain I can repay all the due rent before the day but if I am a little short, would I still have time AFTER the hearing to submit a payment to avoid the eviction?"
6,6,Can I write scathing opinion pieces about the education industry without being sued for everything I own?,"Thanks in advance for any advice --- I'm seeking information on creating an anonymous blog and what I need to potentially be careful about in a legal sense.

I want to create a rant-style blog in which I bring up huge issues in a certain industry - education. I have the background knowledge and experience to do this knowledgeably. I'm going to avoid naming specific groups when I can, but there is the possibility that I go after bigger groups and established 'brand names' in education like Lucy Calkins and McGraw Hill. There's a lot of bullshit that needs to be called out. I don't plan on naming or calling out any individual school districts, but it's possible that one could come up.

My questions are as follows:

1. If I publish anonymously, what advice do you have when it comes to maintaining utter online anonymity?
2. What is the possibility or chance that a McGraw-Hill and Lucy Calkins would litigate if I criticized them? I don't plan on making any outlandish claims - just strong critiques of their negative impacts on educational trends. Should I be worried about lawsuits when it comes to critiquing big names in education industries? There's also a possibility that certain individual players could be named (shady CEOs or boards), but it's unlikely to be common.
3. Would an LLC be a good idea for this venture? If lawsuits are potentially a fact of life in this type of endeavor, should I form an LLC to ensure that my personal assets are protected? Would an LLC require me to give up my plans for anonymity?
4. Are there other options besides forming an LLC to protect or help a one-person anonymous blog/social media set-up?"

8,8,Am I a victim of insurance fraud?,"Hello guys,

I live in Ohio and back in December 2022 I got a new car insurance company. I was able to get a Non-Ownership policy for $66 a month which included the SR-22 Bond which I am required to hold due to being pulled over and not being able to produce proper insurance (long story short, and biggest lesson I can teach y'all, PAY FOR YOUR CAR INSURANCE!! It's not worth the legal hassles of not having a policy). So $66 was a deal. Well today (it's now April 2023) I went to pay my insurance and since I moved to another city, update my address. We attempted the address change and after I gave her my address she tells me that the new price is $91. Hold up, the new price? What do you mean the new price? We have a contract stating my monthly payments are $66. She informs me that your insurance price is based on where you live. So I look at my previous policy card I got and my address is in a whole nother city. Also might I add, upon Google Mapping the address they had on file, it doesn't even exist.  That's when I get really concerned because I'm a drug felon who's changed his life and is trying to get his rights restored so I can fully protect myself and my family, so I know the legal system a little. I get concerned because now since I know that 1. Insurance price is based on where you live and 2. My address they been had on file was wrong, am I going to fall victim of insurance fraud. So now I feel like I'm in a dilemma where if I don't change my address and make a payment I knowingly commit insurance fraud at this point, or I change my address and pay the $91 and continue my relationship with a company that knowingly commits insurance fraud further putting my legal safety at risk, or do I just go ahead and cut ties with this company and maybe pursue some kind of legal action.  Well to let y'all know, I did the 3rd one. I cut ties. I informed the CSR to cancel my policy due to the fraudulent activity happening with this company. So now I guess my question is this, since I had to cancel my policy I now don't have a valid Driver's License and my professions all require a Driver's License, can I sue the insurance company for damages lost due to not being able to work because they was commiting fraud under my name?  I'll reiterate what I said before, I did not know insurance price was based on where I lived so I definitely gave him the address I was residing at in that current time. I'm also temporarily disabled due to a PCL injury and what little money I did have was so I can still drive myself to my appointments. Which now I can't do. And the little bit of money I have won't cover the start of a new policy so this has greatly effected my quality of life. What should I do lawyers of Reddit. Please help.

9,9,Visible by Verizon sold me stolen iPhone!!!,"Hello, all. So, this is a new one for me. In January, I purchased an iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB thru Visible (financed with Affirm on Visible's checkout page). I paid $429.73 immediately with Amex as a down payment and the rest l've been paying monthly. Already having a phone, I never activated it and it's still brand new in the box. I ran the IMEI when I got it and it was clean. I ran it again yesterday when I intended to port out of Visible.  Guess what! It's been reported stolen by AT&T Mobility.

I learned from Verizon (not Visible) that the number assigned to me by Visible originated from Cingular.  Beyond that, I am unaware of any connection with AT&T, and still cannot fathom a scenario in which this could occur. Other than some back and forth in Visible chat and in Twitter DMs, I am getting nowhere, although I've been informed my case has been escalated. Has anyone experienced any of this nonsense before?

Also, now I have two phones I cannot sell, the ""stolen"" one and another iPhone 14 Pro Max I purchased directly from Apple (as it is tied to my Visible number now, I can't terminate service and maintain account access with Visible). I've copied every single thing from their website in case I lose access anyway, but haven't cancelled yet in case I need to chat with them again.

Currently, I've communicated with Visible only. I suppose next, I need to inform Affirm and Amex, if for nothing else than to make them aware.

Does anyone here in Tampa have any recommendations for an attorney specializing in corporate fraud cases??

Also, would now be a good time to contact the Tampa PD and file a report with them too??

Thanks!

10,10,NEED HELP!! Contractor refuses to continue work and has taken materials ordered for our project,"We hired a contractor to build a gable patio for us in the backyard. The contractor had originally quoted us 4 weeks to finish this project. We have a contract, which outlines a payment schedule by time. Such as week 1 an X amount will be paid, Week 2 X amount will be paid (I know this was our mistake, we should have done by the work done instead) . The first week things were slow, demolition took way longer then it should have. The contractor assured us that thing will pick up. Second was the same as well, yet we adhered to the payment schedule.  By the end of week 3, ~ 70% of the work was done. But the rest still remained. But there was no change as week 4 concluded, and he asked for money so we told him we won't be releasing any money as there no progress from the previous week. After a long and heated discussion we ended up give him the check. At this point,  we have given 92% of the amount agreeed upon by bother parties and the last 8% was to be delieved upon finishing the project. The week later he came back and asked for more money. We refused as its not in the contract we signed. And he came back with change orders, (changes that we supposedly made to the scope of work). Most of the items were already in the scope of work disscussed and signed by him and I. So we refused them as well. He then took the marterial for our project  and refuses to give it back. The dudes an 80 year old man, who is kinda racist ( we are immigrants).  I just want to know what I can do. He refuses to meet, our original idea was to have him sign an agreement where we release the remaining 8% of the money in parts after certain things of the project are completed. To the best of our knowledge, we have not breached the contract. Would love some help in this manner. He keeps threatening liens on us if we don't pay. We live in Texas btw."
11,11,Seeking advice,"Hi all. I am looking for some legal representation, if appropriate. I have been a resident of my complex for almost 7 years (I rent, most own). It is mostly elderly and retired people that live here. Randomly I received a call from a manager that we no longer have access to the clubhouse and pool due to a neighbor complaining that the club house bathroom smelled like marijuana and the video footage was reviewed and my 15-year-old daughter and her boyfriend had both used the bathroom, separately. I drug tested my daughter, negative for THC, told them she is an ""a"" student that has never touched drugs, but they stated, ""too many other things had happened"". I was sure there was a misunderstanding so I wrote an appeal letter requesting reconsideration, notified them that the drug test was negative, and my daughter had footage on her cell phone with no behavior that would be considered against the club house/pool rules. They replied with a letter claiming over the years that there has been damage to pool table, burns on the table, ornaments missing from the tree, and other issues. These are all new accusations without any merit, proof, no police reports, or notification to our unit to date. They haven't' been able to walk the dog without someone telling them that they need to clean up after themselves, which they have never done anything but be respectful and responsible. They are the only children, living among the elderly, and sometimes just their presence is enough to annoy the residents. We were also told in the past that my oldest daughter's boyfriend needed to be walked up to the unit, no other teenagers, just him as he made the lady residents ""uncomfortable"". He is black and young. My youngest daughter's boyfriend is also black, and he had been in the club house a total of 2 times the day we were kicked out for life. Is this something that should be handled through a lawyer? I have 14 more months on my lease."
12,12,"I'm suing Ebay, small claims, any pointers?","I bought an item for nearly $500. The item got to my post office and the package was returned to the seller. We just bought and moved into this house, I've received  FedEx, UPS and Amazon,  but ohhh no, not the US Mail! The return of this item is not really a big deal to me, what IS, are the tracking details, loss of money and loss of time.

The tracking clearly shows the package being shipped, arriving to my post office, noted Insufficient Address and you can see it traveling allll the way back to the dirt bag seller. It's scanned at the sellers post office....AND THEN, for whatever reason, says ""Delivered front porch"" with MY TOWN, not his!!!!

The seller is his own kind of d-bag, instead of canceling the order so I get my money back and he gets reimbursed for shipping so we can then do the whole transaction over again...this guy tells Ebay he shipped it and keeps my money and keeps his item! It's all there clear as day in our messages. He acknowledges having the item and demands I pay more shipping! Ha, I'm not paying another DIME. Cancel the order!!

This is where I quit talking to the seller and kindly ask Ebay for my money back as I never received the item. Ebay takes one lazy look at the tracking, that does indeed say ""Delivered, ..my porch"" and says they show it Delivered, please check with my neighbors or behind the bushes. OMFG. Any normal human could objectively look at the tracking and see the ""delivered"" part didn't happen. A giant package can't go from California to Colorado in four hours!! On top of that, I have messages from the seller detailing his possession of the item. They did not care. I appealed the case, they closed it citing the tracking stating it was delivered!!

Ok, fine, I'll go to my bank. Chase gave me my money back....for a month, then took it back saying they communicated with Ebay and Ebay says its a legitimate sale. Chase wont help you. I even appealed to their escalations team who after reviewing FOURTEEN PAGES of documented evidence said ""its been too long"". RIDICULOUS.

I am absolutely furious. My wife and I closed all of our Chase accounts and moved to a credit union. After 23 years of Ebay I'm never going back and I wanna sue their pants off..or at least get what's mine. 

Anybody been here before? As far as I know, all I have to do is go down to my court house, fill out the paper work and pay a fee.

Edit: forgot to mention I have detailed tracking showing and a letter from the postmaster stating it was never delivered to me."

We paid the remaining lawyer fees and filing fees. It now mid April our case has not been filed. We have reached out to get an update and a timeline but they are now unresponsive. I could not get a hold anyone on any of the phone numbers provided. My next step is to write a formal letter and send it with receipt demanding reasons they haven't been responding to us.

It says that the work/materials furnished started in Late November 2022. It lists my address as the jobsite and an original contractor, who is not the company filing the lien. We're in New York State.

But I need some advice. My husband and I are so stressed out about this I’m trying to keep peace and handle the situation. 

Long story short we just had a so called roommate move out Thursday. Broke the lease 6 months in, less than 2 weeks notice. She told my husband she’d pay the utilities and clean the next day. Last night she got all upset and texted my husband asking why everyone was being rude to her. When… 

Our other roommate has never spoken to her. She ignored him. She hates me and has never given me a reason why (everything was great the first two months, we were even friends before and her and husband used to work together the last year.) she is causing so much unnecessary drama it’s affecting all of us and we believe she’s doing it on purpose. I don’t know if I should contact my landlord and let him know what’s going on. If I’m being honest he never really liked her, she kept texting and emailing him about problems with the sink/toilet/lights when we’ve had the plumber come more than 4x to check and everything was fine. I’ve even done some handy work down there. He was upset she broke the lease halfway. 

I want her to pay her half (she did rent) get the rest of her stuff, leave the keys(she made copies and gave em out no joke) and leave. That’s it but she’s pitching a fit. This woman has a masters, works full time, holds so much hatred and grudges it’s uncomfortable (even our friends could feel the tension coming into our home). This isn’t fair, I wrote out a message that I’m gonna send Monday. I told my husband to block her number for now. Are we in the wrong here? Please any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I then yelled at my dog to get away wich she did the officer then jerked me to continue walking toward the end of the driveway. He then jerked me again at which point I told him “chill out” and before I new it he legged swept me from the front causing me to land straight on my head.

After graduating, the school reached out with the following:

""Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that the instructor who taught you the required reading standards did not meet the new faculty qualifications under a recent state rule that was passed. Because of this, we now need you to complete an additional course with a qualified reading instructor before we can submit your license materials to the proper licensure association."" They covered the course for me. 

I completed the class and still haven't gotten my license yet this year as the teacher still hasn't put in final grades for the course (and the course was a total joke, it took me roughly two hours to complete (all online) and the professor took 2+ months respond to any request). Obviously, I was declined from all teaching jobs I applied to during this time while I didn't have a license. I've taken a job in a childcare, just trying to make ends meet right now.

30,30,Someone cancelled my insurance and my dog suddenly got sick,"I’ll try to keep this short, but basically I need some advice on who to talk to about this situation. 

I have pet insurance for my dog and he became very sick, so I logged into the insurance app and it said my account said it was cancelled. I was confused as I’ve never missed a payment. I called them and they said they got an email from my email canceling the account. There is no way someone accessed my account because Google tells you. There is also no sent email from my account. They said there was. 

I am waiting on the tests to come back to see if he was poisoned. I have no idea how this happened or who could have done it. Do I talk to the police? Should I find a lawyer? Should I try to contact the insurance again?

My dog is doing better now and I paid for vet bills out of pocket, which is fine. My main concern is that the insurance was cancelled and then he got sick within a week. I have gone through the list in my head and I can figure out who knew I had that insurance and also who would do this. I generally keep to myself and I don’t feel like I have anyone who would do this to me."

Additional question. If I were to use that same art for my avatar on social media platforms that I am making money off, therefor it would in a way be used as my own marketing tool (I assume?), could I get in throuble then?

35,35,Month to month lease regulations,"So I might post this on a few different subreddits, as I don't know where people migrate for these type of topics.

We have lived in our current apartment for almost 7 years. We haven't signed a lease in around 3 years so we have been month to month tenants, complied with every rent increase etc. 

We recently found a new place to move to and I applied 2 months out. The application process, finding out if we got approved, getting the lease etc took a while. We finally got the lease the first week of April and signed the week after (after reading it thoroughly). That new lease starts on 5/1. 

So we notified our current landlord that we were moving and he said he needs 60 days notice. Now my primary question is, how can he require a 60 day notice on a month to month lease? The whole point of a month to month is either landlord or tenant can terminate the agreement with 30 days notice. Now I looked it up and most states say 30 day notice for a month to month is law. We live in Michigan. 

Our landlord is saying that because expired lease from years ago says 60 days that we have to abide by that. I'm having a hard time understanding how Michigan law for month to month is 30 days notice but he's saying because the expired lease says 60 days that it's still 60 days. They can't both be true. One must trump the other. And as far as I'm aware, law trumps policy. Giving 60 days notice on a month to month lease is like giving 2 years notice on a year lease. It's nonsensical. 

Anyway, because we effectively only gave him 16 days notice, we thought that we could offer to stay till the end of May... which would be 47 days notice in total. We would just use the month of May to move slowly and have to eat the cost of 2 rent payments for the month. 

Is this reasonable? We have lived there for almost 7 years so its not like he can move someone in right after we vacate. He will need to renovate the place and do maintenance that he didn't do while we lived there. He also will just keep our security deposit anyway. What should we do?

If someone knows the correct answer, or what laws to point me too I would appreciate it. We are due with our third child this Summer and don't want to be dealing with a court case while I'm in labor/about to have a baby. Thank you."

38,38,"Purchasing, registering, and insuring a vehicle in another state","Hi, all! I live in Louisiana where insurance rates are skyrocketing. I’m looking at purchasing a new EV. There aren’t any stores here so I was planning to go look at some different models in my home state of Maryland, where both of my parents still reside in my childhood home.

Apparently Maryland has some law that they can’t sell EVs out of the state supposedly, so that gave me the idea of registering the car with my dad.

I have the utmost trust in my dad, so no issues there. If we registered the car as co-owners and I drove it primarily in Louisiana, would there be legal issues with that?

What if I were to purchase the car and be on the loan, but not on the title/registration if that’s even possible and only have it in his name in Maryland?

Anyway, I guess since its been in the same place for nearly two weeks^(it was parked for the week I was gone & I've been back almost a week) and because I have generally nosy neighbors with **zero** chill, someone called to report it. I'm trying to get in contact with the owner of the AirBnB I stayed at to see if she'd be willing to stop by the place and take a look for me, but that could take some time. Until then, does anyone know if its possible to call someone and explain the issue, or at least ask for a bit more time before they haul it off? And if so, who exactly would I call? Would it be the police, or maybe the number I found online dedicated to *reporting* ""abandoned"" vehicles? 
Thanks y'all!"
40,40,(UK) Boss Withholding Pay for Hours Worked After Missing Work Unexpectedly,"Hi all,

I recently began working part time at a local pub the last four weeks. All was going well until I had to unexpectedly miss a weekend shift to deal with family matters. After that my boss did not schedule me for the following weekend, and has not given me my pay for hours worked the week prior to leaving unexpectedly. I’ve checked with other staff who worked that week and all have received their pay from that week. 

After I reached out to my boss to ask why I was not scheduled for the following weekend, they simply responded that they would like to meet with me when I am back from dealing with my family matters.

What is my legal recourse here in the UK if my boss opts to terminate my employment, and refuses to pay me for the hours worked?"

They send maintenance and he insists he can’t smell anything, again refusing to do an actual test.

It is for my brother and I to have the artifact of our father’s will. It is an important part of him, especially since our time with him was so short. We look for anything. I don’t think asking 30 years later - now I am 46 - is unreasonable. But my mother apparently does and angrily refuses and tells me to ask someone else. Which would be weird and was when i did do that. Asking for the last will from for your own father apparently makes people become suspicious of you,, which is not the case.

47,47,Do I have to pay for damages to door after being locked out?,"I just signed the lease to an apartment yeaterdya. They did not tell me that the door key did not unlock both the locks on the door, which I feel is a reasonable assumption to make. I checked the apartment out and then locnked up and went back to my old place to start moving in. When I got back, I couldn't get in because my key didn't work in the bottom lock. I really needed to move in then and the office was closed for the weekend and timing was off the essence. Also, I didn't have a number for emergency maintenance, so I kicked the door in. I can still secure the door with the top lock, but there is ñ the door frame and a little bit to the door itself.

Do I (or my insurance) have to pay for the damage because I kicked the door or do they have to pay the damage because I was not informed that there was no key for the bottom look or that it didn't work? My mom told me the former and a friend told me the latter."
48,48,[FL] Falsely evicted by someone buying the house without the landlord's knowledge or consent,"Apologies for repost. This was originally posted under the flair for Real Estate law. My landlord made a good point though, that they weren't liable for anything for her, but as the tenant, I should be. I thought I'd reflair and get a second opinion since my original post was buried. Doubt it'll make a difference, but figured I'd try my luck. Sorry if this breaks any rules!

Our story will take place in Tallahassee, Florida. On March 12th, 2022, I received a ""Termination of Tenancy"" notice from- let's call her, Kunt. At the time, Kunt was my landlord's roommate, and my (duplex) neighbor's mother. Prior to receiving this notice, my neighbor has frequently spoken to me about how horrible and manipulative her mother was. Kunt shows up at my door and hands me this notice, explains that my landlord is retiring and has sold the property to her. She offered a very generous amount of time to move out (May 15th, 2022), and even an incentive to move out early. Up to this point, I had been living at this property for probably about three years. 

Not particularly relevant legally, but for some context:
My landlord is incredible. I'd had many issues with my mental health back then, and every time my landlord was so very forgiving about late rent payments and any drama I caused them. At the time, I had also just broken up with my partner, who moved into that house when I first got it. I loved that house, and considered buying it on multiple occasions. Needless to say, with everything going on at the time, I simply cried about the situation and cursed the forces that be for giving me such a rough time.

I had assumed that the sale was a done deal, and never bothered to ask my landlord about it. Fast forward to now. Comparatively, I am living in a far worse place with far more people than I'd ever wanted in my home. I've had several of my belongings stolen, damaged, and destroyed. I had to sell a lot of very valued things in order to even have space to live. Despite all that, I am doing well for myself. The only unfortunate thing is my living situation! I'm having to move, now for the third time, and thought I'd message my former landlord and offer my appreciation while I was in the headspace of having to move (quietly hoping she would potentially know of any affordable places to live in my area).

Well! My landlord texts me back shorty after asking, ""What retirement? What eviction notice?"" For those who can't pick up on context clues (or those who neglected to read the title), THE EVICTION NOTICE WAS FAKE. Kunt lied to my landlord by telling her that I was okay with moving out given sufficient time and she never thought to question it. According to my landlord, Kunt signed a contract to (if I understood correctly) buy the house on May 11th, but the house was never sold until April 30th. The notice I was given specifically states that the property had been sold to her, signed by her and everything. I even kept it for sentimental value!

Basically, I'm wanting to know if we have a case, and if so, what could either of us ever even hope to get out of this? I don't imagine she could be forced to return the house for buying it under false pretenses, but that would be my dream scenario. I'm young and completely ignorant legally. I made the mistake of telling my former neighbor all this (again, her daughter), and now Kunt knows I'm onto her. I assured her I was too broke and busy moving to a different state to take legal action, but that was only in the hope that she wouldn't preemptively start preparing a defense. I want justice for myself, my landlord, and my neighbor (who, I failed to mention is a single mother. I suspect this situation arose due to the mother wanting to manipulate her daughter and control her, and her granddaughter's life) I will take any and all advice here. Thank you generous redditors so very much for this and everything you do on this sub. Even if my situation is a bust, you're making a difference."
49,49,TX - apartment landlord won’t treat for bedbugs despite proof. This will be my third time requesting bedbug extermination services,"Shortly after moving in to the apartment in September, I noticed I was getting severely bitten by bedbugs in multiples of 3. Called landlord and they sent pest services that said they didn’t find any despite seeing all the bites on me. Said it was mosquitoes. Called again in March of 2023 with bites and a picture. Was told it was not a bedbug despite the bites in multiplies of three and the photo (albeit blurry). I now have physical evidence and bites and am going to call again. 

My questions are do I have any recourse in suing for rent for all the months I had them and they refused to treat? Can I sue for the amount of the pest services if they finally agree to treat (they said we would have to pay). Can I make them inspect my adjacent neighbors? Any resources would be helpful."

51,51,Billed for No Services Rendered,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, not sure exactly where it belongs.  This is in PA.

In 2018 my husband and I purchased a LG washer and drier.  The salesman convinced us to purchase a warranty which we later realized was money wasted.  The warranty was from Consumer Protection Services (CPS).

In January the washer dies and we are in dire straights because we have a newborn and are using it for multiple loads daily.  We submit a claim using the CPS website.  The claim is accepted and a company called LG Electronics Alabama, Inc is assigned the repair with a date scheduled.  In the meantime we are frantically searching for a place that can repair it sooner. 

We find another repair place and the washer gets fixed.  LG Electronics Alabama, Inc gets in contact with my husband for the appointment and he cancels it (he has all the texts saved).  I checked the CPS website and couldn't find a way to officially cancel the claim online so I just left it open.  Probably should have called to talk to someone but had other newborn stuff to do.

Fast forward to yesterday and we receive a bill in the mail for $268 for ""Service call not covered under warranty”.  Bill dated 4-11.  Of course we call and can't get through so I send an email to the address listed on the bill explaining the situation and asking for proof of services rendered.

If the appointment was cancelled and no services were provided I can't just be billed, right?  I am hoping this is just a mistake, but if CPS pushes back, what are my best options?  I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a fighting a ding on my credit for not paying a fabricated bill."
52,52,Resigning & breaking contract early,"I’m a physician assistant in Georgia looking to resign from my position only a few months in to a multi-year contract. Biggest stipulation in the contract is having to repay a training fee (which training - or lack thereof - is one of the reasons I’m leaving) if you leave before the end of the contract.
Multiple PAs have left over the past year for various issues, all related to the toxic and unethical work environment.
I guess I have 2 main questions:
1) How much (or how little) should I say in my conversation with my boss telling them I’m resigning/in my follow-up resignation letter? I don’t necessarily want to come across as threatening, but I have consulted an attorney and will hire one if necessary.
2) What is the likelihood my employer will take me to court for the training repayment? From what I know, she has not taken any of the previous PAs who have left early to court, only sent vague legal letters."

54,54,ADA reasonable accomidation request..employer stalling,"I will be right up front and say that what happened to me at work doesn't sound very serious to most but it broke me.

I have a diagnosis of GAD and Complex PTSD. After an incident at work caused a flair up of very debilitating symptoms I requested an accomidation for my health and safety. My company has been dragging thier feet, requesting medical input and letting me know they are ""working on it"". I have exhausted my PTO. I know they have all the medical records from my doctor and they still have not agreed to any reasonable accomidations. This situation is just exacerbating my symptoms. It's been weeks. 

My request was a simple work from home solution. It is already a standard practice for the company. 99% of my work is done via email so there would be no hardship or unreasonable expenses accociated. I have been restricted by my doctor to avoid the trigger for my panic attacks, so that means no going into the office at all. Because they are unwilling to restrict the person's access to my area. The incident resulted in a slap on the wrist for them and I was informed they are a ""valued member of the team"". That is it. The person had been escalating thier behavior. I no longer feel safe and I started having panic attacks. 

Do I have enough cause to complain to my state labor board or the equal opportunity commission?

Just from the way they handled the origional incident I know they are acting in bad faith but how do I prove it?

55,55,"Loaded question, model release, intimidation","I am a photographer. I never share any images without a model release. Ever. I have model releases on file from 2012 still. 

A former friend/client and I parted ways. For personal reasons not business. When things like this happen, despite my model release I remove images. It’s drama I don’t need or want for my business. No one has ever asked me to take their images down, I just do it on my own. 

Now to the dramatics of the story. 

Former Client, is a legal staff member for a government agency in the area. 
Former Client also is a bully. She found my”private”  social media account  (public account, my own fault, but for personal use)
And commented something on it. I took a screen shot of her comment and shared it. 

Her profile picture, is a photo I took of her family. 

She’s currently telling people I am harassing a public official but sharing private images of her family. (The screen shot included the profile picture that she used when she chose to comment on my stuff)…. She’s telling people she’s planning to sue me. 

The thing is, i still hold the model release. She’s never once asked me to take anything down, and the photo in question is one she put up on her social media.

I guess my question is, is there a legal limit on model releases in the USA? 

Also, does she have any legal grounds for harassment when she commented on my stuff? I’ve since blocked her, and coincidentally since then I’ve received an influx of fake account requests to all of my socials. 

Isn’t “intimidating BY An elected official” against some law? She has claimed her boss (an actual lawyer) supposedly agrees my sharing of the image is harassment."
56,56,My apartment neighbor is insane and being harassing. Can I leave the lease without legal trouble?,"First off, a little bit about me I’m 26 and live with my boyfriend. We put down a deposit of $2600 to live in a apartment in LA, we are new to our careers and in the case of breaking our lease we would like this deposit back. 

 We just moved to this apartment 1 month ago and the day we moved in a women who lived next to us watched us move into our home while sitting on a patio chair. Which normally isn’t too odd however we started at 9pm and ended around midnight. She just watched us the whole time out in the cold night, moving boxes into the home from a uhaul. 

About 3 days upon my move in I noticed dirty cat food dishes at my back door and the walk way in front of my apartment unit. Which is odd because she has her own space for this in front of her own door and stoop. 

This went on for the next two weeks. Eventually, when my sister came down to visit me and while walking into my house my sister asked me about the bowls.  I said, “yeah I don’t know, she puts her cat bowls here by my door and in the walkway. It’s annoying” 
Which then my sister said “you should put it back in front of her own door!“  
Then BOOM! the lady who puts the cat bowls there slams her door as loud as she can. 
I’m not sure if her door was open and slammed it or if it was always open.  
Obviously, it was not the best way to handle it. I really didn’t know she was listening. 

The next morning my boyfriend and I were in the kitchen with our window open talking about our plans for the day. All the sudden we hear a loud “F*ck you b*tch!!!!
The women came out to feed her cats and on top of her lunges started screaming “F**ck  YOU!! F*ck you!!! B*tch!! This isn’t your territory! I can do what I want!!-“ and stuff like that for the next 10 minutes. Yelling to no one but facing my unit. Im assuming this regarding what my sister and I said the day before and she must of hear us. 

But it didn’t stop there. Then she went to the center of the plaza, which is next to our unit and sat there for a while muttering stuff. 

 Since my boyfriend and I were leaving out of town for Easter, so we were packing at this time. After a while we can hear her yelling from her door again to us. The same 5 sentences over and over. “F**ck  YOU!! F*ck you!!! B*tch! Something-something in my family committed suicide!! You don’t know what I been through, this isn’t your territory!! F*cking C*nt!!” This yelling went on for about half a hour. I have never heard someone yell like this! 

Then she started blasting her music with her door open and was yelling from inside her home yelling “YOU LIKE THAT? F*ck you!!” And the sound of the music, her screaming and stuff crashing in her own home. This lasted till the afternoon. Since we needed to leave anyways we just decided to leave out the door safely holding pepper spray in case. 

After talking about the situation, we decided to txt the landlord and told her everything that happened. She replied with this message:  “Hi, I am currently out of country. I will forward your message to the office so they can reach out to her. This is the first time I heard about her disturbing behavior. She has always been quiet and keep things to herself. She has been there for 6+ years and we never received any complaints. Maybe she just had a bad day, but I will have office reach out to her tomorrow.” 
I agreed with my landlord said thank you.
I figured things would solve themselves out. However, the following day I came home around 10pm and found that the women and walked around to my garden stuff and around it she make a 4x4ft pentagram out of large stones and shells. It’s so perfect, it must have taken her a while. 

I’m assuming she’s trying to scare me?  Or she’s trying to curse me or something. I don’t know, It was just unsettling. 
I sent the picture to my landlord and haven’t touched the stones or removed the pentagram. 
My landlord never responded.

This was all 5 days ago and the crazy lady has  been silent until today. Two hours ago my boyfriend went to his car and was siting in it removing trash for about 10 minutes. He said he opened the door to get out and she yelled out from her window to him - “This isn’t your fucking territory!!! F*ck you!! F*ck you!!! This isn’t your territory!!” My boyfriend said it startled him, especially since it was 1am and dark. 
He didn’t expect her to be watching from her back window and yell at him. He said he shut his door and drove away to the other side of the apartments to avoid her.

My boyfriend and I are talking about it, we both feel like she’s possibly on drugs or something. 
My boyfriend is also leaving for two weeks soon and doesn’t feel like it’s safe to leave me here alone now. We are asking ourselves what we can do? 
We are only a month in and it’s already so uncomfortable to be here with her acting like this. We feel like we are walking on eggshells here. I share a closed in parking garage with her too, luckily I haven’t ran into her yet. I have to walk by her door to get to mine and now I don’t even wanna garden in my backyard since she can come out. 

Can we do anything to back out of this lease? Besides pictures of the pentagram we have no video evidence of her screaming and yelling at us to deliver to the landlord. 
So I guess what I’m asking is, is there a legal way we can get outta here to find good safe apartment? Can we break the lease and keep our deposit with what’s going on? 
What steps do we take? 
Thanks for reading."
57,57,Could I sue my employer?,"I currently work at a government agency. I have been with them for 2 years now. My position is Janitoral. I took the job thinking it would be a great way to get my foot in the door. I have applied to  10 positions within the same organization. They always hire outside the agency people with no experience then give me a chance. This last thing set me over the edge was we got a new Janitoral hire.

Human Resources also told her that there was no probationary period she had to wait for her to apply. Mind you, when I got hired on I was told that I had to wait six months before I could even apply for a job with in the agency. We both put in our applications for the job postings. She got the job offer with no experience and being with us for less than a month. Human Resources is bias she also sits in on the interviews. I feel like I didn't have a fair chance. Human Resources has never done anything like that for me. Why go above and beyond for someone new? When you have a loyal and reliable employee, that's been with you for 2 years. How are they going to hire someone with no prior experience that has been with us less than a month? It's not fair! I will be giving my resignation letter because they are not an equal opportunity employer. They don't value there employees.  This is not the first time Human Resources and I had issues.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading."
58,58,Employer owes me three paychecks and refuses to pay,"Last summer my paychecks were running behind the scheduled pay dates at my job of 31 years.  In July they became a few days past the legal limit when I was told the business was being evicted the next morning, abruptly ending my position.  When I did not receive pay, I of course filed with the Minnesota Department of Labor, following their instructions.  They started an investigation (which consisted of two phone call attempts) and eventually told me they had no power to do anything, and I should take it to court - which I did.  I won the case (unsurprisingly), but there has been no response from the business owner.  I have docketed the judgment, and filed for an Order of Disclosure, which he has ignored.  

Going through the court system has been difficult, and every document I file costs me $50 -$60. I have so far sunk several hundred dollars in to this attempt.  Is there any other course of action I can take to actually collect my pay? Not only does this violate business law, as wage theft it is also criminal, but I don't know if it is ever enforced. I have also talked to the Federal Department of Labor, who told me they have no jurisdiction.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

60,60,Cousin was seriously injured at work because of negligence and boss filed bankruptcy and now my cousin is left with thousands in hospital bills,"I haven’t been able to talk with my cousin because he’s back at work (new job). Trying to pay back all the hospital bills from the accident. But basically he got crushed by many tons of hay bales and his boss wouldn’t take blame and basically filed for bankruptcy (I’m pretty that’s the term for what he did , but not 100%, I just know his boss was shady and didn’t want to pay the bills or get in trouble, and basically left him hanging). Thankfully he’s recovered ( but he will have long-term injuries I’m sure) My cousins family can’t afford excellent legal help, but I’m wondering if anyone has any advice on this situation and if it’s worth pursuing so they could hopefully get some money for his bills. I really don’t know how to help, I just can’t believe the situation and how he was the one who got messed up so badly and now has to work even harder to pay for someone else’s mistake that caused his injuries. :/"
61,61,How to keep the fact that I was the victim in a child sexual abuse case private when I have to include it on my bar application?,"The state is MA, if that helps.

The C&F question is ""*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*""

I was a victim-witness in a child sexual abuse case and I also sued my abuser after the criminal case concluded.

I don't want this to become public record. I don't want the entire board of bar examiners knowing this sensitive information about me if it's avoidable. And I certainly I don't wish for the bar examiners to contact me or anyone in my family to ask questions about it.

It has zero bearing on my ability to practice law. It seems crazy that I have to include legal actions in which I was not the party who caused the harm.

I was *three years old* when the harm began (or at least when it was first independently verifiable--most likely began earlier than that.) It seems crazy that anything that happened that long ago should have to be included on my bar application. What's next? Do I have to include my kindergarten disciplinary record?

Is there anything I can do to keep this private, totally irrelevant information private?

And how many documents do they expect me to dig up for this? Finding documents (perhaps having to request documents from a court in another state) from the cases is going to cause more emotional distress than I want to be dealing with during exam. Is there any way to avoid this? I hate this."
62,62,Friend getting extorted and blackmailed on Instagram,"My friend did something really stupid and some random girl texted him and exchanged nudes. This supposed “girl” then got everyone that followed him into a group chat and said if he didn’t cash app 400 dollars they would send his nudes to everyone.

Most of the car is going to be constructed from externally sourced parts, which will limit my upfront manufacturing costs and allow me to be slightly more economical at a small business scale.

64,64,Can I garnish the bank account of my husband (who is spending literally HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS on his mistress) for nonpayment of temporary alimony?,"The trial is almost a year away. He was court-ordered to pay alimony pendente lite, and he just stopped paying (purely out of anger), giving no notice to me or his lawyers. His noncompliance is EXTREME. He has already been held in contempt twice over other matters, and there are additional contempt motions pending.  He is not at all dissuaded by contempt motions. He is self-employed, so I can’t garnish his wages. He was also court-ordered to cover our expensive health insurance premium, and he stopped paying that as well. I am chronically ill and need medication that costs tens of thousands per month without insurance.  "
65,65,Do I have verified complaint about not receiving a rest break. I’m in Cali,"So I want to do something, I honestly don’t care if I get any money out or anything I just want the company I worked for to change their way of practice 

So here’s the situation:

I was employed by ******* with hours of 30+ a week roughly during my time of employment. Since the date hired I was not allowed to take a second rest break if I had worked 7.5hrs or more. And I had  if worked 5hrs or more and had taken a meal break I was not allowed to take a single rest break. When I had asked my managers if I could take one I was told that it was either too busy to take one or a response whereabouts of “you want a 10? I haven’t even taken a break” with no indication of yes or no but it pretty much meant that I wasn’t able to take one; on the off chance that I would take it upon myself to step out after notifying my coworkers that I did so, a manager would come looking for me and tell me that I had to go back to work even though I would inform them that I was trying to take a break. After awhile it had become clear that I was not able to take a meal break and a rest break without any type of snide remark that had an implication of denial of a rest break. I eventually stopped asking. It is not only myself who has had this experience, all my coworkers have aswell

I want to file a wage complaint with the labor commissioner but I don’t have any type of proof, I feel like like if I go the legal route they would have some sort of an investigator or whatnot that would be able to witness employees not able to take their rest breaks.
I have work for this company for over 5yrs"
66,66,How do I prove custody of an unborn child?,"Long story short, my ex is pregnant with my child. We get along just fine. I don't think any issues will arise but I am worried she might run off with the soon to be kid. We both currently live in MT. She is planning on moving in with her parents in WI before the kid is born. I have no texts or written stuff from her stating the kid is mine. Everything happened verbally. I want to have every part as much as her in the raising of our kid. The situation seems civil but I want to make sure if things go south that my kid isn't just gone from my life because I might not be able to prove it's my kid. I hope that I can be present for the birth but at the end of the day it's her decision not mine

I am 30 and she is 38 if that helps clear anything up"
67,67,Car insurance personal injury,"Was in a wreck the other driver was deemed at fault and cited by police. His insurance called me and said they accept 100% of fault and wanted information from me. I was injured in the accident have broken bones severe brusing and took an ambulance ride and visited several orthopedic surgeons and have appointments with more in future for follow ups. Some of the bills are coming in now from the incident and are already over $8000 dollars. My question is my health insurance already paid an amount of it and say I only owe a portion of the total billed typical health insurance stuff, but the insurance is asking for the total, am I suppose to give them the total billed? The total left? The total I owe plus insurance paid or what? And if it's the total billed what happens with the leftover difference?

Second question do insurance companies pay out for pain and suffering without a lawyer or do I need to retain one? So far they only agreed to all medical bills, car and wage reimbursement though none of that has been finalized and is only a verbal agreement. 

Any insight would be great sorry if scattered first wreck I've been involved in
Thanks!"
68,68,Neighbor telling cops false information leading to possible harassment.," My neighbor is a redneck with his own business that takes way too much interest in my life and what goes on at my house. Sometimes it's good, if someone were to break in hedfire a gun over their heads. Other times it's bad, like recently.  We found a crossbow bolt on our property.  My bf went to the neighbors wife looking for neighbor,  he wasn't around so bf told her about the bolt, asked that if they lose an arrow to pick it up cause our dogs walk there. Neighbor comes down yelling wearing his sidearm  asking what my bf said to upset his wife, then went off on a barrage of insults culminating in him saying my bf is a dope dealer and he has video of him taking bags of drugs down the driveway to cars with out of state tags. That the cops are watching our house, taking pictures of all the tags and running background checks on the owners. Basically he says the cops are looking for any excuse to nail him (he had a warrant for child support he hid from for awhile), and the whole neighborhood knows he's a dope dealer and want him gone. We're older punk rockers and our friends are 2 train kids that come by and pick up my bf (he doesn't drive) all of them excluding my bf have medical cards as do I,  also my bf is an alcoholic  and my neighbor accused him of selling heroin. All this is very unsettling,  I own my home and don't want to move, my bf is afraid the neighbor is going to find a way to send him to jail or burn our house down, he's become very paranoid and feels unsafe here. But, my neighbor is all buddy buddy with cops and we're in a small town. So I don't think going to them would do any good. What can we do on a budget, we're pretty broke."
69,69,Can my sister get her belongings even if the owner of the house says no but my sister had lived there a year?,"So my sister just broke the news she wanted to divorce her husband. They are living with the husbands parents and have been living there for a year. During the breakup tonight my sister wanted to just get her belongings and leave but the mother refused and told her to leave. But the ex husband didn’t want her to leave and smashed my sisters phone on the ground while doing that.
Eventually my sister left and said she will be back for her things tomorrow. If we involve the police can my sister get her belongings or would they tell us to just leave? 
If the ex husband is there being unruly or seems very prone to breaking something of my sisters will the police take that seriously?"
70,70,Unclaimed money; TN RESIDENT MINORS,"So my children are minors when their grandparents  died  2  if them  weren’t born yet my ex was in the obituary and  then it just says 10 grand children and the other siblings I have no contact with his family and barley talk to him. I got mail him for the deceased, and it was one of those unclaimed properties flyers. It’s over 4K on their website it shows the decedents death certificate or obituary documents will be needed , I can get both of their obituaries but since my children are the only ones claiming I know I will need a copy of my exes state ID but he lives out of state. Only my address was only the papers and I wasn’t in the documents how would I claim it? I’m or would they make me wait for everyone to claim? ALSO these people have been dead since 08-and 11 and I’m constantly getting mail and taking to their dad he doesn’t open it he throws it away. 🤦🏻‍♀️ A LIFE INSURANCE CHECK FOR 4500 that would pay for his child’s braces YALL."
71,71,"Dad was victim of check washing $28k made out to the IRS in July 2022, didn't realize until January 2023 and the bank is not covering."," 

He filed a police report, filed an incident with the Post Office where the check went missing as soon as they found out in January but have not gotten any updates. He didn't realize for as long as he did because the money was taken out of the account so he thought that was the IRS receiving the payment. 

Since it has been more than 30 days, the institution where the check was cashed will not reimburse his bank, so my dad's bank will not reimburse him\* either.

He owned a small specialty garage which was just himself + 2 employees where he was the shop master doing the bulk of the hands-on work himself. He is gutted, he has to pull the missing money from his retirement because of this. He worked hard his whole life and to be swindled for such a large amount of money (to us this is huge) is devastating

No word from the police, or the post office but there have been stolen and washed checks frequently in our city over the past few years and it seems clear to many that the problem is coming from within the post office itself.

We were hoping that since it's a check made out specifically to the federal government it would be considered a felony investigation that would be taken very seriously, but have received no traction on an investigation whatsoever.

Now that the bank has chosen not to reimburse him, what are his options? I saw a previous thread where someone suggested filing a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He is looking into that currently, but does anybody have any other advice surrounding strategies or even small things he needs to do? ."
72,72,"Harassment has stopped, but do I still have a case?","A super weird incident happened recently. This guy that’s super pro-gun control (not making a value judgment- it is relevant to the content of the communications) started arguing with a friend of mine over instagram. My friend, “Paul” is very pro-second amendment and makes his stance known loud & proud, especially after big-news mass shootings. The other guy, “Dirk” didn’t like what Paul had to say following a mass shooting and started messaging him just a bunch of facts and statistics about gun violence, coupled with his opinions, arguments and like open ended questions? Paul blocked Dirk on instagram but then Dirk began harassing Paul via text (they used to be coworkers) with more gun-control stuff and like a weird, reverse threat? Dirk seemed to channel Ghandi or MLK and told Paul that if Paul wished to get physical, he would drop to a “submissive” posture and said he wouldn’t fight back, he’ll be defenseless and that Paul can attack him if he wants to. Paul then blocks Dirk’s number, but Dirk started using another phone to continue harassment. 

So, after this guy Dirk sends my friend texts from another phone number, Paul told me about it and I got curious of who it was. I then visited Dirk’s instagram account and watched his “story” posts a few times. If you are unfamiliar with the feature, basically this guy can see that I watched it. It shows a list of people who have viewed it. I do not follow Dirk and he does not follow me. I guess after he noticed I was watching his stories, he sent me a message directed for Paul with more gun-control stuff and like an insult about Paul’s intelligence a couple times. No direct threats. I told him to stop and then he began mocking me, telling me to block him. I felt that since he kept going after I told him to stop, he was for sure harassing me. So rather than block him, I wanted to see how much he would send after I told him to stop. He kept going. He started sending long messages in Chinese characters. More gun-control stuff. And eventually he kept mocking me for not blocking him. He was condescendingly explaining how blocking someone works. He sent a picture of the block option and said “just click it and I’ll go away.” He kept making fun of me for asking him to stop instead of blocking him. Eventually, he kept spamming the call feature on Instagram I guess to annoy me. I would ignore the call but it would just start up again. 

So after this had gone on for an hour or two, he visited my art/business page that I have linked to my personal profile and spammed comments on those posts with some “embarrassing” information he had on Paul that kinda makes Paul out to be a creepy guy or something, I’m not sure if it’s true. But anyway, finally I blocked him because I don’t need that particular page infested with weird comments. I blocked him on my original personal account as well. 



It’s been about a week and a half and he hasn’t contacted myself or Paul since then. We were wondering if we still have legal options for the harassment he did engage in? I asked him to stop and he didn’t and he also contacted Paul after he knew he was blocked. 

People are saying we don’t have a case unless his texts were threatening in nature or if it was continuing. But what do you guys think? Is it possible to take legal action against Dirk for the harassment we have confirmed and documented?"
73,73,Deceased Father With Child Support,"My Dad passed away but my mom is living. I never met him, but I met the family during the funeral. the court ordered him to provide child support. In nearly 18 years of my life he hasn’t given her the money. She’s currently re-filing the support papers, I just want to know where it will come from, if it does come at all ? Social Security ? His estate ? Or living members of the family ? I’m sure I missed some spots here and there so feel free to ask me questions as well for more context."
74,74,Can I sue the state for contaminating my drinking water with PFOA chemicals and causing my property to plummet in value? (Alaska),"I own land directly adjacent to my local airport (small town Alaska that isn't on the road network). We've had title to this land for decades, almost since statehood (we're indigenous Alaskan). When we got title, the ""airport"" was literally no more than a dirt field for bush planes to land on, no buildings, no gas, etc. Today the airport is a much bigger operation and small commercial jets come in and out, which means refueling and deicing services have been added. 

About a decade ago my family developed the land and there are now 2 single family homes (both occupied by my extended family) as well as a 4 unit apartment building. About a year ago we discovered that the airport operations had contaminated our groundwater with PFOA chemicals. As we are on a well (everyone here is on a well and septic), this is also our drinking water. The state has been providing free bottled water since this was discovered. We are now looking to sell the land, but of course, the contamination had greatly reduced its market value. The airport is owned and operated by the state. 

I know it's generally hard to sue the state but that is possible in certain circumstances. In a case like this, is it possible to either sue the state for the lost value or to have them just buy the property outright at its pre-contamination value?"
75,75,Wife may not return to US with children after extended stay in UK.," Im (M41) British/Australian. I live in the Los Angeles with my British/Australian wife F42). 

I’m on the EB2 Green Card with the intention of getting citizenship. 

We have two children, a boy (4) and girl (7) born in Portland.

In 2018, we moved to LA as I was starting a business. The plan was to stay there, or, if the business failed, to move back to Portland. 

The business started well, but got stifled by the pandemic somewhat, and then I became addicted to prescription medication. 

In early November 2022 it was agreed that I got to rehab in the UK, the kids get homeschooled and we spend a few months in the UK. 

The plan was always to return to the USA. This is important because my whole career is in the USA, our house is in the USA, and the children’s school and friend network is in the USA. 

I wasn’t exactly thinking straight at the time, but I did question why so much of our stuff was being sold IF we were going to return. However I was assured I was being paranoid and it was agreed that a lot of our items should be put in storage. 

In addition, we have two cats we’re paying for a couple to look after while away. 

I completed rehab and have remained completely clean. I’ve been going to NA, and my wife and her family (plus friends etc) have remarked on the change in me. In many we’ve we’re closer than ever. 

I even spent a month on my own in LA in February with work, and attended meetings and kept clean. 

We’ve been staying at my wife’s house in the middle of the countryside. It’s incredibly boring and remote, but my wife wanted time to reconnect. 

However, a week into rehab, it was decided (not with me involved) that the kids should attend a local school as they wouldn’t be socialized at home. Again, this was ‘just a few months. 

And now, my wife is making comments about not returning. Just last night, over absolutely nothing, she spat out that ‘she wish she’d never helped me, because now she’s torn between her family not wanting her to return, and me’. 

Her family spend half a year about 12 hours away in their second home. She has a sister locally, but that’s it. I have no family locally, no means of working, not network or career here. I’ve been out of the country for 18 years. 

My wife has now suggested I go back and get work, and they’ll join. My intuition tells me this isn’t true. She’s not exactly great at having difficult discussions, and I suspect when I ‘m over there, she’ll not join. 

Can she do this? I feel like I was given literally one opportunity to get better, and have gladly taken it, I’m unbelievably close to my kids and just feel like I’ve been duped. I’ve looked into work here and there is nothing (otherwise I would at least have spent the past few months working here), instead I’ve been languishing in the countryside. 

To be clear, there was absolutely NO agreement on my side to move the kids permanently. 

I have texts to prove what the plan was. I have texts to prove how much my wife thinks I’ve recovered. I have evidence that our life is still very much in the States. 

Plus the kids hate being in the countryside as all their toys etc are in storage. 

Obviously, if my wife wants out, that's okay. It's no doubt been a tough ride and I'll understand, but if so, I'll have to stay here because of the kids. The intention was always to stay in the US, I have no career, network, plus my Green Card will lapse. Do I have any options here?"
76,76,Got rear ended and now worried their insurance won't pay for my damages bc of the report,"I got rear ended in the state of IN. It was a green light and the car infront of me went straight ahead. I slowly pulled up with my light signal to the intersection to make a right turn and came to a complete stop bc there were pedestrians crossing from both directions. One walking and one on a Lime scooter. The car behind admitted to being on the phone and didn't see me stop bc of the pedestrians. We Exchanged info and made a call to the police for a report. Police showed up and we tell them the same thing pretty much. I was stopped waiting to make a right hand turn bc I was waiting for the pedestrians to cross.
I get the report back and this cop had put down (along the lines of) that I made a sudden stop bc someone on a scooter suddenly crossed.  
I have a strong inclination to believe the officer HATES ppl who ride those scooters, as he made it well known to us after we told our versions. He said ""their the vain on my existence..."" and ""I wish I could get rid of them"" 

I am now worried their insurance will not cover it my damages Bc of the wording that the cop used.
He really took off with a whole different narrative and it concerns me.

Anyone have experience with this?"
77,77,"Moving states, keeping home state residency?","I moved from my home state of Texas to Florida for a job. This is only a temporary move of about a year and a half. I will be returning back to my home state after said timeframe. Since I’m not planning on being a Florida resident, but I will be in the state for longer than the 183 residency days, would I be required to switch over my car registration and license? 

I’ve tried googling this but all information I get is people moving from a income tax state or out of state university students. Since I’m not a student and Texas is also a no income state, none of that applies to me. 

I’ll switch over my stuff if deemed necessary, but I’d rather not if I know with 100% certainty that I’ll be going back."
78,78,Repairs,I’ve been waiting on repairs to my property since east knock bought it last summer. Now I’m down from 2 bathrooms to 1 my house trips breakers every other day due to  half done work. I have mold in my bathrooms you won’t pay to have repairs done on with my repair fund the “repair team vp” told me it wasn’t in the budget. They sent a plumber out because water was coming up from the toilet line in my hall bathroom I’ve never seen another plumber and that’s been since 4/5/2022. When I tell you if you’re thinking about it don’t. I regret it and I’m stuck. I’m a single mom of 3 kids I can’t afford to buy another home I owned this one free and clear and I did this to try and get out of debt. and instead I’ll never be able to buy my home back. The repairs had to be done by 11/08/22  and they haven’t been. so can I sue an get my home back? because if I’m going to have to fix it out of my pocket anyway I’d rather not have to pay them almost 1600 for it; EDIT TO ADD- I have 5 years on a lease here they can raise the rent whenever. And the price on the home will go up 13% every quarter. Right now to buy it back with the issues it’s 138k. I live in TN when I ask when they will be coming I get told I have to speak to my manager
79,79,"A former friend lied to police, I went to jail","A former friend of mine lied to the police claiming that I contacted her employer, resulting in her termination. I never made such an action, and she admitted online that her coworkers ""narced"" on her.

Following this, I was arrested and spent a few hours in jail until my family posted bail. Sitting in the booking/bail area of the jail was extremely distressing to me, between fear of unethical COs, abusive inmates, denial of healthcare; and what if my family couldn't post my bail. My emotional health continued to worsen between being released on bail and my hearing because I was convinced my life was over; I came close to admitting myself to short term behavioral health treatment.

I'm not sure what happened on the prosecution side but I think charges were dropped because nothing happened during my arraignment (compared to others having their charges read, public defenders offered, and so on). Even after my hearing, I struggle with my mental health due to the trauma this situation has caused.

So, I am wondering if I'd have any grounds to press charges against the former friend for the severe emotional distress she caused me, including her knowingly lying to the police, my being booked in jail (which her friends enjoyed hearing about, at my expense), and questioning my freedom.

If I do have any standing, how could I proceed? I'm well below the poverty line due to my mental disabilities."
80,80,[US - WA] advice: collections case filed against me but haven’t received summons,"Hey smart folks — seeking advice on how to best resolve the situation I find myself in. Throwaway, because I’ve been freaking out for the past few hours and feeling paranoid. 

Overly-long backstory, short: I’ve fallen into delinquency with a major credit card provider in the last 8 months due to a combination of unexpected income shifts and poor coping skills surrounding anxiety and depression. No excuses, I know it’s my fault. 

—

So, why I’m here: I know very clearly I’ve fucked up by ignoring debt I couldn’t pay over the last 6+ months. I just ignored / avoided everything (emails, calls, snail mail) because I wasn’t willing to face it. Thanks to treatment and (attempts at) regular exercise, I had a burst of motivation today to start getting on the right track. I pulled my credit report found out I had an account in collections with what looked like a law firm. I’m sure they’ve called and/or sent mail I haven’t answered or seen, but it made me worried enough to check court records for my name. 

As it turns out, there was a commercial complaint case filed against me at the end of February, which is rather terrifying. I can’t see much information online, beyond that it was marked “archived, no docket info,” has a document list I can’t see the contents of, and has a trial date in 2024. 

I’ve torn through my mile-high stack of unopened mail and flipped through recent memory, but I don’t believe I’ve received any summons regarding the case. I’m terrified that I have some legal obligation to respond, but I don’t have anything to respond to. 

Any advice on the best course of action? I frankly can’t afford a lawyer for at least a month, at which point I will get a bit of cash from a stock sale. I’m trying to do the right thing here, but I’m fully aware I’m out of my depth, and worry that anything I say/do will stack the deck against me. 

Apologies if this isn’t the right kind of question for y’all; alternatively, thank you in advance for your thought!

Edit: one final/random question that just occurred to me: is it worth contacting the creditor to work out resolving the debt? They are name in the suit, so I don’t believe they have sold the debt to a third party. But, I’m also not sure if such an action in irrelevant at this point given they’ve hired attorneys."

She called him and texted a few times for him to stop contact. 
This dude is flipping out now, making threats to kill me the most alarming text reads as follows 

“give me this guy’s number. Also his name and address if he knows I know how to find him he will back off This shit stops now I’ll hunt him down like a fucking dog and he better pray I never find him it’s ok you told me where he lives if he hurts you he’s a fucking dead man I will not stop until he’s delt with” 

There are several emails and texts with death threats to me included, he sent a string of probably 10 emails this afternoon, after he was asked to stop contacting her. Many of which include threats of physical harm and death.
 
Another reads 

“I live in the one of the most conservative cities in the country lighting up psychos is no big deal” he also mentions his “bennilli 12 gauge” again, never not once spoken to this guy. And again, probably more than a dozen threats of violence and death in the span of 12 hours.

So restraining order? Is this violating any “threat” laws? It also is across state lines, tx and az"
83,83,Lienholder refusing to remove lien on car?,"Okay, please forgive my explanation of this. I haven’t dealt with this sort of thing before. 

Also, this is in Virginia. 

My fiancé’s mother is in rough shape physically and has decided to gift her car, a 2003 Toyota Camry, to my fiancé. It has more sentimental value than anything, but my fiancé could definitely use a working car. 

Prior to MIL having the car, it belonged to her brother. They apparently worked out an arrangement where MIL made payments on car. It was registered in MIL’s name, she had insurance on it, she drove it, whole 9 yards. But apparently he had placed a lien on it to ensure payment. 

MIL successfully paid car off a year, possibly longer ago. Her brother sent her the title and a form releasing the lien, but MIL lost them both. 

So here we are, trying to get a replacement title from the DMV today, and there’s still an active lien on the car. They said all they need is a handwritten letter from the lienholder saying it’s released, which sounds simple. 

The problem is, dude doesn’t want my fiancé to have the car. Their family is like this, and dude will actively fight her getting the car just out of spite. 

Since the car is paid for, can DMV force him to release it? What does that look like? This car likely isn’t worth lawyering up over. I asked DMV and the lady didn’t really know. I fear MIL - who is low income and not the brightest - likely has no way of proving she ever made payments. 

What’s my next step here?

Thank y’all in advance."
84,84,Legal question,State is Pennsylvania. I have an autistic son he is 3 years old (non verbal) and today while he’s at daycare his mom gets a call from a police officer saying our son was found outside about half a block away from his daycare by a lady working at one of the offices in that area she called said he was putting rocks in his mouth she went to pick him up to bring him inside and he ran into the street she had to chase him. Afterwards he had to go to the hospital for X-rays to make sure he didn’t eat any rocks there was a police report filed and an investigation open with the state he was given a clean bill of health and released.

85,85,I requested an exterminator for a mouse outbreak. Eleven days later and no exterminator has come and my landlord has sent notice that my apartment has unsanitary living conditions.,"I am a current student at university and have lived in my apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the past year and a half. Last week, I was doing work in my living space when a mouse crawled under my door and run into my kitchen. I put in a maintenance request that day requesting an exterminator. I am deeply afraid of mice and have been avoiding my kitchen at all cost because that is where the mouse tends to live. 

A maintenance man showed up the next day asking where the dead mouse was and I stated that I needed someone to remove the mouse living in my kitchen. He looked around and told me that the exterminator only comes to the building one day a week and that he had just come the day prior so I had to wait a week for the exterminator. 

In the mean time, I purchased a few hundred dollars worth of mice removal equipment and pet control items for my apartment. I waited a week for the exterminator to come on the day that the maintenance man said the exterminator would come but they no showed. Due to my university schedule, I was home until 3:00pm when I left my only class of the day (which started at 3:30) began.

The next day, I called my apartment complex  when I saw the mouse again and explained that the mouse was still there. I explained that the exterminator never showed like was promised and they said they would send someone my way. 

I was breaking down large boxes when a maintenance man showed up at my door. I had left my boxes next to my sofa and the trash bags, full of items the mouse got into the night prior that I had just finished cleaning up, along the wall next to the boxes.  The maintenance man asked where the dead mouse was again and I told him that the mouse was still alive hiding in my kitchen. He asked to come in and I let him in again. He looked at my boxes and said that those were good hiding spots for mice to hide in and I told him that I was just breaking them down when he arrived. 

He then entered the kitchen (which I have refused to enter for the past week) to see if there were any holes in the walls that the mouse was using as a hiding spot. I explained to him that the mouse had crawled threw my front door to enter my apartment so he left to get something to prevent the mouse from entering my apartment that way in the future. He told me he would only be gone a couple of minutes but ended up being gone for 40 minutes. By the time he has come back, I needed to get to class so I left him in my apartment to do whatever he needed to do.

Later in the day, I get an email stating that due to ""undisposed garbage, boxes along the floor, and moldy food left in the kitchen sink and oven"" I was going to be expecting a surprise visit from my landlord to inspect the property. I went into my kitchen and did see dishes in my sink I needed to wash but there was no mold on any plates nor was there any food or mold in my oven.

I have since cleaned up the boxes and trash bags but what can I do to get them to send an exterminator? Could this be something they can evict me for?"

88,88,Small business not giving tips,"Hi so I am in the training period at a small business in Ventura county and I’m a barista. They have this system in place where you go through the “training” period and after you graduate you receive 50% of the tips in the tip pool and then when you graduate from that and show you are a leader you get 100% of the tips. 

My question is I’ve been at the training period for 2 months at this point because the test to pass literally is extremely hard and you have to memorize A LOT of shit. I’m getting minimum wage and 0% of the credit card tips through the iPad, which is 99% of tips. I get a super small portion of cash tips that amount to basically nothing. But is this legal because I’ve missed out on $600 in tips because of this dumb system. 

Any help is super appreciated thank you!"
89,89,Got Into Car Accident With Expired License,"I feel like such an idiot. I've been so busy with classes I haven't really been checking my mail. I got into a pretty gnarly accident today. It was definitely not my fault. There was nothing I could do to avoid this accident- I was driving at a normal speed on a road and someone pulled out of a parking lot when I suppose they didn't see me. I was able to brake and swerve into the turn lane, but they still hit me in on the passenger side of my car. So I think it was fairly easy for police (and insurance I hope) to see it wasn't my fault as I was driving on the road and hit in the side from someone exiting a parking lot (or possibly a small road with a stop sign.) Don't worry- everyone was okay. Her car didn't even suffer too much damage, but mine is pretty gnarly on the side but at least I was able to drive it home. I doubt either passenger side door open though nor do I think the windows will roll down- it was pretty bad.

The car is pretty crushed on the passenger side, and I'm very concerned about insurance since looks like my license is a little expired. A little over a month.

I called the police and the other driver and I exchanged info. The police came by and got my info, and I also gave it over the phone. The police didn't notice my license was a little expired at the time.

Obviously I made an appointment at Sec of State Monday to get it renewed. I'm so worried now- are the police going to cite me or do they give you a little bit of a grace period? **Will insurance try to not pay?** This is what I am most concerned about. Is anyone even really going to notice though? I'm so worried about this.

I live in Michigan if it matters."

91,91,Can I ask the landlord to evict our roommate or take her off the lease?,"Okay so me and my boyfriend moved into our first place together with 2 of our friends. At the time we thought it was a good idea, and roommate 1 is fantastic we lived with her for a few weeks before roommate 2 moved in. However roommate 2 is constantly complaining over every little thing, lazy (not doing chores as simple as dishes but complaining when the dishes arent clean her dishes exactly) being somewhat manipulative , and everyone in the house regrets moving in with roommate 2 and its only been one month. However roommate 2 is on the lease as a tenant like the rest of us, and I'm pregnant so all this stress isn't good for my baby. Is there any legal way for us and our landlord to get her off the lease as a tenant or evicted so our household can live together in peace again like before she moved in?"
92,92,Lash lift and tint service damaged my eyes and salon refusing to refund unless I sign a commercial release,"I’m pasting my google review as it best explains the situation. 

Do I have any legal entitlement to compensation? FYI the lady who did the service may not have been fully licensed yet 

I have been getting waxing and facial services at this salon since they began offering them at the end of last year. Each facial and waxing treatment I received has been outstanding.

A month ago, following my waxing and facial service, I decided to try a lash lift and tint service for the first time, 2 days before my vacation.

Unfortunately, it caused an awful antibacterial resistant double eye infection. I remember the chemicals burning my eyes when they were tugged open during the treatment. The following evening my eyes were completely red, painful, itchy and producing a ton of discharge. It damaged my eyes and left me with an excruciatingly painful infection. It felt like I was blinking through gravel and shards of glass. Every second, all I could think about was the pain through each blink. The ibuprofen and Tylenol rounds only helped take the edge off for a couple of hours and I would count down the minutes until my next dose. I couldn’t wear my contacts so I had to use only my glasses, meaning I couldn’t go in the sun or swim with my daughter on our beach vacation. I was prescribed two antibacterial drops by my doctor at home the day before I left. After using them as prescribed for 3 days, the condition only worsened and my vision blurred.

I had to seek medical care overseas and was referred to a specialist to which I had to travel to the main city to see. This was a whole day of travel on the day of a family wedding and a very expensive taxi ride and doctor/medicine fees. I also had to buy prescription sunglasses so I could both see and protect my eyes from the sun. It was a painful, scary and expensive ordeal.

This was almost a month ago and my eyes are still messed up. I can’t wear my contacts or makeup. The infection won’t fully subside and I’m having other side effects from the prolonged use of antibiotic drops and steroids. I am waiting to see a specialist here at home.

I asked for a refund for the lash lift and tint service. $65. In the form of a credit to my next waxing or facial service.

It’s standard business practice to offer a refund or at least a credit to your customers when a procedure goes wrong, yields poor results, or in my case damages your eyeballs.

I don’t hold it against the service provider at all. I know her. She’s amazing and so talented at waxing and facials. But something went wrong during the lash procedure and I’m still dealing with the effects today. It’s been scary, painful, uncomfortable and expensive. So at the very least I would expect a business to handle this with a “how can we make this right” approach and honor my request for offer a refund or credit.

I was told that I would need to complete paperwork and wait for my refund via a cashiers check. That this was “salon policy” even though the policy is not publicly available on their website and I was not informed about this policy at any point.

The paperwork that I’m required to sign in order to get a refund is a legally binding commercial release form which would not only silence me, but put me in legal and financial trouble if I tell anyone about what happened to my eyes verbally or online.

I wasn’t going to share a review or tell anyone about my eyes. In fact, I was still referring my friends there. The fact is that mistakes and accidents happen. Especially with people who are still learning. And there is risk is involved with anything you do.

In the end I decided to share, because they are refusing to give me my money back or offer a credit unless I sign this legally binding document commercial release document which releases them from all liability and puts me at risk.

No thanks. You can keep my $65.

So what I want others to know, and wish I would have known, is
1) The “salon policy” on refunds
2) That they don’t stand behind their services. It’s buyer beware and beautify at your own risk.
3) The serious risks involved with lash services.

I’m so disappointed and shocked. It is such an unethical business practice to put extreme legal contingencies on a refund or credit to which I am 100% entitled."
93,93,What does a bonded title do for resale value?,"Unfortunately I live in a state that requires the seller to notarize their signature on the title.. I inquired with the DMV, notary offices, and the state treasurer’s office: bonded title is my only option since I can’t get a hold of the seller.

94,94,Can I keep my kids from their father? Alberta.,"My ex has 3 children. His oldest (7) is raised by someone other than him and the mom. We have 2 children together (2 and 6 months) I have sole custody of our oldest. I got sole custody when we broke up the first time because he has alcohol and drug issues, he is unreliable and mentally unstable and cannot keep a job. When we are together he is okay, he doesn’t do his full job as a parent but does help when it’s convenient but I would never trust him to take either of my children overnight. 

His oldest has become well known to the parents addict issues and frequently is let down and disappointed but their absence. My ex recently missed our oldest child’s birthday last weekend. He took off from Friday night for 6 days with absolutely no contact. This is not the first time he has taken off for several days, but he has never missed our kids birthday (given this is only the second birthday) but he has missed their first Halloween, Easter, thanksgiving sort of deal. 

I’m tired of this continuing hurt cycle he inflicts on his oldest, and it’s starting with our oldest and I’m worried my children will grow up always hurting. In a legal sense, what can I do? I know cutting complete contact can be messy and toxic but I want to prevent my children from living this life comfortably the way his oldest does. I am in Alberta, Canada."
95,95,Is this enough for a restraining order?,"So my roommate smokes weed in my house against our agreement - not anti 420 just have kids in my home and therefore take it outside. He will not stop despite the arrangement of an outdoor location for him. He brings different women over all the time - who walk around my children without clothing. I need him out now!! and to top it all off, he brought an illegal loaded gun to my property - in his car, yes. but the real kicker is he gave access to it to someone with an active no violent contact order protecting me from them. So he just armed him. Someone who has threatened my life on multiple occasions. Is this ground for a restraining order against my roommate or quick removal?"

98,98,"[Colorado] Paid private seller upfront for motorcycle, I received the title and bill of sale. Now they are not responding.","Hey everyone,

I found a motorcycle on Facebook Marketplace for $2000 in Golden, CO. When speaking with the private seller, we organized a time to meet at his house on February 25th. He showed me the title which shares the same VIN as the motorcycle. I looked up the VIN and verified it’s not stolen. During the showing, the bike was disassembled. The seller said he was customizing the bike, and it would take a couple days to finish. The seller is a mechanic and does this for a living; he showed me a book of other bikes he’s built. Before leaving, I gave him $200 cash as a down payment, and he gave me the title.

A few days go by and the seller mentions the bike will need some more time, and he needs the full $2000. I was leaving town for two weeks, March 1st - 15th, and I was worried he’d sell the bike, so I gave him the full $2000 in cash before leaving. We went into his house, where he had two dogs (important detail for later), and we signed a motor vehicle bill of sale on February 28th. He even wrote on the back of the bill of sale,

“I [seller’s first and last name] promise to finish build on this [Year, Make, model, VIN] and hold until buyer [my first and last name] picks up motorcycle on or before this date 03-18-2023. If motorcycle is not finished or buyer is not happy with end product full refund will be provided. 
[sellers signature]”

I felt like I could trust this guy since I have his phone number, home address, the bike’s title and bill of sale.

When I get back in town, we reconnect and set up a time to meet at my place for him to deliver the bike on March 21st. Around now he’s slow to respond. When the seller eventually picks up my call, he said that a friend was in the hospital, and he was dealing with that. Another two days go by, and he says that the hospitalized friend passed away, another friend committed suicide, and one of his dogs died. He said he’d have the bike delivered by Friday March 24th. Doesn’t happen. We speak again and he said he needed to take a vacation with his wife and daughter over the weekend. Given the events earlier in the week, I said ok, and he said we’d to meet that Tuesday March 28th. 

Since then, I have called him every day, left voicemails, texted him, and sent a Facebook message all with no response. Eventually his phone started going straight to voicemail. On April 1st, I stopped by his place to see if he was ok. A house sitter was there, who said he was out of town until April 10th. I called everyday, again to no response.

Today, April 14th, I went by his place and knocked on the door. I heard only one dog and a baby noise but no one came to the door. I sat in my car about to call for a wellness check, when I get a text from the seller’s wife from his phone. She mentioned he got into a “motorcycle accident and is resting from complications from another surgery. And will make sure he calls me tomorrow.”

With all that context, what should I do?"
99,99,Would this fall under a fair housing violation?,"So I apply to get my assistance animals (cats) approved by my housing provider by sending in all the documents required (care plan, therapist note, ect). I require the assistance animals for two different on going mental health problems. Without them I have problems thriving properly in my everyday life. 
My landlord originally accepted both assistance animals, but a month later requested the removal of one of them under the idea that the documents they gave me (from the landlord) were ""fake"". With this knowledge my therapist resent in all the forms needed to reapprove them. 
The landlord then rejected the approved saying ""I didn't need two"" even though my landlord isn't my health care provider, and that claim would go directly against what my Healthcare provider recommends. 
My landlord then also tried to fine/charge me for having an unapproved pet, being dishonest, and forging a document. The landlord has also in a way threatened me by claiming that I wouldn't be able to overturn her statement as she was an admin of the college and no one would belive my side. 
Do note this is a college setting, but I'm pretty sure in regards to HUD laws they are still required to follow the same laws."
100,100,Yellow lights that turn red halfway through,"I am a new driver and have gone through ten plus yellow lights that turned red when I was past the line and it was too late to stop so I just went through. Additionally there were two instances where I think the light may have turned red before my back wheels were past the line. I'm in Illinois and one of these intersections had a visible camera the other was in an urban empty intersection but there may have still been a camera. 

After finding out that these are all illegal I am just going to stop at yellow lights from now on. In the mean time, this all happened in the past two weeks. Should I expect 12 red light canera tickets in the mail? 2? What are the chances I won't get any tickets? How much are the fines and most importantly will they count towards violations that will suspend my license? I already have an accident on my record that resulted in a ticket and counts as a strike on my driving record. 

I'm freaking out and tried researching these answers but there were not straight answers. 

Thank you."
101,101,My mom is being scammed out of her home of 18 years!,"My disabled mother is being scammed out of her home of 18 years !

In 2005 my mom “purchased” a home with what she understood to be a “co-signer” (my stepsisters husband, we’ll call him G). My mom has lived in the house since & paid every bill & made every mortgage payment. The house is an older build & has been needing major repairs. Mom attempted to have the repairs done & came to the realization that she is no where on any of the house paperwork or the loans for the house. She immediately attempted to contact the G & is told he doesn’t know anything & he doesn’t want anything to do with the house & he was gonna sign it over to my step sister in their divorce & so she could sign it over to my mom. Well the divorce happened. My dad contacted his daughter regarding the house & she pretty much told him to go screw himself, she didn’t want anything to do with him or the house. My parents continued living in the house, continued making the mortgage payments. Continued attempting to make contact with G & my step sister to no avail. Well one of the loans on the house has matured & they’re wanting full payment of the remaining 13k on the loan or they’re threatening foreclosure. My mom became disabled & is on a fixed income. My dad is a migrant field worker & doesn’t make as much because he is elderly, suffers from diabetes & is going blind. My sister & I were able to locate G using social media, public records, google maps & a little detective work. We went to his residence & informed him of the situation & told him we are willing to pay off the remaining balance of both loans all he has to do is sign over the house like he originally agreed. 
He is refusing to sign it over until the ex wife signs. He claims he signed it over in the divorce, but on the divorce decree the property address is incorrect (goes to show how involved they’ve been with the property) & the title is still in his name & only his name. We drove 4 hours to visit my step sister & ask her to sign, well she’s still bitter from her divorce & is demanding half of what the property is worth. I honestly feel they’re gonna screw my mom over for something she’s invested so much into. My parents can’t afford legal help, can’t afford to move & will soon be homeless. Any advice?"
102,102,Father in law issues,"When I got married, I helped my in-law grow his business. As he progressed, I helped him finance a work truck. It’s in my name, but he pays it. The only thing I asked of him was to pay on time. A year later, he’s made several late payments that I had to cover so I wouldn’t have late payments on my credit. He always pays me 1-3 weeks late.  

I can’t continue to cover the truck payment till he catches up because it puts a strain on my finances. He also continues to promise he’ll pay everyday and never does. The constant disappointment over the last year has really taken a toll on me mentally.

Can I just take the truck and sell it? How do I repo it from him? Just take it?"
103,103,Law firm sent a letter threatening to Garnish my wages and sell my Assets Ontario,"Long story short, my mom got into a very bad accident in Pakistan while visiting her mom. I had to urgently send money to cover a life-or-death medical procedure, totaling CDN$9500. To help cover the costs, I borrowed CDN$5000 from Firestone Financial a few months ago, but due to unforeseen circumstances, I have fallen behind on my payments. Recently, a Fairstone representative visited my dad's house (where I currently reside) and presented me with a document from a lawyer demanding payment of $6700, threatening legal action, wage garnishment, and asset seizure if I do not comply. Unfortunately, I am unable to prioritize this payment at the moment, as I have other financial obligations to meet.

A few things to note: I am a 20-year-old dual citizen of the US and Canada, and I work/school in Detroit while currently living in Windsor. I'm pretty sure the CRA does not know about my US income. Can they garnish my wages in the US over 6.7k? The only asset I possess is a 2003 Honda Civic with US plates (Illinois). Would they know the car is mine? And would they be able to seize it? This will get me fired from work and while I intend to pay off the debt eventually, I am unable to do so at this time. I don't need a lecture on morals, as I had no choice but to send the money for my mom's medical procedure and would do so again in a heartbeat, so please, save it for someone else. I just need advice right now

Can y'all help me understand my legal options and potential consequences in this situation if I let it go to court?

104,104,Pawn shop messes up my account and sells my laptop when they shouldn't have.,"Hi, I'm new here and on mobile so not sure how things work. I'm honestly not sure if this belongs here.

Sometime last year I pawned the laptop my ex bought me for valentine's day because I was in a bind and needed food and gas. 
 Two months ago I went to go get it out after paying on it the whole time it was in there. Which was only three months since I try to rotate between my three items. 
 I learned that the day I went to go get it they had sold it because it was apparently past due despite me paying on it the month before. 
 When bringing it up to one of the managers they discovered the account was tampered with and messes up so it showed the laptop over due and able to be sold I assume to the person who messed it up in the first place. 
 They since fired the person but haven't made any attempt to replace the laptop with one they have in stock or give me any money so I can replace it myself. 
 
Some information. The laptop was a gaming laptop an acer predator Helios 3000(I think I can't remember exactly) it was about $1,300-1,400 on Amazon. 
I personally cannot afford that or any other laptop to replace it as I'm on the streets in an rv with no transmission at the moment. And was in the same rv when it was given to me. I also can't afford any lawyers and honestly don't know how to go through that process. 


 I just feel like they should of done something about it since I always go there and pawn with them and almost always gets my stuff out. I've been with them for over 2 years now and know most of the staff. What should I do?"
105,105,My lawyer asked me to review a 60 page insurance policy in order to 'save me money'. Is this common?,"So the short version is I had a contractor who did shoddy work on my home that will cost a 100% refund and then some to fix.  We got a lawyer to help facilitate reimbursement as the contractor was refusing to pay the full amount.  The contractor originally tried to make an insurance claim, but it was closed due to shoddy workmanship not being covered.

Our attorney was given a large binder of pictures, previous communications, and snapshots of the contractor not being appropriately licensed at the time of the job (I know, I should've checked).  He pursued the insurance policy believing that was the best means of financial restitution and got a hold of the policy, which is a 60 page document.  

I have a promotional rate through my employer for the first 25 hours and had them make a note to apprise me of how many hours have been billed.  Our attorney initially was confident that this would be resolved well before those were used up.  So far we're at about 7.  Today he indicated that he was worried about going over 25 hours and that I could save some hours by reviewing the document myself and finding anything pertinent to our case.

Up until this point I've already compiled lots of information and was kind of gobsmacked that  I was being delegated further legal work when all I can tell that's been done is they procured the insurance policy.  The rate goes up considerably after the 25 hours is used up to the point where it's counterintuitive for the size of the claim.  

I was in the process of writing a terse email regarding how I feel like they're just bilking me and that delegating insurance policy review to a non-legal entity seems like an opportunity for a miss.  But this is my first time dealing with a lawyer.  Is this an understandable ask?"

We are in L.A county and the company acquired the build ring from previous company less than a year ago.  Since then they tried to increase our rent to the maximum permites by the local rent control. They are evicting all units rented by previous tenant. New tenants units (around 6) are not being evicted. Is this legal? What can I do? Here is a copy of the signed notice. 

Edit: New tenants are being charged double our rent.

State law permits former tenants to reclaim abandoned personal property left at the former address of the ten subject to certain conditions. You may or may not be able to reclaim property without incurring additional costs, depending on the cost of storing the property and the length of time before it is reclaimed. In general these costs will be lower the sooner you contact your former landlord after being notified that property belonging to you was left behind after you moved out."
109,109,Should I sue my landlord?,"Should I sue my landlord?

The beginning of March our air conditioning unit went out, it was 90 degrees in Texas. It took them two weeks to fix this issue. April 11th at 5 in the morning half of our house lost electricity and our air conditioning unit lost a leg of a power (brand new unit) so now we are going on five days of no electricity. We put in a service request promptly and have sent photos of our thermostat. It is currently reading 79 degrees and will be in the 90s this weekend. We have a property management company (mynd management) and I know the landlords name. We also have a toddler so a 90 degree home is not a safe environment.

They sent two electricians out this week who stated this was the homeowners problem because the underground is out. They called me tonight saying it was our issue and to contact Center Point. So we did and they once again confirmed this is the home owners problem. So we wasted the entire day when they could have sent a vendor over to fix it.

Is this grounds to sue or end our lease for unlivable conditions? We pay $3,150 in rent. Our electricity bill has gone up $150 since these issues started and my dryer I believe is also broken due to the electricity issue. 

What can I do to escalate this and have these issues resolved?"

There is a manager on site but my dad checks in about once or twice a week. Having problems with a tenant who hasn’t paid rent in forever.

Without permission, tenant did some brick/cement work on a lot. After it was done, he presented it to my dad and asked for payment (well, tried to barter it into taking off some of the rent he owes). Dad obviously refused, said he never contracted him to do anything, etc. etc. On-site Manager said he had no idea this was done and didn’t notice him doing it to stop him.

A company owns the undeveloped land behind our home. They have an easement to their property that includes our driveway. We are not blocking the owners from accessing their land (which can only be accessed by foot at the end of our driveway). However, they often come without notice and bring big trucks and contractors to do work (not permitted) on their land. 

They’ve asked us multiple times to move our car so they can bring contractors to park in our driveway to do work without notice. We have explained that it’s our driveway and the car is not working so it’s not that we are being difficult, we just can’t move it. 

They said if we don’t move it by next week they’ll tow the car at our own expense. Is this legal? What remedies would we have in Los Angeles if they do tow our own car off our own property? We have tried reasoning with these people but they are very nasty and threatening to us and we’ve tried getting the Sheriff involved in the past but they don’t do anything to help us.

114,114,[CA] Apartment owners charging carpet replacement,"Throwaway.

Hey all. I recently moved out of my large apartment complex about a week ago. I lived there for 1 year and 3 months with my roommate. A large corporation owns this complex if that matters. During a pre inspection, 2 days before move out, we were told to paint some chips on the wall but that was it. During the final inspection we were told on top of covering some minor paint chips in my roommates room, both bedrooms carpets needed to be replaced due to “stains” .. the only reason we didn’t shampoo our carpets was because our carpet shampooer broke down and we didn’t have time to get another. The stains are just from us walking around with shoes on that can be removed with a carpet shampooer like i’ve done many times before in that apartment. 

Per our lease the carpet replacement happens when there is damage and can cost up to $1150. How do I argue that there is not damage without getting a lawyer involved or having to fight this in court? This is ridiculous. My carpet is not damaged and barely even stained. I showed pictures to everyone in the office and the property manager was unwilling to even look, stating if the inspector said there’s damage then there’s damage."

116,116,Did I commit mortgage fraud?,"So my soon-to-be ex husband and I decided to divorce. He was trying to buy a house but couldn’t qualify for a loan on his own, and we still had a joint account open. He asked me to sign a “gift letter” for an amount that was less than what we had in our joint account, and I felt bad for him and signed it. He never withdrew the amount, and closed on his house a year and a half ago.

Finally getting around to doing divorce paperwork, and the divorce has gotten VERY nasty. I’m worried the gift letter will come back to bite me in one of two ways:

-Will he claim that I owe him the money, since he never withdrew it? (He also has never asked me for it or indicated that I owe it to him.)

-If he gets busted for mortgage fraud some day, am I going down with him?

He’s tried to pull every dirty trick in the book to get his hands on the substantial inheritance my grandmother left me, so I don’t put it past him to use this against me somehow. Thank you.

Edit to add: I was trying to keep this from being recognized so didn’t share this detail: the discovery request from his lawyer asks how I “characterize the $X gift”. This could have gone on r/divorce, but thought it would apply to any gift letter situation. 

Really, though, can I report him for mortgage fraud without getting myself in trouble?"

118,118,"Was hit by a car while biking in cross walk, the cop who showed up said I was at fault","In Texas. 

I was riding my bike on a side walk. I approached a crosswalk and there was a car stopped there. They were stopped for a long time. Like they had plenty of time to go before i entered the street. Because they didn’t go I assumed that the car was waiting for me to pass- I could not see into the windshield. 

Well turns out (witness account), that she was on her phone. That’s why she was stopped for so long. She accelerated without looking up from her phone and hit me with her SUV. She didn’t brake until her big ass car body slammed the ever living shit out of me. She was accelerating to turn into a highway feeder road with a 60mph speed limit. 

I broke my collarbone and busted my face open. She got out of the car saying “I’m so sorry I’m so sorry” freaking out and I could see she was on the phone with 911 already. I was like immediately high on my own adrenaline and was super calm. 

When the cop showed up he took my statement and stated in the police report that I was the at fault party and that I didn’t take an ambulance to the hospital. (When he showed up I was so out of it I didn’t even realize I had a broken bone and eventually the paramedics convinced me to go with them to the hospital)

121,121,"Boss Says I Should Take All Conversations With Dangerous/Loud/Mentally Ill People Outside Of The Store (California, USA)","Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out if my boss is asking me to do something that is illegal or not.

I work in a very dangerous area with lots of mentally ill, homeless, and drug addicted people.

Sometimes they come into the store I work at and yell, ask me to call them an ambulance, let them use the restroom, or just give them some masks or other stuff. Other times they just want a place to sit for a bit and will get aggressive if you talk to them and ask them to leave.

Once a man came in and he was yelling and raising his voice when lots of customers were around. I was busy and my coworker asked our boss to come out of the back so we could just have power in numbers.

Boss came out, talked with the man for about 5 minutes and then convinced him to leave.

My boss said next time my coworker and I are empowered to handle these situations on our own and we should take it outside so we don’t disturb the customers.

My coworker and I are both small people who have been threatened by homeless people in the area before, and do not feel comfortable asking potentially dangerous people to continue the discussion outside of the safety of the store. Also to me that sounds like an invitation to fight.

Let’s say I listened to my boss, took the person outside, and they injured me. (Knifes have been pulled outside the store before.) could I sue the company for my boss telling me to take it outside?

Also I am already talking to my company’s HR department about other things this boss has done, so I’d like to know if this borders on illegal and if yes, then I will mention it to HR as well.

I would appreciate any help and responses. Thank you.

(P.S. in case this sounds stupid I am very sorry. I have a learning disability so some things that are obvious to others may not be to me.)"

123,123,"Did I get screwed over by my family member? Car I was making payments on got totaled, I got only a portion of the payout I think I should have gotten (long post)","Hi all, TLDR at the end.

I need a bit of advice on judging this situation because honestly, I am not sure what I got myself into with my family member. I am feeling as if I got screwed over or perhaps handed the short end of a stick. Then again I am completely new to how all this stuff works with car buying. Please be gentle with me as I am aware I have limited knowledge and I could have made a huge mistake here.

Background:

A couple years ago, my aunt offered to sell me her vehicle which was a 2011 Infiniti EX35 for a very big 'family discount' of sorts. It had 175k miles on it but at the time I just needed a car so I thought, eh, I'll take it. She was planning to trade it in when she went to buy a new vehicle but decided it might be good to sell it to me since I was in need. We agreed in a text message that I would just pay her $150 a month for 24 months (total price $3600) with no interest or anything of that sort. After the 24 months, she would transfer the title to me. Maybe this is where I went wrong first, but I dunno. I trusted her very much. I am beyond grateful for the deal I got cut on this...at least until now (I will get to it soon).

I drove the car ever since I made the first payment and I have never missed a payment. There was no official contract of sorts, I just made sure I Venmo'ed her what was required every month. The entire time I drove the car, I was expected to pay for all the regular maintenance and also repairs such as the engine. I also bought new things such as a new set of tires and a battery as well. I didn't buy comprehensive insurance on it because I wasn't planning on needing it. I did pay for liability insurance on it though.

&#x200B;

Problem now:

Things were going well until the end of January this year when I got hit by someone at a stop sign. The accident was not my fault, so my insurance did not take liability for it and the other person's insurance had to pay for all the damages. Well, it turns out, the repairs exceeded the value of the car so the car was deemed a total loss and the other person's insurance paid out $8000 to the title holder, my aunt.

Now... This is where I have an uneasy feeling.

During this time, I began to look for another used car to buy and she told me she would help me pay for another rental after the insurance rental ran out, plus use ""some"" of the money on the downpayment for my next car. Of course, because she had to spend some on the rental. At this time, I only owed her 5 more months of the payments ($750 total) but she said I didn't need to pay that to her. I figured she would have just taken the $750 out of the $8000 she got paid, and then given the rest of the money to me. At least, this is how I came to understand that a normal lien situation would play out if I owed money to someone and the car got totaled. But she sent me only $1500 and when I asked where the rest was, she was confused why I expected that I was going to get the full amount. I didn't expect to get the full $8000, I really only thought I would get $5600 or so, because of the money I still owed her PLUS what she spent on my rental. She seemed upset that I thought I was supposed to get the money from the car being totaled.

In the end, she gained $2850 from me over the past months PLUS the $4900 leftover from the insurance payout after she paid me $1500 and $1600 my rental. I feel that she profited more off of this situation. I am a bit frustrated that the full money that should have been paid out to me (if only I had 5 months more time to get the title in my hand before getting in a wreck) is going to her even though she did not sell it to me for $7750 or more. She was selling it to me for $3600.

I am a complete noob in this situation and quite frankly, I am not sure who is being unfair here. I do feel as though I have a right to the 8000 minus 750 I owed, minus 1600 for rental car. But I only got a small cut of 1500. I didn't want to cause discourse between us but I do want to voice my concern to her if she is being unfair. Since I'm a bit clueless about how this would work normally, maybe I am wrong?

Any advice or input before I start spouting nonsense toward her would be very much appreciated. I would love to know what your thoughts are.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My aunt offered to sell me a car at a family discount and she would transfer the title to me when I finished paying a total of $3600 over 2 years. I just paid $150 through Venmo on-time every month. I also paid for all the maintenance on the car + liability insurance. 5 months before my last payment, another car hit me and totaled the car. The title was still in my aunt's name, she got an $8000 payout from the other driver's insurance. I expected she could keep $750 of the payout because that is all I owed her now. Instead, she took $4900 for herself and she only gave me $1500 + we spent $1600 on a rental for me. She was upset when I asked her where the rest was, so I left it alone for a bit. I am feeling a bit cheated because I expected that she would only take $750 cause that's all I owed her. But also this could have been completely my fault for agreeing to this kind of payment to my aunt with no legal contracts/loans or anything. Before I confront her, did I misunderstand something here? Is there nothing I can really argue about because there is not much in writing? Please be gentle with me as I am very much a noob in this situation & I really just depended on my aunt's word for all of this deal. I appreciate all advice & input."

Hey all,


I think I am being target for discrimination and potentially ADA violation. I work from home.


I have an accommodation on file for frequent restroom breaks due to the medication. I just wanted to have this on file to avoid any conversations that come up regarding bathroom usage.

I am required to write down the time I leave and return from the bathroom and provide it to my manager at the end of the day. 

My bathroom breaks aren’t excessive I mainly go once an hour for 5 - 7 minutes. 

My manager is on leave and currently reporting to a new manager for the time being. Since then they have put my bathroom breaks as unpaid time on my schedule. Up until this point all my bathroom breaks have been paid and we’re solely used for tracking purposes for my schedule. 

I reached out to the accommodations agent and they advised that ADA breaks protect time off and are not wage replacement.

My original approval letter did not specify that bathroom breaks would be unpaid and they never mentioned it before. 

None of my other coworkers have to report their restroom breaks and I didn’t either before I had an accommodation.

Is this illegal? It doesn’t feel right. Please let me know how I should handle. Thank you all!"

Recently I was sent a letter by a law firm representing the management company and the apartment complex stating that I am being held liable for more than $400,000 in damages. I had renters insurance up to $100,000 liability. I am wondering what are next steps for me. I have yet to call the insurance adjustor for the claim about it as I just got the papers today. Will I be held liable to pay whatever my renter's insurance doesn't pay? I was led to believe at the time by the apartment complex people after the fire that the renters insurance would cover up to the max liability and then their insurance would kick in and cover what was left over. So now I am being blindsided by these papers that I have received. All I had was verbal confirmation that I was going to be in the clear and wasn't going to be held liable for any of the damages.

The primary symptoms are a stiffening of soft tissues, intermittent decreased mobility, fatigue, general inflammation, pain. The diagnosis is likely degenerative, and may worsen with time (possible future outcome/worst case scenario is inability to move most or all of A's body, and/or heart failure). A, on the advice of primary care, rheumatology, endocrinology, and naturopathic specialists/doctors, has taken steps to lesson symptoms of this disease including changing diet, trying different supplement and medical protocols, and decreasing their workload. A has not been using FMLA (their employer approved time off without formal FMLA), but has been using one sick day per week and one or two work from home day(s) per week. A works in a professional job (state gov job, desk job), but finds it difficult to manage symptoms working full time (ie. maximizing rest, exercise, diet). A has put in generous notice (to quit) at their work (about six months), and intends to work long enough to fully train their replacement (ie. end date is flexible). 

Info: A's direct supervisors have been supportive and kind. They have not requested doctor's notes, and are fine with A's modified work schedule. They would love for A to stay, but understand the reasons for leaving. A's job is intended to be fully in-person, and does have functions which can only be done in person. HR at A's work is removed from their department, and supports \~4k admin staff at A's regional office. A works in a small field office, and lives in a rural part of the state (so A may need to travel a great distance to find specific types of legal or medical support).

The question: Can A apply for long term disability through their employer while still employed (likely for 2ish more months given typical hiring timelines)? They work for the state gov, so presumably have good benefits (although sick leave balance is running low). While there is not good information about how long A would be able to sustain working part time, or how quickly their disease is likely to progress... A does not want to spend whatever ""good years"" they have left managing symptoms well enough to work as much as possible (currently 2-3 days per week in office). They would rather manage symptoms to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible. I have heard that is can be very difficult to get disability, even when disability insurance is available, as in A's case. Is there a specific type of attorney that A might contact to request support in documenting/filing for disability? Would A need to completely lose the ability to work before applying for disability, or could their doctors confirm that this disease is degenerative to help with a disability claim? What can A do at this point to pursue a modest disability income, and possibly ongoing medical coverage (such as Medicare) after they leave their employer? If A leaves this job without setting up disability, is it possible to get disability as an unemployed person once the disease progresses?"
137,137,My professor is making assumptions I am procrastinating when I actually just found out I was pregnant and was sent to the hospital. I’m now failing even with medical evidence. Is this discrimination?,"Context: my friend told me this was discrimination. I don’t know if it is. 

I am a good student. I have a 3.8 gpa. In all of my classes I have never been late on an assignment. This professor has us ask our questions in a discussion board instead of emailing him. This way our classmates can help us. 

I was under the impression I was doing something wrong for weeks. I posted my issue in the discussion board multiple times. I went through troubleshooting steps my classmates suggested. Nothing worked. Finally I panicked and emailed him. It was then, after two assignments failed due to this error, he tells me it is a tech error (from a university program) and he tells me to file a ticket. I did. 

Then he decides to include in his email about how I shouldn’t wait until last minute. I am a mother to a toddler. I work 50+ hours a week and I just found out I was pregnant. As mentioned above this week I was sent to the hospital due to complications. I also have adhd and have been forced to come off of all medication. 

Needless to say, I have been struggling. The reason why my friend thinks it’s discrimination is because I haven’t procrastinated. I’ve worked on my assignments every night and all weekend with little to no sleep because I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong (which turned out to be a tech issue). Therefore the professor was improperly making assumptions. 

The reason why I don’t is because it’s not like he knew I had adhd or was pregnant. Although I do think it’s inappropriate to assume those things, I don’t know if that’s what’s going on here."

142,142,"[CO] Can a father keep a child from the mother if the parents are unwed, but voluntary paternity was established at birth?","In the state of CO, unwed parents can opt to sign a voluntary Acknowledgement of Parentage form at birth. This establishes paternity for the father. 

Also in the state of CO, for unwed couples, mothers maintain sole physical and legal custody until a court order is established. 

My child’s father and I signed the paternity form and we have always been unwed. Now separated. 

So in this case, if the father refuses to return the child at the agreed upon time, what can be done? Will the police be willing to get involved and demand the father return the child to mom? 

Also, if the father goes to work and leaves the child with family, can the mother/police then intervene to regain the child (since the child is not technically in the fathers custody at this point?)

I want to give my child to her father when he is not at work, in good faith that she will be returned to me before he returns to work. However, I’m not 100% certain he won’t try to keep her and give her to (very unsafe) family while he works.

Thank you in advance!

I indicated I wanted to merge, I wasn’t distracted, I checked mirrors and blind spots I’m very confused!? please help.

Also forgot to mention the other driver wasn’t even sure what happened himself, at first he said I was making an left turn from the opposite street into the right lane (I was not I had been travel straight my entire journey up to point of the incident) then he said I ran the red light from the left lane trying to merge into the right lane but I was always in the left lane and my light was most definitely green I believe cop sided with because I had no insurance at the time as of right now I am insured (accident was yesterday 4/13/2023"

He's only had one child, my mother, who's deceased. This son mentioned doesn't exist, and it's clearly an honest mistake by the attorney. I was present during the signing of this will, and it was made clear that I would be the only executor with no backup.

So I applied for this property and paid the $50 app fee, upon approval they require $1645 deposit to hold the unit (mind you when I paid them this at 4pm MST the unit stayed on their website until the next morning around 9am when I changed my mind) after sending the money they sent me the lease agreement. Once I reviewed it I decided I didn’t want to rent with them because It just sounded like a headache of a property company to deal with so I declined to sign. The lady then calls me and I tell her I declined to sign. She then starts getting upset because they “took the unit down and denied applicants”. I told her you said this was refundable when I asked you before sending it over and she said yeah it’s refundable at move out & I responded and told her well I didn’t sign a lease so you can’t legally keep my money. She gets upset and is just arguing back and forth and tells me to reach out to my bank. So I reached out to my bank and filed a claim and of course they can’t help because I processed the payment with my checking information which the lady told me to do because the fees would be cheaper this way… so anyway the property company was messaging me back and forth through the portal saying they can process a check of $1400 but they’re keeping the $250 admin fee, even tho I paid them $50 which should cover the cost to process my application and background 
check. So I keep asking them why they’re keeping $250 and that I will pick up my check to let me know when it’s ready and I keep telling them in the lease it says the lessee is required to pay the deposit and admin fee but I didn’t sign the lease so they are not entitled to keep that money. So anyway I see their office is almost closing and they haven’t responded so I try signing back in to the portal to send another message and now the portal is deleted but I do have emails of their responses still.

149,149,"[WA, USA] Am I required to submit the Motor Vehicle Claim for Damages form?","Hi everyone,

I recently got into a major accident that was not my fault, and unfortunately, my vehicle was totaled by an uninsured driver. Thankfully, my insurance company will be providing me with a pay off soon. However, I received a Motor Vehicle Claim for Damages form in the mail yesterday, and I have a few questions.

The form requests proof of loss, which in my case will be the document from my insurance company. Based on the language in the form, it seems that the driver's license of the uninsured driver will be suspended if I provide the required information.

My question is: am I required to fill out the form and send it to the Department of Licensing? And will there be any negative consequences for doing so? I noticed that there is a section in the form that indicates the information will be sent to the uninsured driver - should I be concerned about them knowing that I filed a case against them?

150,150,Is it alright for me to trespass on my neighbor’s property if I’m trying to retrieve a pet?,"My cat is strictly an indoor cat but, despite my best efforts, my family members always leave doors open and he gets out anyway. He always makes a beeline for my neighbor’s yard and jumps over the fence, meaning the only way for me to get him back is to either climb it or go around the neighbor’s house and get him, which is what I do. This has happened a few times. I live on a very busy road so I can’t just wait for him to come back— he might get hit by a car.

I always immediately leave and touch nothing except my cat. The neighbor in question is an elderly man who doesn’t speak English, and I don’t know enough of his language to ask him permission. Additionally, this almost always happens at night, and I feel it would be rude to wake him up when I could just walk in, get my cat, and leave. However, I’m nervous that this could get me into legal trouble if I’m caught. Would I have a leg to stand on in this situation?"

The person the bond was for failed to show to court but was apprehended on a bench warrant when they went to the surety company to fill out paperwork. 

My question is, even though the person failed to show, is it legal for this company to artificially inflate the surety to three times the court ordered amount? The court ordered amount is expensive as it is but from what I’ve read you normally only need to front 10% of a bond not 300%. Any advice is appreciated. The court is in Texas but said property is in New York."

155,155,"[Ontario, Canada] Unauthorized changes to credit card statement format, fraudulent charges, bank unwilling to reverse charges","I'm part of a small non-profit NGO. One of the credit cards our organization uses to purchase goods and services received a bunch of fraudulent/unauthorized charges starting three months ago. We have since cancelled and re-issued the card. Unfortunately, whoever stole our credit card information was fairly sophisticated and was also able to change how the monthly statement was delivered to us. We used to receive our monthly statement in the mail, but the fraudster was able to change the statement  format to online-only. Since we didn't get the credit card statement on paper to review every month the fraudulent charges completely slipped by.

The weirdest thing is that the bank never flagged these charges. The charges ended up being worth thousands of dollars and were for random things from Etsy and Wayfair, which we have never used the organizational credit card for. Contacting the bank was useless as they just put us on hold for hours only to tell us we're out of luck since the charges were over 30-days-old. Our organization is severely underfunded and the amount lost is setting us back quite a bit in terms of stability.

Any advice for recovering the money lost would be much appreciated! Our organizational cards are Mastercards with a bank that starts with B, ends with O, and with a commonly used name that is three letters long. Going forward we will likely implement changes to how we review finances (i.e. we will set a time aside every 30 days or less to review credit card statements) so this doesn't happen again as we absolutely can't afford losses like this without going under."

I saw copies of his bank accounts bc I had to confirm I didn’t know anything about them and wasn’t associated with them in any way.

160,160,Handling the death of a parent with no will and no assets,"For context, this is in the state of Wisconsin.

My (divorced) father passed away unexpectedly earlier this year and he did not have a will or any other legal documents for handling his death.

Additionally, my Dad basically had no measurable assets besides a used car (less than 10k in value). Bank accounts were empty, no house, no other large property, etc. In fact he owes more money than he had. He was mostly paycheck to paycheck.

My family is aware that we are not responsible for any of his debts. My Dad did have life insurance and a 401k which went to beneficiaries already.

My sister and I did a free consultation with a local lawyer who basically said we can disregard all of his debts and we don't have to worry about his ""estate"" because there basically is no estate - it would be insolvent. As for his car, we were told we could take it to the DMV to have it swapped into one of our names.

My questions are:

1. Is the approach of not worrying about his ""estate"" correct? If there is nothing to put in the estate, then there just isn't an estate right? 

2. We've been told we should file his taxes. If he owes money to the IRS, who is responsible for that given that there is no money in the estate?

3. Does anyone have any info on how to handle the car? I'm skeptical the DMV would just swap the car into someone's name. Money is also still owed on the loan for the car.

Is there anything else we should know about or consider?

Thank you for your time/advice."

I (19) have been with my girlfriend (17, 18 in a month) since she was a freshman. We live in southern Alabama. For a bit of context, she has been living with me for nearly 2 years. Her mother is a recently recovering heroine addict, and her father is abusive, physically abusive. She moved in with me when her mom spent all of the money for the power bill and groceries on her addiction. My gf has 5 siblings of which she is the oldest, and the youngest is 5.

Recently, her mom went to get clean. I am not sure if it was a hospital or a rehab center, but they reported her to DHR for drug use. When DHR came a few days later, 4/5 of the siblings were home alone. The 2nd oldest was off with friends. DHR heard the kids in the house alone. DHR is unaware that my gf was living with me at any point. 

They were forced to sign a safety plan, which included my gf. All 6 of them were forced to move over an hour away, away from school and their friends and into a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 family members who already lived there. The situation is uncomfortable and awful for my gf. She can no longer even go to school. Her mom has been clean on the past 2 drug tests, however. 

I, on the other hand, have been fairly lucky. I own my home, have a steady job putting me in upper-lower class, have a paid off car, keep my home clean, and food in my fridge. 

I would be fully willing to sleep on the couch to give my gf the room to herself if necessary, and I can pass a drug test.

170,170,Jeep dealer fraud,"I have a 2013 Jeep wrangler and it broke down while traveling out of city. Coolant spilled out and Jeep overheated. We had it towed to the nearest Jeep dealer and we had to communicate over phone over distance with them because it was not in a city we live in. We were susceptible and stranded. The jeep dealer said “you’re engine is melted and you need an entire new one and coolant system and it will be $13,000.” Also, they said they would give us $1,000 for trade in value for our jeep which is a huge slap in the face cuz just the metal frame itself is worth more than that and they told us we just need to buy a new jeep. We talked to a bunch of jeep enthusiasts online and they all (and so did I) thought we were getting scammed and we ended up taking it for a second opinion with an honest guy that specializes in Jeeps and he said the engine is FINE and all we need is a new thermostat and coolant overflow tank. Which will cost a total of $900 with labor. He also said the Jeep dealer lied about their diagnostics as their report said they did a “block test”which would be literally impossible with the broken coolant tank and the liquid would leak everywhere. I’m pretty dang mad abt how we were treated and lied to and this caused us insane amounts of stress and hardship as we had only 1 car for my family for a week. Idk if anyone has any experience with this kid a thing, but wondering if I can sue the jeep dealer or make a claim at a consumer protection agency of something? There is strong evidence of fraud here. At a bare minimum I’m going to leave a bad review and get my diagnostic money refunded. Any tips greatly appreciated!!

In the will she said I can have the house and all her finances. Leaving out my handicapped non-coherent brother who has a guardian in a different state. 

A lawyer my parents worked with who I spoke to said I’ll need to find out the exact value of the house and find out how much money my mother has in her bank accounts. The lawyer also said I’ll need to track down my brother even though he’s not listed in the will. 

I went to a bank I know they have, although I had the death cert and will they refused to give me any information citing that I’m not listed as a beneficiary. 

I went to a bank where I know they have their mortgage (small amount left) and it was the same thing. Refused to talk to me citing that I’m not a bene listed. They won’t even let me make a payment on their mortgage to keep it from defaulting. 

So how am I supposed to file anything at probate when I can’t fetch any numbers. The lawyer said “oh well watch out for their mail and try logging in to their accounts online” I don’t have my moms passwords or anything… 

It seems like a dead end to be honest.

172,172,I’m 21 and need to get my own separate bank account,"I don’t know if this is technically the right sub but it’s the first thing I thought of. I’ve had my own joint account with my mom since I was a teen and I never really thought anything of it but now I want my own. Problem is that my bank requires my mom’s signature/presence to actually get me out of the account and she refuses to go because all she does is want to control my funds and take my money. She’s telling me that i’m 21 and i need to figure it out because i’m grown when I literally NEED her there. Not want. If I could get my own account I would. How do I get out of the joint account without having her sign?? I already knew she would be difficult about this but i gave it a shot with her and now idk what to do.

Got ittt. Going to a different bank. I’m pretty clueless about life obviously but tyy guys 😅"
173,173,Aunt from Florida Owes me Money,"Back in July of 2022, my aunt (who lives in Florida) asked to borrow $1,000 from me (I live in Kentucky) and said she would pay me back the next day. I sent her the money through Zelle, and I still have not been paid back.

She said that she couldn’t get to the bank because she hurt herself, and then because Zelle wasn’t working. She said she would pay me back when I saw her in person. I visited her home in September of 2022 to celebrate her granddaughter‘s 15th birthday, and I found out that the money was used for the birthday party. Other people said that they also hadn’t been paid back their money and I realized they weren’t going to pay me back.

When I said I could tell I wasn’t going to be paid back, I got screamed at and they said they had my money. They blamed me saying they didn’t have food for the birthday party because I wanted my money back so badly. Spoiler: they didn’t have my money.

It’s now April 2023 and they said they would pay me back with their tax return money. They said that they filed back in January and still hadn’t gotten anything. Of course, they have no intention of paying me back.

Can I sue them for the money they owe me even though they live in a different state than me? How do I sue them?"
174,174,How enforceable is the non-compete that I stupidly signed,"I stupidly signed a non-compete with my current employer in New Jersey that states if I seek employment within 20 miles of the office at which I currently work I am liable for 2x my annual salary plus annual stipend & benefits paid to them within 90 days, which would add up to over $120,000. I learned my lesson with signing this sort of thing, I wasn’t really expecting to have an issue but I’m seriously considering going back to my old job which is within the 20 mile radius and I’m wondering if this is something for which I need to worry about my current employer actually going after me. I doubt something like this is seriously enforceable but I need to be sure if I make this transition."
175,175,Purchasing a small strip from neighbor ... what is the right process? (WA state),"## Background: 

this is in Washington State, Kitsap County, and we're outside of any city limits (barely but enough to not need to worry about that). 

---

## tldr; 

I may be purchasing a <>5' x <>60' strip of land that borders the front of my property that my neighbor currently owns. (much longer explanation below)

## Question: I haven't gone through this type of piecemeal property process before, only whole property purchases. What is the right way to go about filing an amendment to show my modified property line if a deal goes through?

I assume I'll need to file through a local property lawyer. In which case I'd appreciate pointers on how to find the right type of lawyer and any idea of the filing cost.

---

## Long Story:

When I bought my house (2016) I was never informed by the various parties that the alleyway was privately owned and I only have access to my driveway via an easement. The alley used to be a county road but was purchased / privatized by a neighbor at some point many years ago. Neighbor who owns it is also responsible for maintenance and they do an ok job so I'd never even thought about it being private. 

*(yeah, if this wasn't so far from the purchase date I'd be giving the realtor, seller, and whoever a piece of my mind)*

Getting more frustrating in the same discovery, I found out that the easement ends at the edge of my driveway. The drive is at the edge of my front border so I can reach the end of the easement without being legally allowed to drive past it even though my front yard goes farther down the alleyway. Neighbor past that point has an easement but I don't. 

Even better (worse), the owner of my house before me apparently got legal on the alley owner and they sued each other. And the prior owner of my house lost to the point where a 5' wide strip that -looks- like the front of my property is technically the alley even though it's higher than the alley and grown with yard plants. The neighbor owns not just the alley but the strip between my legal border and the alley. 

I'd been (before discovering all of this) planning to fence my front yard in such a way that I can use the front of the property for guest parking. Needless to say ... I currently can't. 

The prior owner of my house is obviously long out of the picture. The neighbor he sued passed away shortly before I moved here. But his wife still has a very bad memory of the whole legal thing and ended up saying she wouldn't give me easement or access to that 5' strip (and no, she doesn't do anything with it ... actually her lack of maintenance meant I took down the original fence that was on the very edge of my yard border because plants damaged it). 

However she did float the idea that I might be able to purchase it from her. I haven't had liquid funds up until now so had to back burner it. 

Assuming we can come to a dollar agreement, and it includes the easement so we can use it for parking, I want to make sure I know the process I need to follow."
176,176,I'm being verbally and sexually harassed by my neighbor,"I(36ftm) live in a government funded low income apartment for disabled people, in texas, and for the past 8 months I have been verbally and sexually harassed by my neighbor. He follows me, has threatened me with violence on multiple occasions, has made derogatory comments about my genitalia, threatened to kill my boyfriend, tried to lure my bf outside of the building to be attacked, stolen deliveries from my doorstep, cornered me in the elevator more that once, I have had to call the cops on him 3 times, but they won't do anything. It is strictly a violation of the lease to act in a threatening way toward another resident, but the housing manager refuses to do anything about it. What legal recourse do I have to make them do something about this lunatic before he decides to just get a gun and shoot me?"
177,177,Self-Representing - Petition under California probate code 17200.7,"Am considering self-representing to file one or more petitions under California probate code 17200.7, which includes allowing beneficiaries to petition the court to compel a successor trustee to produce the Trust documents, and allows beneficiaries to petition to remove the successor trustee or appoint a new one, amongst other things.

It will likely be LA Superior Court.  I am physically in northern California. 

I'm still calling law firms but getting the sense most want a huge retainer.  $10k seems ballpark, which I can't afford.

One attorney indicated at least as far as the successor trustee failing to produce the trust document(s), that is really pretty cut and dried, my case is very strong, and no lawyer would agree to represent a successor trustee who was refusing to provide the trust documents to the beneficiaries of the trust.   I asked whether, as far as the petition goes, I would be foolish to try and self-represent and she said no, not foolish.

I've sent a very strongly worded demand letter already and am gearing up for next steps, anticipating the successor trustee will either ignore me or again refuse to provide information.  If he isn't doing something unethical, he is giving every appearance of it as well as being incompetent in understanding what is required of him as successor trustee.  

Guy literally thinks he can just send me a check noted as inheritance and that is all the documentation I need. 

There is so much more to it, but that isn't why I'm posting.

My question is:

There is no form for filing a petition.  I did find the ""pleading paper"" that lays out the header for legal documents filed with the court, but I need to look at some samples of petitions and get a sense for what should be included in the body of the petition and how it should be structured.   Does anyone here know where I might find that?

Also, if anyone has experience self-representing in probate court I'd be interested to hear how it went for you.

Thanks in advance!"
178,178,"Bought a renovated home with an open permit in CA, and the work done didn’t pass inspection. Is the contractor obligated to bring it up to code?","There was some structural work and electrical work done by a CA licensed B- Contractor, and as title says it didn’t pass inspection. I’m assuming the contractor would be liable to do the repairs as his work was not up to code/done incorrectly, does that sound right? 

The seller of the property was the client of the contractor and they aren’t being very kind to us. Do we have the right to go directly to the contractor and demand the work be fixed?

The Warranty section of the contract between the Contractor and the sellers states “…the work will be free from defects.”"
179,179,Can I remove a fence without HOA approval?," In the summary of covenants and restriction of my Homeowners Association, there is mention in regards to removal of trees, but it only mentions requiring review and approval by the committee prior to *beginning installation* in regards to a fence. I live in a 20+ year old neighborhood and never hear of any “problems” from the HOA, and they do not enforce many of the things in the covenants such as campers in the driveway, mailbox standards, etc, but I am posting out of curiosity. 

Does the phrase “any construction or alteration of any structure which takes place on any Lot or to any Living Unit” apply to the complete *removal* of a fence?

Other phrases include “No structure shall be commenced, erected, placed or moved onto or permitted to remain on any Properties, nor shall any existing structure upon any Properties be altered in any way which materially changes the exterior appearances, thereof, nor shall any new use be commenced, all unless plans and specifications (including a description of any new use) therefore shall have been submitted to and approved in writing”"

I have no idea what I should be doing, how to contact attorneys or lawyers?

181,181,"My neighbour, whose driveway is parallel to mine, placed wooden planters in my driveway, blocking me from exiting my car. What can I do? [Quebec]","We have constant legal problems with this neighbour and none of them are ever resolved because they’re just minimal enough to not be worth talking to a barrister about.

But I’m really annoyed with her being brassy enough to put wooden planters in my driveway. They have fallen and the cars have been scratched, if I need to drive towards the back of my driveway I cannot exit my car except through the trunk, and she didn’t ask to put them there.

They’re on what is legally my property.

Can I use them as a place to put my cigarette butts or something? There are no flowers in them, just dirt. Occasionally they fall over and block my driveway entirely. Can I put flowers in them? If I can’t get rid of them, can I at least make them useful? 

Since they’ve been on my property for months now, can I just have them thrown out?

If I ask her to get rid of them, she will scream at me and make a huge scene. I’ve had to tow multiple cars from our driveway that were her guests, she’s placed random dumpsters in our driveway at 6 am without telling us… I’m sick of letting her petty behaviour slide and at minimum, I just want the planters gone.

I’ve tried moving them back onto her property line, and she’s moved them back into my driveway.

**Edit:**

A comment disappeared asking if I have documented previous incidents. The answer is yes, however in Canada our documentation is limited as both parties need to consent to recordings. So our cameras only point at whoever is at our front door and the very end of our driveway. All of our neighbours were informed about the camera installation and reassured we were not recording their property.

She has moved the planters out of view of the cameras. I have the Timestamp app and am considering taking photos twice a day to prove they have been abandoned on our property. I’m not sure if this would be worth my time, though. The local authorities have other things to do than care about her planters on my property - I even recently called 911 to report a downed power line that posed a danger to anyone walking on the sidewalk. The dispatcher told me “I wish Hydro-Quebec (city’s power company) would stop telling people to call us. It’s their problem.”

The cameras have captured other things such as her letting people park in our driveway, her verbally confronting me while I was standing on my porch by the front door (because we towed her illegal worker in our driveway), and her animals wandering onto our property.
By illegal, I mean that permission from the city to do construction was not obtained. If anyone wants to make physical changes/do renovations or construction, you need a permit from the city which protects the workers from being paid unfairly and ensures that safety measures are being taken. She doesn’t do that. We wanted to report this to the city, but we’re afraid of retaliation. She already tried to kill my dog once prior to installing the cameras."

183,183,Was fired without cause or reasoning for reporting an unregistered work truck.,"Long story short. I was a Refer Driver for a company for almost 2 years. Never had any issues with attendance or work related issues. Always got along with coworkers. No sit downs or talks about performance. In my opinion I was a valued employee. Even had some PTO coming up I was excited about.

Since October 2022 the company I worked for has been making me drive an illegal commercial vehicle. I attempted to contact my managers in the proper chain of command about getting this inspection done so I would not be pulled over or issued a ticket.

Over the course of 6 months this issue continually kept getting pushed off. When I began to push my GM more about it he lied to me and told me we were waiting on a part and service.

When I asked what part and service we are waiting on he never responded. I have documents and evidence of all of this. Even going back to January detailing how management was not responding to me when I approached others within the company that may have weight.

The service rack was also becoming detached and was at a point of coming off the vehicle while driving.

FF to last month when I began to contact folks in our HQ (out of state). This occurred on my Saturday shift. 

I come back to work the next week and after working for 6 hours my GM asked to talk to me.

He at first was asking how things were (that day my dog had a blood transfusion and I was dealing with that.)

That was when he mentioned that the act of contacting HQ went over him and he got in trouble due to my action. He was frustrated with me that I was trying to get some action moving on my concern.

Then it switched gears and he tried to get me to quit my job. After I told him I wasn’t going to quit he said ‘Well then we should go our separate ways.’

I asked if he was firing me and he said yes. When I asked for HR or my manager being present he declined. When I asked for the reason he did not give me one.

FF to today. I am still learning they are operating the vehicle illegally on expired tags & that HR is present at the location so they must see this also.

Would this be worth pursuing? I have plenty of evidence of negligence & feel this is a retaliation against me for going over my GM due to their inaction.

Have contacted the DOT, EEOC & an employment lawyer. I also filed unemployment that day.

Thanks to all that read this and assist me in my questions."

186,186,Failed by the school and regret trusting them after bringing my concerns to them! Can I do anything??,"I am looking for info on if I can hold my daughters school accountable in any way or what to do. And YES I KNOW they r NOT the only ones who are at fault here, and is some peoples eyes maybe not at all idk.
To sum it up as short as possible, I had an agreement with the school(vice principal & ROTC instructors) where she was supposed to be reporting to the ROTC room over her lunch period due to high concerns that I had with her activities that I knew about, where I saw it going, why I was as concerned as I was and make sure that they understood that certain things have been ongoing concerns in regards to her and told them the seriousness of this with example of past. I felt the VP was downplaying my concerns and not truly not understanding them for what they were, I expressed that to him and told him that she would not return if that was the case. His tone changed and we came to the agreement of her lunch time being at rotc and if not still reporting there I would be notified. Even spoke in person to the rotc instructors shortly after this and everything was clear. 
Now I find out that she hasn’t been reporting for lunch there for MINIMUM of the last 3 weeks and she was even leaving school property to go and engage in activities she knew better than! 
She is 15 and a sophomore in high school. Her and this other individual knew they were not to be in contact still with each other. He is a Jr and 17 and has a history of being mentally, and emotionally abusive to females, as well as trying to keep them hostage and so so much more. When the info got brought to me I said I needed proof before I could just believe it… well I received it. The school also knew I had concerns of this specific individual and y and how I knew what I did. 
Anyhow,they went off campus during lunch time when she isn’t supposed to be off campus period, but no one notified me either that she wasn’t reporting there for lunch any longer! We had an agreement! I made sure it was in place for a reason! 
Now charges have been filed on the 17 year old male due to the fact my 15 year old is not of age to consent. They both knew the possible consequences of their actions, and I only continued to allow my daughter to go there due to me trusting our agreement would be met! They failed us! Do I have a leg to stand on or what can I do if anything?"
187,187,Anonymous posting on Facebook,"Throw away account

TL;DR: Is there anything legally that can be done if as an admin of a group, I share the names of anonymous posters?

I created a Facebook group calling out a business for being shady. I did not realize just how bad it was and a bunch of people joined the group and were really bashing and bad mouthing not only the business but also the owner specifically. 

To no one's surprise other than mine, the owner filed a lawsuit for defamation against me for starting the group. I did not say anything bad personally, but was just allowing anyone to post anything in the group. I had anonymous posting turned on. 

The business owner is willing to drop the lawsuit against me if I give him the names of the people who posted anonymously. At this point I can not afford to have to fight the lawsuit, I started the group because I had been dealing with the business for almost 9 months over an issue I could not afford to fix. (The fix was also under a warranty).

My question is: Am I legally allowed to share the names of the anonymous posters. Is there any legal or civil action that the anonymous posters can take against me if I share their names?

I have searched and searched and searched. I have attempted to contact anyone and everyone I possibly can. I can not find an answer anywhere. I also can not find a way to contact Facebook directly. I've tried META and they are no help. Does anyone know if there is someway to actually contact Facebook?"

this happened a few days back when a driver randomly started tailgating me in traffic (yes I was going the speed limit) I tried switching lanes to let him pass but he began to side swipe and brake check me, I slowed down and switched lanes so he’d leave me alone but It kept getting worse. At some point he slowed all the way down to get closer to me, rolled his windows down, and started waving for me to get closer to his vehicle so he could side swipe me again. Sometime later when traffic came to a stop he waited till I got closer to his vehicle then started throwing stuff at me, then when I stopped at the red light he came out and started smashing my windows, I kept pressing the lock button on my car but somehow he managed to open the door and punched me multiple times, the first initial punch cut my forehead open and It started gushing out blood (gave me a deep cut) I told him to please stop Multiple times, he eventually did and I drove into the nearest gas station out of panic, I did not get his license plate and I have been pissed off for the last couple days because I can’t do anything about it.

A few weeks ago I had a blow up with my mother and had to leave my home where I have lived for the last few years. I left and spent the last few weeks in a VA hospital psych ward to get some help for some things. I am now out and living with my son, however my things are still at my mothers house. I want to go back and get them but they are not on good terms with me and I am worried about even going there alone. My son is going to get a Civil Standby from the local police to accompany us to my old home, and get my belongings. I am also worried that they are not going to allow me to get things that belong to me. I am a blind disabled veteran, I have lived in that house for the last 12 years, and I am in the state of Missouri. Is there anything I should do legally to make this easier for me? I am trying to make this as civil and smooth as possible, but I do not know what to do if they say I can't have something that is mine. They have already told my son they have started throwing my things away and that certain things are not mine that are.

194,194,Implications of paying a Collection Bill?," Long story short: an urgent care facility charged me for a deductible my insurance fully covered. I received a bill and reported it to my insurance, which confirmed they took care of it. They didn't. I received a collection bill notification. After several phone calls (and hours on hold) between the insurance company, the facility, and the collection agency I just want this to go away

I'm so annoyed to the point that I want to pay the negligible amount ($35) to make the thorn go away and report the facility. Before I do, I wanted to know if there would be any damaging implication for paying the collection fee. Would it impact my credit? Show up on future background checks, etc?"
195,195,"Apartment Complex not maintaining building, and I'm anxious about spending the 200$ for a legal consultation if it turns out I don't have a case.","I'm a first time renter, and have been at this property for \~3 years. Largely things have been fine, I like it well enough, but since the beginning there has been a pattern of management being unwilling to help with issues in the apartment. In the first three months after I moved in, the toilet flooded without warning and I ended up with poop water in three different rooms before my girlfriend discovered the problem. To be clear, the toilet wasn't backed up, they share a pipe system with other units or something. Management responded when I called, fixed the issue, but didn't do anything about the standing water. When I asked what I was meant to do, the maintenance worker told me, and I quote, ""get a mop and a bucket."" At the time, I just didn't know better, and tried to clean it, but after an hour realized I wasn't equipped to do so, and called maintenance again. This time they handled it, but I'm laying this out because it's just par for the course.

More recently in February, the roof in the master bedroom began leaking during heavy rainfall in San Diego. When I say leaking, I mean it was raining in my bedroom.  Just pouring water from several different spots down the walls and making bubbles in the paint and soaking into the carpet. Buckets  were no use, because the water wasn't dripping straight down, it was running down the wall. Kinda hard to get a bucket under that. I called the emergency maintenance line and informed them of the problem and was laughed at. I was told that it was ridiculous to expect them to come out while it was raining. At the time I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously, but I thought that it was more or less reasonable that they couldn't do anything while it was raining, so I waited the night out. When I called the next day they said they'd open a ticket. I told them that they needed to look at it now, because it was forecasted to rain again that night, and so much water was getting in that I believed the problem would escalate quickly if they didn't deal with it then. Predictably, I was ignored and they sent me a ticket by Email. I don't have it in front of me, but I think they had me waiting 48 hours, however the morning of, I got an email saying my ticket had been closed. They never even came to look at it. I ran in circles with this process for nearly TWO MONTHS before they even came to look at it. I called, I emailed, I went to the office, but they just wouldn't show up. (Although, somewhere in there they did tell me they were coming to replace my windows, (tf?) but that date came and went too without them showing up or following up.)

When they finally did look at it, it turned out that there was a soccer ball blocking a drain on the roof, causing water to pool and leak in. If they had just dealt with it then, it would have been over with, but they just wouldn't come. Now, the entire wall has rotted through, and into the next bedroom, so we've been moved to another apartment while the tear the wall out and change the carpet and floor boards, (one of them had warped so bad the it had practically rotated 90 degrees under our feet,) Since then, they've failed to show up as scheduled twice, and haven't provided me with a date at which they'll have the work finished. I work from home, and am currently trying to work on a 2Mpbs connection, which sucks, but my roommate, whom also works at home, has literally had the power shut off without warning, and then they up and left for lunch without alerting her to what they had done. I ended up running an extension cord to the kitchen to get her setup working, but jesus, seriously?  

The more I type, the less anxious I fell about contacting a lawyer, but I'm basically stupid, so any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated. <3

PS: There's definitely more too, like offering to send help moving the bedroom and then just not doing that, and my girlfriend crying her eyes out because she doesn't have access to any of the things that help her with her severe depression, ect, but I did my best to be concise. Again, I called and emailed over and over and over, I wasn't complicit in the lack of communication, and have pictures, phone records, & Emails."
196,196,Can I trademark a company name that I plan to use in the future?,"As the title says, is there anyway to trademark a name of a company that I have in mind without actually owning a business or even planning to anytime soon? I only want to keep the name safe and in a few years, maybe 3-5 to be exact, I plan on actually using the name for a business. I live in the US, California more specifically, although when I do start my business it will be in a different state."
197,197,Can a landlord take a tenants last months rent and ask the other tenants to pay for there rent? Even if the roommate already paid the rent with his last? And the roommates are on the same lease.,My roommate was telling me he paid for the other roommates rent because he moved out in the middle of the lease and even though the landlord was paid the last rent when the other guy moved in he still has to pay rent.
198,198,Am I entitled to a refund from Southwest??,"I would greatly appreciate any input. We had a flight in which the return flight was cancelled 3 hours prior to take off. No delay, no warning, just straight cancelled. We only found out because we were actively logged into the SW app and constantly updating, otherwise the text for cancellation didn’t come until 90 minutes after that! We would have been at the airport by then.

Anyway to make a long story short we found the only flight we could find on the SW app that goes back to Midway. This flight unlike our other flight was not straight through, and it actually turned out to be a 9 hour flight with several stops. The thing is we HAD to get home so we booked the flight. $1800 for 4 people to travel a distance of 2.5 hours on a plane. 

When we got to the airport we went to SW customer service who stated they could not refund us our flight for the one we booked or the one that was cancelled, and that we would need to contact SW customer service by phone for assistance.

So we get home and call them up the next day. They apologized and promised us a full refund for the flight we booked for $1800 since that’s the flight they likely would have put us on anyway. We were told it would be fully refunded but will take 7-10 business days to process. Great! We thanked them and went about our business.

10 days later the only “refund” we got back to our SW card was two $5 amounts. Confused we give them a call, and we were told that actually nope we won’t be getting a refund! They said they decided to let us keep the points and refunded us the taxes for the flight, but they will not be refunding the $1800 they promised us.

The fact we had to contact them and they didn’t even notify us of this “change” is enraging! When we complained we were told “ sorry case closed there’s nothing we can do, contact the better business bureau”

Do I have a case here? If they explicitly told me they would refund the money and without notifying us decided they wouldn’t? At the very least I think we are entitled to a refund for the flight that was cancelled. How would I go about getting a copy of that recorded phone call? Thank you for any advice!"
199,199,Fairly certain somebody stole my $260 Airpod Pros; is a location on my iPhone legitimate evidence?,"So as the title says, I think my Airpods were stolen. I'm in high school and I'm a track runner, and I went onto the field with my AirPods in. I ran some warmups with them still in, then I know for a fact I put them back in my case and set them on the ground near my backpack. Yes I know that was a dumb idea but hey I'm definitely learning that now. So I come back to look for them about an hour later and they're just straight up gone.

So I went to the ""Find My"" app which tracks everything you have that is apple, but it had said that they were last seen about 20 minutes ago (when i first looked at it) right there on the field with my phone. Long story short, I tried a lot of things and I can fairly confidently assure you they aren't on the field. I looked for about an hour and checked the app again only for it to say they were still last seen right there on that field at 4pm.

So It's currently 6:29 PM when I'm writing this, and it still says it was last seen on the field at 3:58 PM. So i'm like 95% sure that someone took them home with them and it just hasn't updated yet. I have them set to missing on the app which makes them not connect to anyone else and will notify me whenever they are opened.

So this all got me thinking; if the location updates to someone's house and they claim they don't have it, to what extent can I get cops involved? I have the digital receipts of when I bought them, and they actually have an engraving of my nickname on them. So I have lots of proof that they are mine. But if they claim they don't have them but the location is showing that is inside their house, does that have any value to law enforcement?

Here's pretty much what I'm trying to do here if the law permits. First off if the location updates to some random person's house, I'll go there and politely ask for my airpods and show the receipt. The legal advice I'm asking for after that is that if they refuse, I'll call the cops and show that I have my iPhone reporting that my airpods are inside that person's house. Can they use that as a reason to search them?

Yes I'm aware house searches are pretty serious and typically require warrants, but I'm aware there's certain scenarios where a warrantless search is allowed, which I'm not an expert on. And heck if I were to need to, certainly this wouldn't be enough evidence to show to a judge to issue a warrant, right?"
200,200,Wrong Lease End Date on Lease Renewal Offer,"I received a lease renewal offer 1/24 stating my lease was expiring 4/30 and I would have to choose between one of their new renewal options or switch to month-to-month. Its a signed document, though I only have a pic of it. I found a new apartment, signed the lease, gave the old complex a notice only to receive an email stating my lease actually ends 6/30 so I would have to stay or break the lease.

Called the office, they acknowledge they sent the renewal notice but my lease says 6/30 so according to them that is what matters.

Am I in the right here? I know I should have verified the lease before moving but I went off the document they sent me."
201,201,"[FL] My former landlord sold the property I was renting because I agreed to leave. I only ""agreed"" because the buyer issued me an eviction notice prior to the property ever being sold.","Our story will take place in Tallahassee, Florida. On March 12th, 2022, I received a ""Termination of Tenancy"" notice from- let's call her, Kunt. At the time, Kunt was my landlord's roommate, and my (duplex) neighbor's mother. Prior to receiving this notice, my neighbor has frequently spoken to me about how horrible and manipulative her mother was. Kunt shows up at my door and hands me this notice, explains that my landlord is retiring and has sold the property to her. She offered a very generous amount of time to move out (May 15th, 2022), and even an incentive to move out early. Up to this point, I had been living at this property for probably about three years. 

Not particularly relevant legally, but for some context:
My landlord is incredible. I'd had many issues with my mental health back then, and every time my landlord was so very forgiving about late rent payments and any drama I caused them. At the time, I had also just broken up with my partner, who moved into that house when I first got it. I loved that house, and considered buying it on multiple occasions. Needless to say, with everything going on at the time, I simply cried about the situation and cursed the forces that be for giving me such a rough time.

I had assumed that the sale was a done deal, and never bothered to ask my landlord about it. Fast forward to now. Comparatively, I am living in a far worse place with far more people than I'd ever wanted in my home. I've had several of my belongings stolen, damaged, and destroyed. I had to sell a lot of very valued things in order to even have space to live. Despite all that, I am doing well for myself. The only unfortunate thing is my living situation! I'm having to move, now for the third time, and thought I'd message my former landlord and offer my appreciation while I was in the headspace of having to move (quietly hoping she would potentially know of any affordable places to live in my area).

Well! My landlord texts me back shorty after asking, ""What retirement? What eviction notice?"" For those who can't pick up on context clues (or those who neglected to read the title), THE EVICTION NOTICE WAS FAKE. Kunt lied to my landlord by telling her that I was okay with moving out given sufficient time and she never thought to question it. According to my landlord, Kunt signed a contract to (if I understood correctly) buy the house on May 11th, but the house was never sold until April 30th. The notice I was given specifically states that the property had been sold to her, signed by her and everything. I even kept it for sentimental value!

Basically, I'm wanting to know if we have a case, and if so, what could either of us ever even hope to get out of this? I don't imagine she could be forced to return the house for buying it under false pretenses, but that would be my dream scenario. I'm young and completely ignorant legally. I made the mistake of telling my former neighbor all this (again, her daughter), and now Kunt knows I'm onto her. I assured her I was too broke and busy moving to a different state to take legal action, but that was only in the hope that she wouldn't preemptively start preparing a defense. I want justice for myself, my landlord, and my neighbor (who, I failed to mention is a single mother. I suspect this situation arose due to the mother wanting to manipulate her daughter and control her, and her granddaughter's life) I will take any and all advice here. Thank you generous redditors so very much for this and everything you do on this sub. Even if my situation is a bust, you're making a difference."
202,202,"My Parents are divorced and I feel like my mother is trying to ""collect dirt"" on my dad.","Hello, the situation I'm dealing with involves my parents' divorce, and my mother's behavior towards my father afterwards. I am a minor and reside with my father, although I still spend some time with my mother occasionally. However, during these visits, I have noticed that my mother often asks probing questions that imply she is seeking information about my father. As a result, I have made it clear to her that I will not discuss my father or any details related to him with her. Nevertheless, I feel as though she has become more adept at disguising her inquiries, making it difficult to talk about how I'm doing without mentioning my father. I hardly text her anymore because of this.

This has been going on for around a year now, and recently, it appears that my mother's behavior has become more aggressive. She has been taking photographs of the addresses on our mail, which my father has sent to his girlfriend's residence due to safety concerns with the mail system at our apartment. Furthermore, while my mother was talking to me at the entrance of our apartment, I noticed her taking pictures of the interior. When I requested that she delete the photos, she declined, refused to show me the camera roll, and left.

I am worried about any potential negative consequences that my father may face due to my mother's actions. Is there any advice you can offer on what steps I can take or what I can tell my father to ensure our safety?"
203,203,What is the process of terminating my lease (uninhabitable apartment in VA),"Hi. I’m currently living as a sublease in an apartment. The sublease goes until the end of june, i already paid for April so I just have may and June left to pay for but I want to break the lease early because there are squirrels living in the crawl space area between my ceiling and the roof. 

It has gotten to the point that they broke a hole in the ceiling through the wall. They are loud constantly, running around and crawling at the ceiling. I believe it is definitely a health violation.

I have told the landlord about it many times, called and texted and sent pictures and videos. I started talking to him about it the beginning of February, it’s now mid April and the problem has only gotten worse. He only has his handyman come to try to fix it and patch up the hole but it doesn’t work and he wont hire an outside company. 

I am planning on breaking the lease 2 months early as it is uninhabitable at this point. 

What is the process of doing this? Do I just give him written notice and leave and stop paying? Or is there something else I have to do to like “break the lease” or declare it uninhabitable. I have a ton of photo and video evidence as well as many text messages to my landlord. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated thank you!!!!"
204,204,Insurance company is denying mental health claims due to televisit doctor’s location. Anything I can do?,"I signed up with a virtual mental health company a few months ago. The first bill is finally becoming due, and the insurance company is denying all claims as they are saying provider is out of network. The doctor who treated me is licensed in the state that I am located in, but was located in a different state at the time of treatment. The mental health company told me I was in network with my insurance prior to treatment, as they only see patients whose insurance they accept. I also have emails from the mental health company stating my copay will be $20. I have already submitted a written appeal to the insurance company. Is there anything else I can do?"
205,205,Can I call my Landlords lender to tell him of his neglect?," 

I didn't realize that property investors like my landlord exist. His behavior and his language can be misogynistic; he gaslights, or completely fails to communicate.

We just moved into the apartment in July 2022. From the beginning, we started noticing issues. There was a horrible smell coming from the kitchen cabinets, mold, and roaches, just to name a few. I have documented all issues and kept all correspondence and pictures.

While attempts to remove the mold have been made and the cabinet was replaced, we still have many unresolved issues: a roach problem (mainly the garage) that we have been tracking, a broken window, and an unsanitary garbage common area that is roach infested. We are not hopeful that we can work this out on our own, so we need guidance.

We paid out of pocket for a home inspection in January that revealed multiple leaks and mold in the home and garage. Code enforcement was called regarding the leaks, and while some attempts to address this have been made, we still have many outstanding issues and have not heard from him since March 29th.

Most recently, we emailed our landlord requesting clarification about his understanding about what a security deposit is. During early conversations about mold and smell in our kitchen, he made a comment that he had spent a lot of our deposit already. We are concerned that our deposit may not be refunded to us.

Our attempts to reach out to our landlord have been trying. He has a Google number and at times does not accept calls. And he doesn't list his physical address; instead, he hides it behind a California privacy law that protects elected officials. I am pretty sure he isn't an elected office. Google search returns nothing of that nature.

208,208,Advice Needed - Tenants Rights,"

We live in a 4-plex apartment. Since February we have been receiving messages from our landlord stating that someone is complaining about weed smoke in the units. Last time they said they would charge all 4 units a violation fee if they got another complaint. Well today we finally got that message stating that someone complained again and they have now charged us a violation fee. It’s already showing on our account as due and we’re just wondering if this is something they can reasonably do or if there is anything we can do to prove we are not. We sent a message asking if there was anyway we can avoid this and we got the most insincere detached response.

209,209,Apartments Application of Rules,"Nashville TN

Hello, I currently live in an apartment and the leasing office is finding me for breaking an apartment rule. However, there is a good number of other residents that are also breaking the same rule and they have not had the rule applied to them. Is there something that can be done about the rules not being applied fairly to everyone? 

For context about the rule, it’s about strorage on the balcony. I had some chairs that were not patio chairs and received a fine because it’s not patio furniture, however there are other residents with non-patio furniture out that I just spoke with and they did not receive the fine or anything about it. I live on the bottom floor, and the other people live on the second floor, so I feel like I’m being picked on since I’m on the bottom. 

Thank you to anyone that can help here, my google searching keep taking me to fair housing rights on discrimination and I’m not sure if that’s the direction I need to be in as it doesn’t feel racial or due to disability/health."

When we moved in we got a 6 month lease and paid first and last month's rent plus a 3500 dollar deposit ($1000 of that was non-refundable pet fee, no idea if this is relevant). We asked him for another year lease on the property and when he brought the paperwork he had another first and last months rent payment on the lease agreement. Rent didn't go up at all.  He's not raising the actual monthly rent it in any way. I'm just wondering since we already paid first and last 6 months ago how this would apply? And am I misunderstanding how lease agreements work? Is this legal?"
211,211,Protecting Assets (house) from Medicaid Estate Recovery,"I posted a comment in another forum about my situation and was referred here by other posters.

I am a 54 year old woman. I work as a lunch lady in an elementary school and I make about $24k/year. I am raising an 8 year old granddaughter and we are in the process of adoption. My 14 year old granddaughter (via kinship, not biological) has just come back to live with me as well. The girls will qualify for Medicaid until they're 18 regardless of our situation or their status living here (ie; adopted, foster care, kinship care, whatever.) I am also on Medicaid at present.

As I said, I'm 54 and will be 55 later this year. I own a home that will be entirely mortgage-free in just a couple of years. The Medicaid Estate Recovery Act kicks in at age 55. I have been planning to decline Medicaid coverage before I turn 55 in order to protect the house. (They SAY they don't ""take the house"" but as your home is the only asset you can have when you're on Medicaid, that's a deceptive thing to say!)

Anyway, my family has been poor or working poor for generations and I want to leave at least a LITTLE something for my granddaughters so I am going to have to get off Medicaid.

I don't qualify for health insurance through my employer because I technically work two part-time positions under two different programs. I went to the HealthCare Marketplace to price getting insurance on my own. OMFG. $519/month for the lowest priced plan and my annual out of pocket will be $18,000. It's almost as if it's priced to exactly cost everything I make so I have to stay on Medicaid.

My other thought was to just go without and use the free clinics for what I can, pay out of pocket if I need simple things and declare bankruptcy if I incurr more catastophic (to me) medical bills.

A commentor on the other forum suggested putting the house in my granddaughter's name but I've seen that be a really bad move. Another mentioned a trust but I don't really have the assets to actually form a trust (I mean, seriously, I'm on MEDICAID!)

Is a trust something that can be done basically only for a house - one that's really only worth about $150,000? Is it really pricey to do or is there such a thing as legal aid for this kind of thing? I am in Des Moines, IA where we do have a law school and a legal clinic but I was kind of under the impression that they really only help with criminal cases.

Can anyone give me an idea of what to do here? I'm normally very in favor of taxes and being responsible for one's self because we all have to do our part but those insurance prices really pissed me off and I'd have no ill feeling if I had to file a bankruptcy over medical expenses if it came to it just to make sure this house doesn't go to the state over something like that."

He simply showed up to school with a birth certificate and his ID and they release the child to him. The father is now not returning any phones calls.

My grandma just had a total hip replacement and pelvic reconstruction and has been wheelchair bound since November. She can walk a little bit with a walker now, but he replaced her old walker with a new one and now he is saying since he bought it he can take it away even though she literally relies on it to do basic functions like use the bathroom and grab snacks. He is hiding her stuff from her and continually harassing her as she's just laying in bed watching TV. 

I am her PoA and main caretaker, but I live an hour away and visit once or twice a week to make sure she has everything she needs and gets any help she can while I'm there. She even has a pet bird who she loves, but he is also denying her access to him.

214,214,Collecting fountain coins and repaying the state,"So in the last few months I've heavily gotten into coin collecting. It makes me very happy and I see a lot of different variations of pennies, nickels and dimes. I have even found a few wheat pennies. I want to expand the areas that I collect and start fishing out of fountains. I wouldn't necessarily be stealing them because I would be getting a hold of the parks and rec for my area and paying them the same amount in the coins that I find in cash or a check or something to that nature. I'd basically be buying coins out of face value from fountains. Of course! I'm going to be doing this with permission from my city or state but I wanted ideas on how I would go about this. Anyone knows if there is a permit for this. I know the coins that get collected in the fountains usually go to charity so of course I would repay what I take cent for cent. Any questions, suggestions or thoughts?"
215,215,[CO] Is there a legal limit homeowners insurance can take to payout?,"Over two months ago I had to file an insurance claim with my HOA. The claim was accepted, but payment for repairs has yet to be sent.

My wife and I have had to fund all repairs out of pocket, and this is creating significant financial hardships on us. 

1. Because the HOA won't give us the insurance payment until after repairs are complete.

2. They just now informed us insurance has not provided any payment for repairs yet. Even though I've kept in consistent communication with them every step of the way. 

3. They never once mentioned insurance hasn't paid yet even though they approved us going ahead with the repairs. Even stated they would right a check the same day they were complete. Only now that the repairs are almost done do they realize they can't do that.

219,219,Vehicle break-in.,"Hey everyone, I'll try to keep this short and sweet. The property that I live at has a garage door entry to the underground parking. 3 weeks ago, another Tennant ran into the garage door with their vehicle, completely wrecking it. My landlord has taken the damaged garage door off its tracks and it is simply laying, mangled inside the parking lot. For these 3 weeks, the parking stall for us all has been completely wide open, and unmitigated to people walking in and out regardless if they have a key or not. Fast-forward to last night. My vehicle was broken into and the bastatd tore apart my steering column and the door itself (my truck was locked). The criminal was able to just walk right and do this since the garage door is non-existant. Do I have any legal recourse at all? Is the Landlord liable in any way to pay the cost of my repair (the total was $1200 for the fix and 2 keys) in any way? Is it legal fir them to not fix a garage door for 3 weeks, exposing the vehicles inside to potential vandalism like me? I pay extra every month to have access to a secured parking spot, so the payment for this service is not being rendered as nothing is currently secured.Also, can they evict me if I sue them for the damages? Please let me know and have a good say."
220,220,Transgender discrimination in workplace,"Long story short. I’m a P.I.C. At a sub shop. Pic stands for person in charge the lowest form of manager.

I’ve been transitioning for prob almost 3 years now.
I changed my name about like a year into it and my general manager refused to call me by my new name since “it didn’t fit me and that’s not who he knows me as”

Until my coworkers basically made him call me by my real name.
Around like 2 years I got comfortable with my voice to where I started to use it at work. And immediately the general manager and my night time driver made fun of me non stop for it.

To where I stopped using it. Every so often I tried to use it and would get made fun of and stopped. Now I don’t feel safe or comfortable talking how I feel at work.

My nighttime driver also likes to make fun of the fact that I have a bf and stuff. To be honest. We play around a lot but he likes to be homophobic a lot. He will call me fa**ot and I’ll just call him one back.

Lately I’ve told him that I don’t want to keep it going like this. Since. Ya sometimes it’s kinda funny but mostly it just hurts. He went off saying if I don’t like it quit basically.

I talked to my general manager about it and he’s just like ya that sounds like him nothing we can do.

I can’t talk how I want and when I do I’m told things like “how hard do you have to squeeze your balls to sound like that”

Im. Just done at this point and plan on quitting.

My bf thinks that this situation has contributed to a lot of my depression and stuff. He thinks I should take legal action for discrimination but idk. Can I even make a cases. I have plenty of people willing to back me up. Also I can get evidence I don’t have any but if I talk like I want and record it I can get evidence.

Do I have a case?

I was particularly curious as to the legality of hentai characters where there is a possibility, but it is unknown/impossible to tell if the characters are under the age of 18. Note that I am not talking about loli or shota hentai. I do not watch/read either of these. However, a huge portion of the characters in hentai are said to be in school (mostly meaning high school). For example, recently I saw one covering very adult looking women alongside an feminine (so especially difficult to tell) male. However, the characters (both the male and females) are implied to be in school. Mentions of whether they are in high school are not made, their ages are not given, and the characters even live alone (no parents present). This particular one has multiple parts both in animation and book, of which have been published by US companies as well.

I have seen a lot on the talk of legality of loli/shota, but few have asked about something like this. My main concern is could hentai, where it is maybe implied but it is actually difficult/impossible to tell the actual age of a character, illegal?

I should also note, that I am looking mostly at federal law, but I live in Florida for anyone who knows specifics on it here. I also marked as NSFW, for pretty obvious reasons."
222,222,Oklahoma - EEOC charge filed for terminating me because I have ADHD,"-I worked for a municipality and the city manager, knowing I had ADHD, kept making derogatory comments about how my adhd impacted my ability to listen 

-after having a conversation with the city manager + HR/city clerk/accountant (all in one), the comments stopped for awhile

-a few months later, I was called into a disciplinary meeting with the city manager + HR/clerk/accountant where I was asked about a change in my medication because my behavior was “off”

-following this meeting, I reported the comments to a city council member because I obviously couldn’t report it to HR

-at the next city council meeting (4 days later), the city manager was terminated 

-3 days after that, an interim city manager was hired

-5 days following the hiring of the interim city manager, the HR/clerk/accountant made a (false) claim that I had said I wanted to get her (the HR person) fired.

-3 days after the false claim, I was fired by the interim manager 

My lawyer says that the weak link in my case is proving that the interim city manager knew about my condition upon firing me.

How can I try to prove this?"
223,223,Is an anonymous audio recording admissible in court?,"I know someone who is due for pretrial may 8th for doing a horrible thing to a minor. I have an audio recording sent from him to me over social media in less eloquent terms he was unable to finish and wishes he would've recorded it and sold it for millions he also details who he was talking about in the recordings.  The guy is crazy and unhinged is this something I can take to the district attorneys without implicating myself to testify or is it meaningless without me saying ""without a doubt this was sent by him on his social media."" ?"
224,224,A neighbor is suing my parents for custody of their cat they've had for years,"(NOTE: Throwaway for obvious reasons; happy to verify my main account with the mods if that's against the rules. Also my apologies if this flair is incorrect; I chose the one that felt most accurate.)

So my parents adopted a friendly stray cat a few years ago who had been wandering our neighborhood for months. They had no collar, no chip, no shots or any evidence that they may have belonged to anyone else before, and attempt was made to find an owner pretty thoroughly before properly adopting them, both from my parents and others in the neighborhood (using resources like Nextdoor and Facebook). Since then they've been chipped and given appropriate shots and veterinary care on the regular.

Suddenly just a week ago, one of our neighbors saw a picture of the cat on social media and decided that it's actually their cat who has supposedly been missing pretty close to around the time we adopted ours. They've made multiple requests to my parents to pass over custody of their cat, which my parents of course denied. Today they received certified mail from this neighbor stating the intent to sue if custody of the cat isn't granted.

I'm convinced the neighbor is lying for a multitude of reasons. For example, they claim their lost cat has the same name as the one my parents adopted, but I was the one who suggested that name for my parents' cat, which sounds like it would be a very remarkable coincidence. Said neighbor also claims to have not seen any attempts to find an owner on Nextdoor because they didn't have a Nextdoor account at the time, but a perusal of their account shows they've been an active user on Nextdoor for YEARS before my parents adopted their cat. Said neighbor also suddenly put up a post on Nextdoor looking for their lost cat shortly before confronting my parents, which doesn't make sense if this was a cat they've been missing for years. And those are just the few big ones.

So like, what are my parents' options here and what does the law say? Should they call this neighbor's bluff? Countersue for emotional distress? Is there even any precedence on someone claiming someone else's cat as theirs YEARS after said cat was adopted ""on the books,"" with no ownership evidence of their own? I'm just really scared because we all love this kitty as family, and someone literally down the street from us coming out of nowhere to say we stole the cat from them has been distressing as hell."
225,225,Legality of Satire,"I want to publish a satirical diet book. I have a family member that falls victim to them, and recently spent $3k for a diet plan that was essentially ""eat fruits and vegetables with our expensive essential oils"". Yes, it's a pyramid scheme too haha.

Because I feel it is relevant, the ""satire diet"" would have ridiculous concepts like ""eat meals where all the food is the same color"" and science mumbo jumbo like ""photonic physicists have been studying the qualities and applications of chromatic therapy to balance the internal color spectrum and restore integrations between vital systems of the body""

It's fake. Super fake. But part of what makes it funny is treating and displaying the obviously fake information as if it was true, and I suppose if someone got hit really hard in the head and then skimmed through it, it might seem real. It has to look and feel like a real diet book, but is this legal? To portray false information in a manner that seems valid?

Would having a disclaimer that very clearly (in small font) states "" Please note the information contained in this book is entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. All claims, theories, and suggestions presented in this book are entirely made up and have no scientific basis. The author and publisher hereby disclaim any and all liability to any party for any direct, indirect, implied, punitive, special, incidental or other consequential damages arising directly or indirectly from any use of this book or its content. "" actually do anything?

Also, could I give the author a pen name with ""Dr."" in it? Is there any legal requirements to using that preffix? In the book, I might mention this fake author studying some kind of biology, but make it clear it isn't a medical dr.

I would not be trying to make money off this book. But could I sell it as a sort of ""comedy"". I feel like half the humor would be the fact that it actually exists and is possible to buy."
226,226,Copyright Infringement Retraction for Money?,"Hello, this is an oddly specific question that might be stupid. But I own exclusive rights to a viral video that hundreds of people are reposting on YouTube. I filed over 300 copyright claims this week to get the reposts removed from YouTube. However, I am now getting emails from dozens of people asking me to retract the copyright claim because it put a strike on their YouTube channel. They stole from me, so I have no intentions of retracting claims. However, I'm starting to think, completely because of the volume of requests, that I could charge money for a retraction? Larger YouTube accounts would be willing to pay money to not have a strike on their account. But would that even be legal? I know this is a stupid question but I'm just curious."
227,227,Court order to obtain Western Union transaction history?,"Basically, my father is having a disagreement with his brother, which has led to a dispute over the property in India that was left to both of them by their father. He has been pursuing legal stuff over there since that is where the property is, which includes the house his brother currently resides in. 

However, our family lives in the United States. We requested transaction history from Western Union which they sent to us, showing payments from the last 10 years that my father has sent to his brother, along with the dates & conversion amount. However, their website only allows us to request from the past 10 years, nothing over that. Would we able to get a court order (or anything else) that would allow us to request history further than that? Since a majority of the money that my father sent him was before 2013, it would be helpful to have to show them, especially since his brother denies the fact that my father has sent any money in the first place."
228,228,Neighbor keeps harassing us and now put these out.,"Hi!

I recently relocated to Rochester Minnesota in December for my wifes job. We bought our home and we love everything except our neighbors.

Ever since we have moved in they have constantly harassed us about their fence citing that we were ""piling up snow"" on it. Regardless of the fact that I told them that snow comes from the sky, not from our garage and reminded them about the middle school concept of snow drift/erosion. They have on one occasion even dumped all the snow that was between our fence and driveway onto my driveway and then left. Anytime we do something they have any semblance of an issue with they scream, cuss and as a result of their geriatric mouths with barely any teeth, spit on us in the process. I had planned to just keep ignoring it even though I know they keep coming onto our property to stare at their beloved fence that is approximately a foot away from our driveway/garage, but that's creepy.

Now here was the last straw for me. They posted these stupid signs at two points facing our driveway and at this point I feel like it's almost proof of them harassing me and definitely proof that they keep walking onto my property without permission, and I've flnally just reached my breaking point. Does anyone have any idea what I could do? I called our non emergency line and the cops basically said that the only thing we can do is get a restraining order or trespass them from our property. They also have decorated the front fence with one of those ""protected by the 2nd ammendment"" stickers that faces me every time I enter my driveway. I'm at a loss and was wondering if I could get any advice.

Lastly, yes the fence is behind their property lines, so I can't cite them for that.

Since I can't post an image, the sign is massive, red and reads 

""Absolutely no snow! No trespassing, no garbage, no yard debris, animals, mice or snakes. 

Any damage to property/fence is on you""

Thanks for your time."
229,229,"Can my employer install monitoring software on employee laptops and say it's ""anti-virus software""? California","My employer is requiring all employees to download a new program onto our computers. This program is a thinly veiled employee monitoring system that tracks our activity on our work computers. I know this is legal.

The problem is, my employer is pitching it as ""anti-virus software"". This is no disclosure in the official company email of what this software actually does and they're pretending it's for ""anti virus safety"". This is unprecedented at my company - never has my company required any type of tracking software and it's not mentioned in any policy documents that I'm aware of. My question is this:  Can my employer trick employees into installing monitoring software on their company laptops, without notifying employees of what it is they're installing?

230,230,Rent deposit not returned (32 days and counting),"Fiancée and I rented a house in Washoe County, Nevada. Due to some unknown and unresolved health hazards at the property that we were not responsible for (broken sewer line filling crawlspace with raw sewage), we were released of our lease by the rental agency and moved out. It's been over a month since our lease was terminated and we moved out, and we've not received any portion of our deposit or partial month rent refund (lease terminated mid-month).

What are our best options at this point? By NV law we are to get our funds within 30 days and/or a itemized written account for funds deducted. Do we keep waiting and requesting our funds, or go to small claims? I think the rental agency is located in Lyon County, so would we file there or in Washoe County?

Thank you in advance."

233,233,Legal advice,"Hi there, 
My son was stopped at the stop sign in the right lane at a two-lane intersection and the school bus driver was in the left lane. As my son slightly inched forward to try to see the road, (as the school bus was blocking his vision of oncoming traffic), the school bus turned right, and ran over the front left of my son's car. It is a brand new 2023 civic that was just purchased at the end of March. The bumper was hanging off and the car had to be towed. My son got a witness' name, and phone number, but when the police arrived, they weren't able to reach her. The kids on the bus were also saying that this is the second time the driver has hit a car in just a few months, and confirmed that the bus driver made a right turn from the left lane. The police officer said that they need to watch the school bus' camera footage, and that they would get back to us on Monday. What steps should we proceed with now? How can I make sure that all of the expenses of the accident are covered?"
234,234,Help navigating legal fees.,"So essentially, I just got my number back for a year long procedure over a car accident and it was a multi car —car accident. The attorney I have, is charging me her 33.3 % fee for both policies separately as opposed to combining the numbers and taking 33.3 percent from the whole pie. This is almost a $20,000 difference that she will get and does not make sense, since, even though they got the first payment $25,000 almost 6 months before the last $100,000–they waited to disburse the money and make sense of deductions and what not.

Is this customary or are they trying to get over?"

237,237,Fined for Service Dog on beach,"
Me and three of my friends went to a beach in Georgia, and one of my friends has a service dog for medical reasons. 

When we entered the beach, a sign said “no dogs, no smoking” etc, but we assumed since the dog is a medical service dog we would be fine. 

The dog had his vest on and was leashed until we set up our stuff, then all he had was a regular collar and an e-collar, which would vibrate and beep to contain/command him which was always held by someone, so he wasn’t unsupervised or not under control. He didn’t disturb anyone, we threw a frisbee for him a couple times, otherwise he just sat on our towels. Some people came up to him actually, but he minded his business.

Eventually one of the beach patrol guys came up to us, and told us someone called him about a “dog causing disturbance” and when we told him he was a medical service dog, he said he still had to ticket us for “dog at large” because he wasn’t leashed. He filled out a ticket, and got the address wrong, if that information helps. 

We wanted to know if we could/should fight it, since the dog didn’t disturb anyone, we have photo evidence of him wearing his e collar before the ticket, and he was doing his job. Can we?"
238,238,Child custody with mental disability (adhd) (California),"I could really use some legal advice, as me and my husband are arguing a bit back and fourth about this. My husband suffers from really bad Adhd - medication don't help - and anxiety, this is obviously a combo which makes it really hard for him to find work. Because of that I have been suggesting that he may plead his case and hopefully get disabled benefits, which would make his life a lot easier, however.. He believes that if he gets disabled benefits and gets accepted as unable to work, that he will lose all ability to have custody and hopefully full custody of his son some day. He is a very loving and attentive father, and he has never once made me doubt his abilities to be a father. Beside that he is marrying me in the start of May, and I got a stable job and somewhat high end sales degree, which I personally also believe counts towards custody, as it shows we are a stable household with a solid income and will be able to provide for the kid. Is there anyone who would be able to answer whether it really will matter in a custody case or not, as I personally think the judgment should be on the person's ability to take care of their kids, and not whether they are unable to work, but that is just my personal opinion ofcause, that doesn't mean the system is put together that way"

241,241,Friend needs to sell their house.,"Hello! This is happening in Arkansas. I have a friend whose mother died a few years ago, leaving themselves and their two siblings with the house she had owned outright. She was a hoarder and the house is in terrible condition, and my friend would not be able to afford to renovate it or live there as it is now. My friend is the only one of their siblings able to do anything with the house as their younger sibling is only 18 and their older sibling is an addict who they have not been able to make contact with in the years since their mom died. I really think selling their house is their best bet, but because they don't know how to deal with their situation, they haven't made any progress on selling it. My friend very briefly spoke to a real estate agent for advice right after their mother's death, but got discouraged when they were unable to find their older sibling.

My question is, how can they begin the process of selling this house without their oldest sibling around? Can they just start the process and hope he shows up? He has no permanent address or phone number, he doesn't work or have any social media presence, and the local police have not been able to help us in finding him either. The house is in their deceased mother's name, and as it was explained to me all three siblings would have to agree to the sale."
242,242,I need legal advice about harassment and stalking… I’m in California and the other person is in another state.,"My ex boyfriend has been harassing my husband. I don’t know the exact address or where my ex currently resides, I just know he’s in one of two states in mind. We have chosen not to talk to him. He’s made multiple social media accounts to try to friend my husband, emailed his work email, sent threatening letters to our house, and somehow got ahold of my husbands phone number and began texting him. He just sends old pictures of me and him to my husband and says dirty things and wants to talk to my husband and belittle him pretty much. He keeps implying that he wants to meet up with him and talk to him. We chose to block him and ignore all of his attempts to contact. The only thing we did was we sent a cease and desist letter via email since we don’t know where he physically resides. He still contacted us after the C&D letter. Any advice would be appreciated. My ex doesn’t have money so we don’t want to sue him (there’s nothing to gain) and we don’t really wanna see him get locked up, we just want the behavior to stop. He already has a sad life and we just want the best for him and to leave us alone. He’s just harassing my husband for no reason. It’s uncomfortable and annoying. I don’t know how he got ahold of my husbands phone number or work email and I know he’s a hacker. I’m not sure if he’ll ever have the audacity to show up at our front door. How can we protect ourselves? What can we do? We shouldn’t have to live the rest of our lives in fear. We had to completely wipe our names off Google and social media. I can’t shake off the thought of wanting to move but we don’t have the money to do that at the moment. I’m pretty much untraceable and he has not made attempts to contact me personally. I know he still has feelings for me obviously. I don’t want to live this way forever. I’m not sure what he’s capable of doing because I never saw this side of him before, but the way he’s acting and talking to my husband is concerning."

I live in new Jersey, Bergen county specifically.  Currently, my license is suspended and has been expired since 2019. I know, I know I should've gotten this taken care of when it happened all those years ago. 

Anyway, anytime I get pulled over the officer says My license is suspended and expired and I explain the situation: I have paid all the courts I owed money to, I don't have 12 or more points on my license, and I owe no money to any MVCs at all. When I ask the cop who pulls me over what courthouse I owe money to that's causing the suspension, they say nothing shows up. 

Next, I went on the DMVs website and it says I owe no restitution. So that's also a dead end. Finally, I got in contact with a lawyer who says there might be a debt owed that has been sent to a debt collector. I checked my credit, and nothing shows up. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who I owe money to, or if I owe money at all. I try to set up an appointment (because in NJ you need to) at the MVC, but the website said I can't because my license is expired. 

Again, this is 1000000000000% my own fuck up. I just need someone, literally anyone to tell me what I'm missing and how to fix this. I'm tired of bringing my fucking passport to bars when I need to show identification, I'm tired of not having a car in my name, and I'm tired of just not having the same freedom as any other New jersian.

246,246,Can my ex hide all our assets under an LLP so I don’t get half in our divorce?,"I am going through a divorce with my ex, we have two children, a mortgage, two car loans, and a good amount of stuff. As of this writing I have filled divorce but we’re still officially married. We’re in Texas.


Last fall, while we were married, he formed three companies: a LLP which owns a for-profit LLC which owns a non-profit LLC. According to the business structure, he and I each have a 1% stake in the LLP, and each of the LLCs own 49% stake in the LLP. My ex owns 100% of the for-profit LLC, which owns 100% of the non-profit LLC. There was no official legal counsel consulted for the formation of these companies; he got a Partnership Agreement template for the LLC from a LegalZoom equivalent. I do have a copy of that I can consult if questions arise.


He basically is trying to turn our “estate” into a business. He says the LLP owns our house and all our assets and liabilities. *He* and *I* don’t actually own anything, it’s all considered a depreciable asset of the LLP. According to his 2022 Annual Report, each of the 3 companies are considered a “Real Estate Investment Trust” and none of them have any tax due. He hasn’t done any business with the for-profit or non-profit LLCs, no clients, $0 in the business bank accounts.


If you check the public records for our home, only his and my names are on the deed of our house, not any of the companies.


He did a complete estate asset valuation table that included almost every item in our home that we own. I’ll mention, last spring we sold our first house and got a pretty hefty cash profit, about $80k of which went into a down payment and upgrades on our current house. The remaining $80k he pretty much unilaterally spent on STUFF. I wanted to invest, I tried to save, but he spent it, and more, putting us further in credit card debt. Our couples therapist heavily suspected Narcissistic Personality Disorder, that coupled with lots of other stuff led to me filing for divorce.


It was my understanding that in the divorce, I am entitled to half our community property, or realistically half the fair market value of our community property. Especially since he spent all our cash, we can’t afford our mortgage, car payments, and preschool tuition without his mom’s help, so all we really have is *stuff*.


I wrote up a proposal because we’re trying to settle out of court. I do have legal representation (I’m going to confer with him about this of course, but I want to be armed with all the info I can), but my ex is representing himself. We agree on custody entirely (50/50), and he didn’t seem to have an issue with the standard child support calculator. We mutually want a good-faith, inexpensive, efficient, out-of-court settlement.


Upon reading my proposal, he said I have NO claim to half the value of our assets because they’re owned by the LLP. I don’t think he has an issue physically giving me some stuff, but he doesn’t think he owes me half the fair market value of the community property he’s keeping. Is that legit? Everything I’ve read about hiding assets from divorce in LLCs is referencing LLCs formed PRIOR to marriage, where the assets wouldn’t be community property. He says I’m entitled to half the equity of our LLP, which is all our assets minus all our liabilities, which conveniently equals zero according to his valuations. 


I’m well over my head here, and trying not to be the victim of his mental/emotional/financial abuse anymore. If anyone has read this far and has input, I am so grateful."
247,247,Potential Job Offer Scam? (Personal Assistant),"Hey guys! I’m pretty worried about this situation so if you have the time to read & respond, I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you :)

For context, I (23 F) recently applied to a ton of jobs, including this remote personal assistant job for a guy who owns a hydraulics business. Because I was applying to so many jobs, I didn’t really check out this particular company’s website or even give them a Google Search (this was really dumb lol). 

A few days later, I received an email from the employer saying that I was chosen for an interview. However, the guy said he was too busy dealing with health issues to have a phone call interview, so he asked me questions via email. Upon finally searching for his company online, I wasn’t able to find an official website offering more information. I did, however, find one or two websites leading to an address & a phone number for the business, but that’s about it. After submitting my answers to the interview questions, I was offered the job. 

The employer said we would have the chance to talk (via phone or Zoom) next week regarding more details about the position. He also had me fill out a short letter with my personal information, including my name, address, phone number, and email. I filled out the letter and sent it back to him, along with some questions of my own regarding the job. 

My questions consisted of, “when do we start?” and “what’s the tentative work schedule?”. I also raised my concern about the lack of an official company website and asked for more information about the business itself. From the get-go, I had a gut feeling that this opportunity might be too good to be true, but a friend of mine reassured me by mentioning that his father owns a business and doesn’t have a website because all of his clients come from word of mouth. That, in itself, made me feel better and trust that this job opportunity could be real.

After I sent that email, he responded back without really answering any of my questions…Rather, he said that my first task was to deposit one of his business checks and donate the money to some foster homes to help children fight COVID-19. That check would also include my first week’s pay. At the end of the email, he wanted me to confirm that I had the ability to deposit a check. 

After I read that, it was the final red flag that lead me to searching up personal assistant scams online. I found out that it’s a legitimate thing and now I’m worried that something bad may happen because I was dumb enough to give him my personal information. My bank info and social security number were NOT given to him, so that makes me feel a bit safer, but I just don’t know.

Overall, my question is:

Did I just dodge a bullet? Is this actually a scam? Can my personal info be stolen and lead to identity theft? Or am I overthinking everything?

Thank you for your time."
248,248,USA/FL My friend’s dad left my friend a % of his house and small business. My friend no longer lives in the house (physical abuse) and the business was sold without his consent and he did not receive any money,"These are all the details I have for now as it’s very hard for him to talk about.

What kind of lawyer should he speak to, what kind of documents should he try to find, and are there any legal processes he should start?"
249,249,Can I sue a hospital for a botched hernia surgery in 2016?,"In 2016 I had a double strangulated hernia and had emergency surgery. The surgeon cut me open from right underneath my breasts to the very bottom of my torso. Obviously recovery was rough. Almost immediately after recovering, the hernia was back. They did not use any mesh and said they had just stitched it up. I am still dealing with it, basically look 600 months pregnant, and I’m so ashamed of it I don’t leave the house often. I know it’s been over six years since the surgery and I should have done something about it way back then, but I didn’t. But now I’m at the point where I’m so pissed off and I feel like my quality of life has been completely stolen from me. Can I still sue the hospital?"

251,251,Dog bite situation unlike others?,"Might be long but I’ll try to make it short

So I was bit by a dog in June of 2021 while I was working for a pesticide company by a customers dog. I didn’t really care to sue as long as the dog was caught up on shots which it was. 

The problem I had/have was the company said they would pay for all the medical bills and I filled out a form at the urgent care for that to be done.

Eventually I get a bill for $150ish from the urgent care, I tell my boss he says “bring it in we’ll send it to HR it’ll be taken care of”

Well this happened 3 more times and the last time I thought everything had been fine but today I get a letter from a debt collector for over $1000 from the urgent care. 

I contacted HR and they haven’t gotten back to me about it so I called the labor board of my state and filled out some forms.

I’m wondering if it would be something to let an attorney handle? I don’t really want anything other than the bill to be paid so it doesn’t affect my credit.

Any advice much appreciated"
252,252,"Mailbox has been removed and no one can tell me how, why, or where it’s at. PA","I live in a trailer park, the mailboxes are all provided by the park usually with 4 or 5 on a post. Sometimes the posts get pretty worn and they repair them which seems to be the case here, thing is mines just missing and not there. I noticed it was missing yesterday but I’m not sure how long it’s been gone. I called them at 11:30 today and explained the situation and they said they will look into it after lunch, I come home from work and it’s still not there, no call back and there’s no way to contact them until Monday. I not only had important mail inside, but other things like contacts I ordered. I’m almost positive whatever happen to it was from the repair done to the post, maybe they forgot to put it back? Maybe they lost it? I’m not really sure but that seems pretty negligent on there part.

Honestly I’m pretty easy going and not the type to start any kind of conflict, I’ve always been a good tenant and never had any problems before. But there’s new management and they just hit me with a 50$ fine for something totally unreasonable (that’s another story). Basically I want to tell them to kick rocks on the fine until I know what happen to my mailbox and I’m reimbursed for the things I ordered. I’ve taken pictures of the missing mailbox, I even recorded the call with management. Any help on how to continue this would be greatly appreciated"

254,254,Possible to execute a short sale and collect the insurance claim?,"I own a residential property in New York City that sustained significant water damage ($200k) that will be covered by my homeowners insurance. My mortgage balance is $500k and the property is worth $450k in it's current condition and have short sale buyers beating down my door prepared to pay cash. How can I execute a short sale (assuming Wells Fargo approves) and still collect my insurance claim? For those who haven't dealt with large insurance claims before, the money is not paid to the homeowner but rather the lender. The lender then releases 50% of the insurance settlement to the homeowner to begin work then the remaining 50% once the work is complete OR the home has been sold. My thinking is why wouldn't I collect the initial 50%, negotiate and execute the short sale, then provide proof the home was sold thus having the remaining 50% released to me? It seems like a lot of work but there is 100s of thousands of dollars at stake."

256,256,Landlord hasn’t found a permanent fix to our HVAC system,"Hi all. I’m in NYC. Upon moving into a new place late Dec, my roommate made me aware that the HVAC system in the whole building was broken, so until they fixed it, we’d be using the space heaters the landlord provided for us. 

it was fine for a few weeks. then someone came and fixed the HVAC system in the building, only my apartment remained without heat. My roommate said this has happened before, so she reached out and eventually they came to look at it. 

I was actually home for a good portion of January, but my roommate says it was broken that whole time. They came back the beginning of Feb to fix it, and it remained fixed for only about two weeks. On February 22nd I reached out to have someone come fix it again. 

That is last time I can remember the HVAC was half working. Since Feb, it’s been back and forth with the landlord trying to have someone come fix it. I’ve been here since late December, and the HVAC has worked for only a total of about 3-4 weeks of that time. 

After begging, someone finally showed up and fixed the damn thing today. So i made it through winter without it working. 

my question is, Am I really forced to pay for the heating and cooling costs in my rent if it was broken this entire time? am i SOL? Or is it at least worth the shot to try to get some compensation for this?"
257,257,I got paid recently and noticed my check was about 1/3 of what I should have gotten.,"I work at a restaurant as a server so I make 2.13 an hour plus tips. I worked 62 hours (about 13 shifts in a 2 week pay period) and my check before taxes was only $1100. $430 was from tip share (I work as a bartender a few shifts a week so I get tip share from severs). That part made sense. The part that doesn’t make sense is the tips on my check. The check said I made $550 in tips in two weeks. I make that in 2 days. Every shift I make at least $100, with some shifts being $250-$350. 

My last check was suspiciously low but I chalked it up to me missing a few shifts plus training shifts at the bar. But now I think my last check was way under too. I told my GM and my other manager and they even said that doesn’t add up. They said they contacted corporate yesterday and they are looking over my checkouts with all my tips for the last month. I worked there 4 years and I never had this happen until I started training as a bartender a few weeks ago. My guess is that it was an honest mistake because of how I put in my tips. I’m supposed to be clocked in under “bartender” but corporate has not given me the button to clock in as such. So whenever I’ve been bartending, I clock in under “greeter” because I would get tipshare under this button as well. The way tipshare is distributed works like this: for each week they collect all tipshare from servers and to-go tips from greeters and split it up evenly amongst all the greeters and bartenders. So if you worked more hours that week, you got a bigger share. So since I’ve been putting my tips under my greeter number, they might have distributed my tips to everyone.

I guess my question is, is there a certain time frame they need to pay the rest of what I’m owed (if it does turn out they underpaid me)? My rent is tomorrow (Ik, it’s in the middle of the month) and $900 in downtown Dallas is not enough to get by. 

My other question I have is do I need to report this? Or should I wait for their response? What if they claim I was not underpaid? What should I do then?

Final question, would they need to compensate me more if it takes them a long time to send the rest of my paycheck to me?"
258,258,TX - Update on gamestop giving my PS5 to a thief.,"I called the corporate line like most of you suggested. Thanks for that. Also F you for that. Holy hell that line was the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. Including comcast. 

Anyways. After being transferred from India to China to Taiwan and then to Malaysia. Or just 3 different departments whom had no clue what the hell was going on. Seriously… Warm transfers anyone? I finally got on the phone with someone who mattered. I had to send the video from my phone to them, but they finally agreed that the store screwed up. They gave me a replacement right away.  They asked if the same store was a good place to pick up the unit, I said yes and they gave me some instructions for the supervisor there. 

Get to the store and new employees are there. Manager I talked with had been hired yesterday so apparently this was bad enough for the previous people to be gone. Either that or they just hired a new manager. He had to make 3 phone calls to get the transaction processed. Its like they hired a kid off the street and didn’t train them. Either way doesn’t matter to me. Ill never be back to gamestop ever.  

I get the unit home and noticed it was the disk version. At that point I no longer cared that it was an upgrade. I was done and never wanted to go through this process again. I just spent the day transferring his ps4 games to his ps5. 

Side note. The guy who stole the ps5 got caught. The manager realized the situation halfway through and told me they caught the guy. Said he did it to several gamestops and got caught in the act at one of them."
259,259,Breaking my lease because my apartment is making me ill,"Okay I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but if anyone could help me get some guidance on this? I live in an apartment in NYC, and one of my roommates kinda went off his rocker. He's been chain smoking cigars and weed in the living room and blaring loud music, and gets super aggressive when anyone (particularly women) tell him to stop or at least do all that in his room. It got so bad that my last roommate moved out because of it, complaining to the landlord after she did so. I have a horrible chronic nausea problem and basically haven't been able to live or sleep in my own apartment for months. I emailed my landlord like two weeks ago with evidence, first asking if I could see the smoking policy which they were required by law to have (they couldn't provide me with one), then emailing them about the situation, (they told me they'd reach out after the weekend) then emailing them again when no one got back to me. I'm really just wanting to break my lease because I can't afford this much money for a glorified storage unit at this point. My question is, what could I be liable for if I did this? I know most places require that you find a replacement, but I couldn't even show the place to a prospective tenant to replace the roommate that moved, because he had trashed it and was shitting with the bathroom door open when I came in, then got aggressive when I asked him to close it. I'm already a month behind on rent and am trying to scrape by to pay it off, and it feels ridiculous to be doing all of this for a place I can't even live in. I also know for a fact that if they send the roommate a written notice to stop, he won't even read it much less follow it. How the fuck do I get out of this place?"
260,260,"Legal advice about medical practices, Georgia, USA","I had a visit with my primary care doctor yesterday, morning. It was the usual follow up talking about my current condition and get medications refilled. During the visit the doctor asked me about my right arm surgery. The way the conversation went was like him telling me to not take the medication for the surgery. I tried telling the surgery was part of the solution, but I had neuropathy since this injury in high school. But every time I tried telling the doctor about the issue I had previously, he stops me and I think he said something like be careful not to take the med for the wrong reason. Then we finished the conversation with him telling me, he'll see me in a few months and get my blood and urine sample. 

&#x200B;

So I left and went home,  I looked at my medication refill and there was only that was being refilled, but not the other. I called the doctor's office, the nurse tells me it was sent and pending in kroger's system. So I said ok please give me a call when it does get refilled (at this point I was out of the medication for over a week). 

When they called me back, the nurse tells me the doctor had concerns about the potential of the medication and he stopped it. I was like what do you mean? shouldn't you at least discuss a treatment plan with me, before you do that? She was like oh, do you still need the medication? I said yes, I do I have been out of medication for over a week and my nerve has been flaring up and my hand is going numb. So she was like I will give the doctor your message and get back to you. 

So I waited and as I waited, I thought there might've been a miscommunication with the doctor, so I wrote him a message and submitted a refill request through their patient portal. Then we played a game of phone tag. The next time they called back, they changed their story and said the doctor wants me to see a neurologist, I was like ok that's fine. Even though I don't have insurance moment, but that's not a problem. You can't just cut off my medication without consulting me and come up with a treatment plan. I was never told my medication is gone during the visit, that is extremely unprofessional and it feels like this ethics violation. 

Obviously the nurse couldn't answer back on those, then the conversation becomes we can give you referrals and give you finance assistance application for xxxx hospital. I was like ok that's fine I'll take it, but what about in the meanwhile? 

&#x200B;

I asked her if she knew how the approval of thhe apllication was? She goes no I don't it depends on the case. So I was like ok, you don't know and you cut off my medication without consulting me or give me adequate notice. That is not right, you need to give me medication for the meantime at least. So she goes well ok I'll call the pharmacy and try to give you 2 weeks. I'm like is that the average time for finance assistance approval? Again, she doesn't know. So I said you need to give at least a month. So she and I went back and forth, it ended with her telling me she will call pharmacy to give a month. 

After that she called again, to tell me I had a refill left on my medication so she called that in. I told her no I don't I just checked my medication. She insisted there was and that I can pick it up today. She wasn't happy on and just fudge the call, it was cut in and out at that point. 

So I waited til tomorrow checked my medication again, there was a refill request from the pharmacy to them. So I called them back and told them, there is no refill left. Then the nurse was irritated and finally called the pharmcy to give me a one month refill. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: the doctor cut off my medication without consulting me, the nurses tried to cover for the doctor by making up excuse and changing their story about: doctor wanting me to prove my condition. 

&#x200B;

TLDR2: I've seen this doctor for the last 4 years whether I had insurance or not. I've always talked about condition and the history of it. I've never had any altercation with this doctor. 

&#x200B;

So I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse for actions like this? I've met a lot of terrible doctors, since I moved to Georgia. Not only are they unprofessional, they just don't have any ethics at all. It's like patients are just burgers. This feels very unprofessional and gotta violate some kind of doctor's ethics."
261,261,My wife’s teeth saga,"First time poster, long time creeper of the sub. This is a long story but I will keep it as short as I can.  

My (35M) beautiful wife (35F) has had a lot of dental issues since she was a small child. In 2016 she had to go see a dentist because of immense pain. That dentist determined she needed 9 root canals and other major work done. This dentist then also presented the option of the “All on 4” procedure but we needed to be referred to an oral surgeon for this. In the visit with the oral surgeon we leaded that this meant pulling all of her teeth (instead of all the root canals etc.) and then he would be doing implants into the jaw bones. She needed the top and bottom of her mouth done so 8 total implants. We were quoted $40k for the procedure and not something dental insurance would cover. We leave the consultation disheartened and not knowing what we would need to do. 

My wife then receives a call from the initial dentist and is asked to be in a commercial that the dentist and oral surgeon were going to partner and both use and they would do the procedure for $10k. This also supposedly included lifetime aftercare and we decide to proceed with the procedure.

This began in 2016 and was not completed until 2017. She had the initial implant procedure done by the oral surgeon which was a fairly big ordeal and after waiting for the swelling to go down the dentist is then to begin to make the denture that is to be attached to the implants. This is also a lengthy process with many appointments and breaks and other mishaps with the teeth/denture. She finally gets the final permanent teeth in and we think everything is good to go. The dentist discharges her and says to call if there is ever a problem. There were some breaks and things and at one point the top denture broke and her front 3 teeth were out she was embarrassed as it happened at a family weekend event and she wound up using a denture repair kit to get them reattached herself. Everything was mostly fine for some years. 

We are now caught up to present day and the issue I would love some advice on. She woke up one morning 3 weeks ago and the bottom denture had totally become detached from the implant posts. We have had 2 dentist tell us there is no way this should’ve happened. We go back to the office of the dentist as this is what she has been told to do but that specific dentist is no longer employed there and is uncontactable according to them. After 2 appointments we learn that nobody working there is familiar with the procedure or even knows where the toolkit to take the screws out of the dentures or anything we basically leave with them telling us they will try to figure something out but we had better look for someone else to help her. We have since found another office that has been wonderful. The parts were ordered today to put her bottom denture back on and after this long she is finally back on the way to being able to eat solid food so that is good. We’ve also learned the first dentist caused several issues such as the shape of the denture is not correct which has led to her having a small gap that can collect food and has accelerated some bone loss around the implants and she needs to have a new set made which will cost $26k. The agreement was that the first dentist would be providing these services for life but they are now unable to causing us to need to find a way to pay the 26k as there really isn’t any other option. Does this sound like we should have any personal injury legal recourse?"
262,262,Advice,"I had got into a car accident over two years ago, where there was a court date I attended to and pled guilty. The plaintiff, that I had hit never showed up to the court date.

263,263,House Issue," 

I live with my dad and family in a shared ownership house under him, his brother and sister. The house was bought by my grandfather. My dad was given power of attorney by his parents and unfortunately he lost the documents. We called the law firm which was merged a while back and they have no records of it anymore. Document was in early 80’s. Is there any way to request a document preferably original copy? If yes, where do we go? Already asked the law firm and there’s been no help. Also, the guy from their law company who wrote the power of attorney sadly passed away years back and there is no electronic copy of the document. 

Main issue is my dad’s sister (aunt) wants her share but we can’t afford to give her the sum as it’s too much and we have no other house to stay other than this and for this reason my dad (retired) doesn’t want to sell it. She already has a big house and lives with her family. If I had enough money I would have given her the share. I believe she is thinking of taking us to court. What are the options in court? What can she do since power of attorney belongs to my father. What would happen to power of attorney once my dad’s gone? Is there a way to transfer power of attorney to me and will it be valid after he’s gone?

In summary I’m looking at legal actions we can save the house from selling? Will the power of attorney save us from court? As an evidence, do we need power of attorney document? If possible please advise other options for this crisis? What would be the best scenario and what can worse happen in this situation? Again, we are not in a position at the moment to give her house share in money.

Thanks"
264,264,Mold issue,"Mold issue

I rent an apt in Central CA (SC County) and I noticed a square of discoloration in December - when an agent from my realtor showed up to fix the fire alarm, we showed him the square and he just told us to clean it and move along. We had a very rainy DJF and the problem became much more prevalent despite our attempts to clean. We sent a formal notice in late February to ask them to fix the issue but their response was just “clean it with a solution and keep the area dry”. It has been 6 weeks since the initial notice and now that we threatened legal action they decided to send an inspector for the mold to determine which kind. What would we as tenants be entitled to and/or would we be able to break lease due to “implied warrant of habitability” or can they just come and fix and nothing more? Thank you.


I can’t post images but the main size of the mold is about a square foot above a bedroom door and maybe 3 sq feet behind the closet doors"
265,265,Seeking legal info on divorce and house.," Info- husband and i met in 2016, in 2017 we house shopped, He bought the house, i signed nothing, we have a 3 year old and have been married since 2018. We live in Arizona. 

 I may be filing for divorce, what legal grounds do i have on the house?  Am i entitled to half?  He has always refused to let me contribute to bills. He pays the house, and household bills.  I pay our childcare and our cell phones.  I pay for 95% of our kids needs. I have payed for a new shower remodel (7k) and new built ins framing the fireplace for 5k.  He payed for the new flooring upstairs.  

So i have somewhat contributed to our home exspenses but not in a traditional split of bills. 

Income wise, i make roughly 55k annually, he makes around 50k and gets roughly 30k in disability annually.  

He uses the house in fights and tells me to get the fuck out of his house. Its very frustrating,  and he threatens to throw me out. He is also suicidal and severly depressed and has severe PTSD. 
I am at my wits end because he is emotionally abussive, and quite scary at times."
266,266,"Moving out of a rental property before the end of the lease Chicago, IL","Hi all, I was hoping to ask for some advice about renting in Chicago, IL if anyone knows some more about these rules. 

My 2 roommates have lived in this apartment since August 2021 and I moved in August 2022- when we signed a joint lease contract with all of our names on it. However due to a lot of issues with the roommates, including them going through my things when I am not home, I am trying to move out as quickly as I can and just signed a new lease to start May 1.  This is 3 months before the end of my current lease at the end of July. I was advised to look over the Residential Landlord and Tenant Ordinance to see about the security deposit/ rent for the 3 months after I vacate the unit and turn in my keys. This is where I have my question, does the re-rental section apply to me? This part: “the landlord shall make a good faith effort to re-rent the tenant's dwelling unit at a fair rental, which shall be the rent charged for comparable dwelling units in the premises or in the same neighborhood.” 

I know some people who have been able to avoid paying the additional rent for the months they didn’t live in the unit, but they didn’t have roommates. My plan was just to pay the 3 months rent up front, ask the landlord to do a walkthrough of my room/ common areas, and request my portion of the security deposit be paid to me directly. However, if I am able to avoid paying 2 rents for May- July that would be ideal, but I don’t know if that still works with all of us on the same lease.

Any advice you may have would be appreciated, Thanks in advance!"

Today I got a call saying they're replacing the carpet in the apartment and now don't want to let me have a pet for ""at least the first year"" due to new carpet.

269,269,"Husband's W4 was changed January 2022, not by him.","It was discovered while filing our taxes that my husband didn't have enough federal withholdings taken out of his check during 2022.  We both have our W4s as married filing jointly, but do not include our kids. I know we're giving the government a loan, but it's better than paying and we've always had a refund.  We started digging into what happened because it's a pretty substantial tax bill we owe now, and no one can find the supporting documentation of the W4 or why his changed. His company changed to a payroll company around the time that the update occurred and they've been of no help.
Steps we've taken so far:
1) Requested a copy of the W4 from the payroll company, but they said they couldn't supply it.  Said they couldn't give it, because he was terminated (he wasn't, his company just switched payroll companies again).
2) Requested it from HR at the home office and no one can find it there. 
3) Requested an audit trail from the payroll company and they could only provide the date it was changed and that the change came from my husband's company.
4) Contacted the former HR employee that would have handled any of those details at that time before they left, and they gave a file location where those changes were documented.  Reached back out to HR at the company now and no one has ""access"" to the files because they're digital and setup before any of them started.

Question is, do we have any recourse for this?  We don't remember making the change or authorizing it, and the lack of his company being able to supply the W4 is raising red flags for us.  We've since corrected his W4 and will be monitoring his paychecks going forward for the Federal withheld, but is there anything we can do to get back some of the thousands that should have been withheld?  I know the tax has to be paid, and not disputing that, I just feel like his company should have some skin in the game since this occurred because of an apparent error on their side.  This all happened in VA USA."

272,272,My apartment complex has given me a final statement for all move out fees my security deposit doesn’t cover. Some of them don’t make sense. (TX),"Hello, all. First time poster on this subreddit. Please let me know if you need any more information.

So, first part. We have a few $10 for dirty things. So, the ceiling fan in one of the rooms, the oven, the toilet in of the bathrooms, and the dishwasher. Would that not qualify as normal wear and tear that we aren’t responsible for? We did clean all these things except the ceiling fan so I guess we just didn’t clean to their satisfaction? 

Next, they’re replacing the living room blinds ($148) even though they were fully functional with all blinds in tact. I do not have a photo proving that however.

Next, they’re replacing the kitchen vinyl ($355). They did not include a reason why. I’m also not sure if that’s the countertops or the flooring. They did not clarify, but both were clean so I’m not sure why they’d need replacing.

Next, they’re replacing the carpet ($1,345). This one is the only one I can understand, but also the one I’m most worried about as I do not have $1,345. There was a green stain (darn McDonalds Shamrock shake) about 6x6 inches in the main bedroom and carpet all throughout the apartment. It just says they’re charging for carpet replacement, it does not clarify if that’s for the entire apartment. There was mold all throughout the second bedroom because our upstairs neighbors A/C system leaked. We reported it to management, but they never fixed it. So most likely there was mold damage to the carpet in that bedroom.

They are also charging for resurfacing of the bathtub ($225), but that’s because there is hair dye stains all over it so I’m not here to dispute that charge. 

I just need help going through these charges, because $2113 is a ton of money and I want to make sure they’re all legitimate. Let me know if you need more information and please help."

During our divorce we both waived rights to child support from one another, but my fiance is a doctor and makes leagues more than my ex and I put together.

274,274,Damaged Furniture + credit card dispute dismissed on forgery,"Need some advice on dealing with furniture company and credit card company. 

Can I pursue this in court considering 

(1) they committed signature forgery, 

(2) didn’t provide all the services I paid for (white glove delivery) and quality of product I paid for 

(3) credit card company dismissed a dispute based on falsified documents. 

Background (1-3) Problem (4-5)

1. Delivery window: 
Delivery was split into two shipments. estimated delivery date was not confirmed for weeks until delivery for each shipment was suddenly notified the day before. 

2. Delivery Team:
White glove delivery option was purchased. Delivery team was hostile (to the point of intimidation),and refused to wear shoe covers when setting up furniture in bedroom. Furniture assembly was not complete for all items. Delivery team did not even seem to care. 

3. Furniture condition:
Furniture was damaged either from warehouse and/or during set up (as delivery team tended to be quite careless) 

4. Service/Support:
Shocked at every step, filed a claim with 1StopBedrooms and my representative did not seem to care nor was surprised. They offered $150 credit for a $4,000 order. I refused. They make refund process difficult and a financial loss (horrible customer policies). You have to pay for return shipping by the weight for example. Even more difficult if you purchased white glove service as the team takes back the furniture packaging. 1StopBedrooms still has not provided repair support that they claim they will do. It’s been three months since delivery. 

5. Fraudulent:
I filed a credit card claim to recoup some of my losses. Credit card company dismissed dispute showing me Merchant (1StopBedrooms) provided documentation that I acknowledged receiving furniture in good condition. Imagine my shock when I saw this document had a FORGED signature (I was OUT OF STATE at the time of this delivery.) How is this a real business with that many good reviews?!?!
Credit card company dismissed the redispute when I provided documentation (that I wasn’t allowed to uploaded in the first place) “because the window expired”. 
I don’t know how a credit card company accepts they made a decision based on falsified documents. 

Thank you!! 🙏

Edit: 
1) this happened in California
2) the headache this has caused me for months makes me want to give up but I’m so appalled I need them to know they can’t just do this to people!! The furniture set was for my parents and they are very saddened by this."

276,276,Is it illegal to say that you own a home when you don’t,Hey there this may be odd but I had an old man who is presumably the neighbor to the home I tried to visit come up to me and tell me that he is in fact the owner of the home I was trying to visit and to go away. So I did some background checks and find out he is not the home owner whatsoever and in fact lives next door as his main place of residency. So I went back and he stopped me again and said he told me to leave and that he is the owner so I asked if I could please see a bill associated with the address to prove he is at least affiliated with the home in some kind of way and he told me he doesn’t have to show me anything and that I need to leave or else he will call the cops. Now I do know that when someone tells you to leave and you visit that property again it is criminal trespassing but what if it isn’t his property? My work is not government work but I do have my permits and licensing in order and I am allowed to be there and in that area doing what I need to do. Any advice? Does this count as fraudulent activity for the neighbor?
277,277,Past Abuse?,"I just have a question.

I grew up in Minnesota and when I was a child I was molested by my cousin. I am now 23. I just looked up info about statue of limitations in Minnesota and found out a few years ago they changed the law and made it so there wasn't a statue of limitations for CSA anymore. But I have no idea how to go about reporting what happened.. it was so long ago I don't even know how to go about this. It has severely affected my mental health as I have grown and I have only just started healing. I don't even know if I CAN report it because I don't remember exact details of the year or how old I was. (Under 10 for sure). Is it even worth trying? 

He has a daughter now and it just disgusts me.. I don't know what to do. I want to do something.. I should have done something years ago but by the time I realized fully what happened and how it was wrong I felt like it was too late to do anything.. I don't know what to do or even what I can do and google isn't really helping. So any advice or anything would be really appreciated.

278,278,Not paying work-shift related fines after moving out of cooperative housing enviroment.,"My contract for a 2-bedroom appt as part of a cooperative housing organization ends next month, after which I will be moving out of state. While I am planning to pay all rent owed, I owe additional money because I did not perform workshift obligations to my appt complex. Here is the section of my housing contract on workshift:

""Each Member is obligated to perform faithfully and as efficiently as possible all work assigned under the workshift system as part of the consideration in exchange for this contract. Any work performed under the workshift system shall be considered an obligation of membership inherent in cooperative living. Failure to perform workshift shall be grounds for termination of membership under Article 13, and a breach of contract by Member according to Article 8. Member agrees to pay the unit for the reasonable value of any workshift hours not performed as outlined in BSC and unit-level Workshift Policies.""

I was prepared to owe pay for 10 hours of missed workshift (about 200$). However, my appt complex uses a highly predatory structure which was not mentioned in my housing contract where missed workshift hours accumulate and are doubled after each pay period. I am now on the hook for over 1000$ in missed workshift fines.

I was wondering what the legal repercussions could be if I refused to pay these workshift related charges, while still paying the rent that is owed?"

I came back to a house that I am doing partial labour for and partial cash payment for, for rent. I do not have a lease. Nobody can take my ESA and I was told he has to be off property or it's a 'dealbreaker' which I'm assuming means I'd have to go back on the street. This is a Catholic church and a separated housing from the church itself owned by the Father. He has even said that church stays at church and this and housing is separate.

282,282,"My gf's grandpa passed. After his girlfriend was evicted, she sold many of his items and trashed the house.","Her grandpa did not have a will but, after going through everything, the court ruled that my gf's mom legally owned the house and my gf could legally own his car. Grandpa's girlfriend of 20-ish years showed up late to court for the eviction and was told she owed my gf's mom 300-400 dollars. She told the judge she refuses to pay it and that she moved out a month ago into the neighbor's house.

After court she went back to the house, moved the car into the backyard, and broke a random key in the ignition after shutting it off. She also sold a lot of the valuable items in the house and completely trashed the place. The house isn't very expensive, but it's still going to require a lot more time to fix up.

I went over there with my gf and her mom today and saw the state of the house. We didn't even know she tampered with the car until I tried starting it with the key we had, took me 20-30 minutes to fish out the tip of the key from the ignition.

There must be some sort of small claims legal procedure we can follow through for this, but I'm only 20 so I have no idea how to do it. She completely wasted our time and doesn't care at all."
283,283,was sent a general release document," 

Hi r/legaladvice,

I recently moved out of my apartment two weeks ago and have been waiting to receive my security deposit back. Today, I was sent a legal document via email, and I am having trouble understanding exactly what it means. I am hoping someone here can help clarify the purpose and implications of this document.

The document appears to be a General Release, where I, as the Releasor, acknowledge receiving valuable consideration from my former landlord (the Releasee). The document states that I am releasing the landlord and associated parties from any legal claims or disputes that may have arisen from the past until the date of the document, specifically mentioning a Residential Lease for the apartment I used to live in. It also states that upon signing this release, the Releasee will return my security deposit in the amount of $1,000.00.

To summarize, I moved out of the apartment two weeks ago and have not yet received my security deposit. This document was sent to me via email, and I am unsure if I should sign it or if there are potential legal ramifications I should be aware of before doing so.

Any help with understanding this document and what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
284,284,Artist scammed by “art show” - help?,"A family of member of mine is an artist, and recently applied to and was accepted into an art show in NYC. There was a hefty $500 fee to be a part of the show. 

Of course that sounds like a red flag now, but this museum has been putting on legitimate shows since 2020. She also spoke with numerous artists who showed their work with them, so she was confident that this was a real show. 

Flash forward to the day of the show. She shows up to set up her work, and it’s completely closed down. She meets up with the other artists, and some say they’ve been trying to get in contact with the gallery for days to no avail. 

It appears they have shut down phone line, though their website is still up. No one can get in contact with them.  Some artists mailed their art to the gallery, and it seems unlikely they’ll get it back. 

Whether it was all an elaborate scam, or if the company suddenly shut down and ghosted them is unclear. Either way, she’s out $500, plus the cost of traveling to and from NYC for the show. 

What should she do, legal-wise? How can she report this? Is there any way for her to get her $500 back?"
285,285,Dealership Service Center Damaged Part That I Now Have to Pay For,"So I took my car to a dealership service center, where I used to live, back in January of 2021 because I was having an issue. The technician stated that he believed he had repaired the problematic component, but advised that if the issue returned then he would recommend replacing the component entirely. Fast forward to now, and the same exact issue has returned again, leading me to suspect the issue is the exact same as what it was when it was last diagnosed by the original service center. I now live somehwere else, so I took my car to the service center local to me, and they are stating that the bolt that holds the component that needs to replaced on, is stripped and has damaged an additional connector that it's attached to, meaning I'm going to have to replace an additional component, which I was not expecting to have to replace. This component is the same component that the original dealership's technician disassembled and reassembled, meaning they are the only one that could have stripped the bolt and damaged the component and the additional connector during their process of reassembling the component when they worked on it. My question is if I have any legal basis here to make them pay for the damaged component that resulted in the additional connector also becoming damaged, when it wasnt damaged before they serviced it? I tried reaching out to the original service center that actually caused the damage and they just kept giving me the run around and putting me on hold/transferring me to different people without answering any questions whatsoever."
286,286,Just won my arbitration. Looking for advice.,"I was unfairly fired from my job last year.  I went through the usual channels through my union and ended up having to arbitrate. I just found out I have won my case and my employer has been ordered to immediately reinstate me. I am to be made whole. I get my position back, along with seniority, benefits, and back pay. Here's what I want to know: Would I be in any sort of violation if I quite after receiving the back pay, and will need to pay it back? There's nothing in the arbitration document saying I have to work any length of time, or any other stipulation for me. I just don't know if there are any laws that govern that sort of situation. If so, what's a good length of time to work before getting out of there?  I decided I no longer wanted to work for them after the stints (there were several) they pulled against me, in addition to the company going downhill since I've been gone (terrible working conditions, unfair treatment, etc.). Our union isn't the strongest and is overwhelmed with the number of issues they're trying to handle, so the company has been taking advantage. I'm not sure I'm going to want to stay very long, but will give it a try. I just want to make sure my money will stay with me if I decide I don't wish to stay. This is in NYS, btw. Thanks."

The date that they were originally told was the date that she was going to jail wound up being just a sentencing hearing. Then a bunch of other shit happened and she finally went to jail, but it's only going to be for 2 weeks.

288,288,Grandmother Selling Car with Will Stating She is Executrix of Grandfather's Will,"My grandfather passed away about 3 weeks ago and had a new car that is valued around \~43k. He left a will that states my grandmother is the executrix of the will. They held a joint checking account but she took his name off the account soon after he died (this was a mistake it seems). I have reached out to multiple car dealerships and car buying services (AutoNation, CarMax) but they can only make out the title to my deceased grandfather, as the title is in his name. However, she isn't able to cash any check in his name because his name was taken off of the account.  


It seems that although she has the will, she will also need a letters testementary to be able to either open an estate account or have the title moved over to her. This would probably involve getting a probate lawyer involved as I don't know how to fill out all the forms and neither does she.  


Is there any way to sell the car to some kind of private buyer (I.E. craigslist or something) that doesn't involve changing over the title to her name, but would allow the check to be made out to her?"
289,289,Florida Probate Question(Affidavit of Heirs),"Last month I filed a Summary Administration for my grandmother's estate. Yesterday I got a letter outlining 6 issues that needed correcting. All fairly simple such as 'place of death' I put the hospital name, as I had seen in all the sample documents I used as reference, but apparently I had to include city and state as well. The only one which gives me pause is, ""Petitioner failed to file an affidavit of heirs listing all the heirs of the decedent who would be entitled to inherit the decedent's property"". No husband, and 3 kids all alive. For grandparents I put ""none"" as they died 100 years ago and I knew nothing about them and for aunts/uncles I did the same because there are 13 of them all deceased, I don't know the dates of their deaths which would be required. I looked up her mother's obituary and found the grandparents names and years of death. I can probably get some of the information on the aunts/uncles but would they that just lead to me waiting a month to get the same notice, or are the under the impression she has more kids. I'm just really confused."

During this whole process I have also been in contact with my case manager from my works HR department and she said she can’t get a hold of the job accommodation people either?  How’s that possible. I’ve turned in all the required  accommodations documents  and they’ve all been signed by my doctor and submitted in February.. I work for a bigger company so I’m confused on why the process is so difficult. I’ve gave them more than enough time to put a accomodation in for me when I return back to work.

What do I do from here?

HR department is separate from work accomodation department and HR can’t reach them either. Supervisor hasn’t heard anything from work accomodation department.

Leaving me (19 M) at the time head of household due to mother not being able to work at that time. Fast forward to hurricane Harvey, flooded my entire neighborhood and destroying all of our materialistic items. No fema help, no life insurance from dad, overall horrible situation. 
Update as of today, the city said no one can move back into the flood zone or rebuild, and will buy everyone out. They have purchased a lot of properties plus a relocation bonus. 
Our situation apparently is different? 
Because the house was in my deceased fathers name, they refuse to pay my mother and buy her out. Even though she shows the death certificate and marriage certificate apparently that isn’t enough? 
They say we need to get with the title company and city attorney to have the deed switched over to my mothers name to be bought out. 
My opinion is I think they’re bullshiting my mother, and she’s not a confrontational person. My parents got taken advantage of all the time growing up because they are just way too nice which made me grow up the asshole to balance the family in a sense. My gut is telling me that a marriage certificate and death certificate should be more than enough to finish this process and get my mother paid what she deserves. I have the number to the city attorney but decided to jump on here and get some feedback before I jump in blind and look like a fool.
Any input would be helpful and appreciated"

My apartment was in upstate New York, not New York City. I'm not sure if this was a NYC only law or for all of New York State.

What I'm reading, it says it applies if you rented an apartment on or after July 2019. I initially moved in back in 2015 and renewed the lease annually. I was also on a month to month for the last 3 years.  

My landlord provided a page for move-out instructions with the original lease which the landlord also forwarded me at move-out. It says they would send the security deposit within 45 days of move out. Does that mean I have to wait 45 days?

I moved out 20 days ago.

I had it planned out that I would transfer my existing lease to a friend and move out mid of month. However, when I submitted a request to transfer lease, Medallion just sent a generic letter stating your request has not been approved. I've simultaneously asked them to terminate my lease mid of month to which they verbally declined and said I need to complete/pay for the whole month of June which is a big financial obligation on me. Since my lease transfer is not approved, can I just give N9 and leave on 17th of June?

* Is this generic letter enough to prove that the landlord refused to allow the tenant to assign the rental unit?
* Would it matter if I give N9 now with end date of 17th June or does this clause not hold if 30 days of receiving the non-approval letter have passed?
* I have already given a last month rent when I signed up the lease, will I be given back my amount for the duration of June 18 - June 30?

My parents put it in before they passed and made me the beneficiary but I have no control over any of the assets becauses the trustees are out of country. The trust says the assets won't be given over to me for another 10 years. 

So currently I am stuck paying for the expenses of the house that I don't want to be in. I can't move and rent it out because there are a lot of assets in the trust if the tenent tries and sue. 

I been looking to buy a new place but don""t qualify for 1st time homebuyer program since I am the trust beneficiary. Also my loan applications been stalled because banks not sure  how to deal with the trust.

309,309,"Squatter, Rats, Ants, Beneath house we just started renting","My pregnant girlfriend and I just moved in and started renting a new duplex 2 weeks ago, it is 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, all for 2100$ in a pretty expensive area, sounds like a great deal! 
We asked them if the house had any prior issues, anything to keep an eye out for, any complaints the previous tenants had, which they responded saying no, and that everything is all up to standard with no ongoing issues.
Little did we know there is a massive ant infestation in the sideboards, in the floor, noisy neighbors, and below us resides a locked off basement which had supposedly not been opened in years and (*has no issues*) until we over 2 weeks have had multiple ant hives come out under our floors, the smell of feces come through the floor, disgusting dust come out, which the pest control treated our floor and outside multiple times over these two week but ants keep coming out.
Once this basement was opened, there resided
-Human Feces
-Food Bags
-Ant Hives
-Rotting wood
-Rat nests
-All insulation falling onto the ground
-Insulation not covered from our floor above meaning that insulation was in the air
-Rat feces in the insulation
-A piece of wood was all that was closing off this basement meaning a squatter has been in and out of this basement over this period of time

Mind you, they told us there was no issues with this unit or anything in regard to it, which is obviously a lie, we werent even told that a week prior to us moving in, pest control had to treat the unit.


If there is anybody at all that can give us some insight on what we can do about this, or what legal measures we can take, please i would appreciate it very much."
310,310,Was offered an apartment at a specific price and then that price was unknowingly updated to a higher price in the lease.,"I realize the lease is legally binding so there's not a lot I can do to weasel out of it since I didn't double check the price to be correct, but I'm curious if I can demand goodwill credit or something of the sort. Here is what happened: 

Found a listing on Craigslist, it was posted by an official management company (not just an independent landlord) and advertised being rent-controlled. In the body of the apartment description, it said the apartment was $1,750. When I applied, the same. When my application was accepted, a leasing agent emailed me and said this verbatim: 

""We are pleased to accept your application under the following terms:

1) Move in to be **April 1st, 2023.** 

2) Monthly Rent to be $**1750**

3) Security Deposit to be $**1750**

4) **April 2023** rent due in the amount of $**1750.** ""

The $1,750 amount was listed again in the email another couple times and we agreed that for me to move in I would provide $3,500 for 1st month's rent and deposit. When the lease came in, I frantically signed as I was desperate for a place, not thinking the price would be different in the lease. It was. They now have me signed as $1,795 a month. 

Again, I understand the position I'm in for not double checking the lease before signing. Don't need to hear about how I messed up as I am already aware, but seems like the original email should have been a binding agreement as well, right? Just curious if there's anything I can do. Obviously, would love to have my rate be $1,750 as originally agreed upon but in general because they made this mistake, can I demand any kind of goodwill credit or perks for the mistake they made? Any advice/context appreciated, thank you!"

Since then, I've been paying next to nothing for electricity, apparently because the meter was installed upside-down.

312,312,"Friends lawyer has gone off the deep end, what is the best way to move forward? LA, USA","Hey everyone, this takes place in Louisiana. So, my friend is beginning a custody case and her lawyer has filed for custody, child support, and restraining order which was apparently signed by a judge yesterday (according to her lawyer). Today, her lawyer has announced to her over the phone that he will not be her lawyer anymore, he doesn't want to be a lawyer at all, as well as some personal insults I won't repeat here. She has already contacted a second attorney but he was busy and said he will have to call her back (she spoke to him previously when deciding on representation so he's somewhat aware of her case).

Is there anything she needs to do today before the courts close to help the transition? What happens if her ex is served by the court before she can lock down another attorney? (I worry for her safety and now she doesn't have anyone to ask legal questions to for the time being). Can she file a complaint against him (attorney) and what would that look like? Can she litigate here? He's being really unprofessional and making an already difficult time even harder.

Also, I paid his retainer to represent her. He told her he would give it back (and his parents are both high up in the legal realm in her area so I have hope that will be worked out fairly easily as they probably don't want this incident made public). But, if I do have to fight for the retainer, what steps would we need to take?

Unrelated, I'm also pretty pissed off. I wanted her to choose a different lawyer because she knew this guy had some personal issues but she felt he had his life back on track and with his family connections, she thought he would be able to navigate this competently. He did exactly 2 things (took my money and filed the first stack of papers) and then took a swan dive into insanity. I'm livid. I want to fire off complaints on every legal review site I can find (but I won't for now). He also was recently assigned a juvenile murder case from the state (he volunteered that info to me when I was on the phone with him to pay the retainer) so he's just fucking with so many people's lives right now! Vent over. 

Thank you if you read this far and thank you for any insight you guys can offer. This is still playing out in real time so I'm sure more info will come up as things develope."
313,313,"Rent Control Violation, No Lawyer","Hi there,

I live in a city with rent control. Basically, my apartment cannot raise my rent more than 3% per year. I confirmed that they had violated the ordinance with the city and my community's Fair Housing Council (a non-profit the city provides contact information for in the event of a violation of the ordinance). The non-profit recommended I submit a letter of objection and offer to pay the 3% max increase per the rent control ordinance, and request a new lease agreement. My apartment never sent a new lease agreement and began charging me their 8.5% increase though I had not agreed to it and sent the letter of objection. Fair Housing Council tried to connect me to a lawyer that was supposed to be trying to pursue a class action since this is a large property owner that is actively involved in suing the city because they feel they cannot get a fair rate of return due to the rent control ordinance, but that's still up in the air. I found out recently that this lawyer might be fraudulent so I cannot pursue the lawsuit and have no legal representative. Currently, the city website, the city and their rent control staff responding to me, and this non-profit, confirm that my rent increase is unlawful. The city even shared a letter they have sent to my landlord warning them they are in repeated violation having done this to other tenants.

I'm afraid 1) my credit score will be effected and 2) I will owe money back if my large landlord wins their court case against the city. I have no idea what to do. Any thoughts on how I might proceed to protect myself?"

It's not a perfect match but it's pretty close and works more like a jiggler key. Regardless it worked. Not knowing how this key made it to my box I waited for the mailman and when he arrived I asked if any dealerships in the area recently did a key mailer sales event as I was able to trace an identical key online to a photo of an event in 2017 in another state. The mailman said yes then proceeded to pull.a several page flyer from a neighbors box and it was the matching key stuck to it. This flyer was humongous, and I really don't remember getting one but he said had been within the last week. It's a neighborhood box with many slots so maybe someone else's fell down into mine?

315,315,Can Land Owner Sue For Property Damage In Car Accident?,"About 3-4 weeks ago, my fiance was in a low-speed head on collision on a country back road. This is in the state of Kentucky and the road is a single lane, paved with no painted lines. 

She met an SUV over a hill-crest and neither driver could see each other until they met at the top. Luckily neither was going very fast at all and no one was hurt.

However, my fiance's little car was recoiled over a bank and hit a landowner's garage. Now I've not seen it myself, but I'm told the damage to his building was minimal and he was very nice about he whole ordeal at the time.

My fiance's car was totaled and only had liability. We ended up signing it over to the tow company because they wanted over $500 for a 6 mile town. The other driver had full coverage.

Kentucky, being a No-Fault State, deemed no one at fault on the police report. It literally says that the crest of the road was at fault and that neither driver could have anticipated the other.

Now the land owner of the garage is filing with our insurance over the damage to the garage. Our agent says they may deny the claim if the other driver's insurance isn't going to pay anything.

My question is this: if our insurance denies the land owners claim, can he then come after us legally for damages to his building? We just bought a home and basically drained our savings. We really can't afford the damages, let alone going to court over it. 

I apologize if this is a simple explanation. I'm pretty uneducated on how all this works. Also, I apologize if I've put the wrong flair. I honestly wasn't sure. Thank in advance!"

317,317,My old credit card company “doesn’t know” where my refund went,"Hi! Trying to figure out what to do… 
In January of this year, I (26F) returned an item at REI that was $160. However I have yet to receive this refund, and at this point, I don’t know if I’m ever going to get it. 

Here’s the backstory:
The original purchase (which was from April 2022) was processed online through PayPal, which was connected to a [now closed] Chase credit card. From what I can gather, REI charged PayPal, who charged my old credit card company (Chase). 

When I returned the item, I asked if I could have the refund go to a different card. REI said no because it had to go to the original card. So, I waited a few days to see if Chase would contact me about the refund that they received on my behalf. I heard nothing, so I reached out to them.

To make a long story short: after dozens of phone calls of me wasting hours of my life talking with Chase customer service, I was able to have (2) “internal investigations” done. The results of the first investigation was that “Chase doesn’t have your refund.” The results of the second investigation said “actually we lied, we did have you refund, but we sent it back to PayPal once we received it.”

So of course, I contacted PayPal. I then had two separate “money traces” done with them. They replied to both of the traces with the same thing: “we refunded Chase when the initial return happened back in January. We have not received anything back from them since. If we do receive anything, it’ll go right to your PayPal balance.”

I check PayPal every day. The money is never there. So at this point, my eye is on the sender (aka, Chase) not the receiver, as Chase was the last company to confirm that they had the refund in their possession. Out of desperation, I sent Chase a formal letter with a full explanation of the missing refund. However it’s now been two weeks and I have yet to hear a word from them.

I feel like this can’t be legal… what do I do?"

She sometimes lets us know when to cut our yard, like recently she had told me, she emailed on April 4, 2023 to cut my yard, there were storms and rain in the weekend and part of the week so I couldn't do it at all. She gave me till April 10. I could not do it till the weekend so she had to cut it. When I found the email it stated that she would be changing the price from 50$ to 75$. This is a service from her.

what I want to know is can I do something about the price from her? 
Is what she did with the price legal?

Our yard is incredibly small and I would have cut it the weekend prior if it wouldn't have rained.

319,319,Real Estate Law Question: Do we need to remove the deceased's name from home deed?," 

Trying to figure out if my mother needs a real estate lawyer!

My father died in 2018. Both my mother's and father's names were on the deed to the house, and their wills were set up with a simple transfer of ownership of the home if either of them was to die. However, the will never went through probate after he died because there were no other assets to transfer (my father had a gambling problem and committed suicide, so there were no funds or other assets to transfer, and no life insurance etc due to cause of death).

We are unsure if we need to have his name removed from the deed of the home? His name is also still on the home insurance. Searching the internet has received mixed answers, and my mother doesn't really have the funds to consult a lawyer if this is something that is not necessary. She is in NY.

321,321,Claiming unclaimed property for deceased person?,"I’m asked these questions for my mother-in-law. I discovered recently that each state has a page where you can claim your unclaimed monetary property. Out of curiosity I looked up close family to see if they had any to let them know. I was looking up my boyfriends last name and saw his moms name. When I told him about it he said that the listing was actually his great grandma (his moms maiden name was the exact same as her grandmas name). There were two items listed, both appear to be mutual funds over $100 (unsure how much exactly). My boyfriends great grandma died in the early 2000s so these have been sitting around for a minimum of 20 years unclaimed. My boyfriends mom was willed money directly from her grandma and his moms father/the great-grandmas son has also passed away and left everything to mom. Can she claim this money as a testate heir or would it be intestate? How involved would the process be to claim the money? Is there a legal process involved? Does it become more involved if the monetary amount were to be significant?"

324,324,Unlawful eviction? (Texas),"I have a question concerning a family member going through an ugly breakup. We'll call the persons involved 'A’ and ‘B’. I'll spare the details but basically a small hole was put in the wall about a year ago and a crack in a door. This is a small, very old mobile home. I say this because the damage in question can be repaired with a drywall patch and a $40 door. Fast forward to the the final straw and ultimately the end of the relationship. ‘A’ called the landlord, told them about the damage to which they told person ‘B’ they have until the end of the month to move. ‘B’ decided to grab what they could and left the same day. Landlord is threatening to also sue ‘B’ and not hold any liability to ‘A’ while also allowing them to continue to stay in the residence from here out. Mind you, landlord nor myself know anything about who/what/where/when/why as far as the damage goes-none of my business and I don’t care. What I’m wondering, since both parties entered into this together (verbal, no written lease), can he evict only one party without any written notice, or allowing them to fix the damage? I’m not sure if this matters, but ‘B’ paid all the rent and utilities and everything was also in their name. Is this a legal eviction and is ‘B’ on the hook for any damages since they will not be getting their deposit and ‘A’ will continue to live in the residence alone?"

I am having a baby and have been at the OBGYN where I currently go for 3 years.  This year, because we knew about the significant medical costs, I was put on my husband's insurance which is much better than mine and has lower deductible/out of pocket.  (We live in the USA)

I called the OBGYN and they said that they cannot legally use my husband's insurance since I still have one through my employer and that is the primary one by law.  I have never heard of such a thing and it is literally the difference of thousands of dollars between both deductibles, both out of pocket costs, etc. 

What is the law around this? Can I just lie and say I don't have mine anymore? They said they would just bill to my primary anyways and only if it came back negative would they bill to my husbands.  Are there any ways around this?

I'm so stressed just going through all of these procedures I don't know what to do, and this is really stressing me out.

I offered him to buy his stake and he said no. I offered him the option to buy me out and he said no. I suggested him to sell the house and he said no. He wants to keep my hands tied and I was forced to buy another property to move with my kids and leave our home alone. 

I can’t pay for both properties and he wants me to keep paying the mortgage for the first property, which I believe legally I have to. So I had an idea that I’m not sure if it’s legal. 

Since on the first floor there are two rooms that he is using as his bedroom and as his office/storage. On the second floor there are two rooms that were my kids’ and are empty now. The living room, kitchen, bathroom are common areas. Can I rent the two rooms on the second floor as my half of the house?

330,330,Question about reporting on job application (IL),"I was arrested for a DUI several years ago. Got court supervision, successfully completed the process and was discharged. I'm currently filling out an application that has the following language in the criminal record section: 

Convictions include all felony or misdemeanor convictions, whether by pleas of guilty, nolo contendere or no contest or after bench or jury trial. Convictions that result in sentences of probation, conditional discharge or imprisonment must be reported. Convictions of driving while intoxicated or under the influence (DUI), and driving on a revoked or suspended license must be reported. But, convictions that resulted in sentences of supervision in Illinois or traffic offences, other than DUI, or driving on a revoked or suspended license, should not be reported (i.e. speeding tickets, running a red light or stop sign, driving without insurance, etc.). Finally, you are not obligated to disclose sealed or expunged records of conviction or arrest.

The way I'm reading it is that as I received court supervision, I should not report it. Does this seem accurate?"
331,331,Solar Never Fully installed. AZ,"This a long story but will make it short and sweet. Long story short. I hired a broker to do a solar install. We secured funding (Loan) for the solar and once that's complete we then get the specifics of the solar install down. I was promised and I'm sure its  was written somewhere I did not have to start making payments on the solar loan til the solar is actually turned on and Functioning (Common practice).

&#x200B;

Well that's not at all what happened. The issue started shortly after signing the papers. I had spotty communication with the broker (We have used him before and so have friends and family). After getting the electrician out to upgrade my main panel I no longer had communications with the broker and could not get a hold of him. I was in contact with someone from another company that managed the install from there. The problem really starts getting bad when the solar is first delayed to be installed. Panels where suppose to be installed and functioning by Sept 10th ish but delays on getting the panels got pushed to October. This is where the headache really starts. The panels where installed but not turned on. Power company inspection failed there install about 6 times over the course next few months. Take note I felt like I was forced to start paying the loan that december (2021). So I was not able to turn on the solar I had been paying for until June of 2022. When The power company inspector had enough of problems (His words) and finally was down to a super simple fix (wires were flipped) and tested and gave it the good to go. From there I have been in contact with the SAME guy  at the company (Who by the way after the green light stop responding all of sudden) saying they would reimburse me for the money I had to pay during this ordeal. That never came obviously. I would just ask for that money back and some due to the power difference it would have made but this past saturday (4/8/2023) things took a weird turn. We had a power outage which is normal for this area but issue came during the day (Most ours happen at night and while we are sleeping through it) so I went to look at the battery backup I have a little more closely. Come to find out its not backing up any circuits it just charges from the solar and thats it. The conduit is ran too ""look"" like its connect but at the top of the battery back up panel its not (If your under 6""4ish you can't see over the panel to realize this).

&#x200B;

Sorry if I lost anyone on the mess of events. So the question is what can I do about this? Can I sue for the ""possible"" difference in bill and back pay what I shouldn't have had to pay? I do have text messages from all this along with the promise made about back pay. Thank you in Advance. 

&#x200B;

Note: I ended up going out of my way and just installing the ""Backed up"" Circuits myself"".

Another note: I'm now looking into this because the battery issue mentioned above just put the icy on the cake to want pursue this as I was just going to put it in my rear view before."

335,335,NY - Unfair dismissal due to coffee,"I started working for a mid-sized (50ish employees) media/tech agency in NYC this January as a salaried employee, and it's my first job out of school. I generally don't interact with clients, but my boss does.

This week the coffee machine in the office broke, and on Wednesday morning my boss asked me to do a coffee run before a client meeting for some coffee, including 1 latte with oatmilk, and he gave me $100 for the trouble (they cost about $50), and he instructed me to put the coffee into our branded mugs before bringing them to the meeting. About half an hour later there was an accident and we were evacuated from office, being told to take the rest of the day off. I worked from home yesterday. Today, Friday, I have received an email to my personal email address from my boss' boss that I am being dismissed with 2 weeks severance, with a prepaid label to ship my work laptop back. My work email and slack has already been disabled, and my boss hasn't answered my calls and messages.

According to a coworker I am friendly with, a person in that meeting had a pretty bad accident, and they are hiring a cleaning crew to deep clean the whole office. I realized I messed up because when I checked the receipt and it showed that I had ordered a soymilk latte instead of oatmilk, and I guess this person is allergic to soy. I didn't even learn of this detail until today, and only through the grapevine, and obviously I didn't do this intentionally. I am truly sorry that this happened, and I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the person who I harmed.

But to dismiss me for such a small honest mistake seems very unfair, especially because I just signed a lease and really need the money and work is hard to come by.

What can I do?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just heard from my coworker that my boss might have also been dismissed which is why he hasn't responded to me (I brought the coffees to him in our company mugs, he brought them into the meeting and distributed them). I haven't admitted my mistake to anyone yet, as I am not sure whether the person who had the accident was the one who had the latte (I don't know who it was, but it's likely someone on the client side, because otherwise my coworker would have told me). I will be contacting an employment lawyer Monday, just want to know my options before that."
336,336,Unfairly terminated as a patient from dermatology clinic due to me posting “bad review”," I was recommended electrodessication for my facial moles. The aesthetician did the procedure and the area turned black and unsightly. it was a quick less than 5 min procedure. I was told the moles will form a scab and fall off naturally after a few days. but the moles did not fall off. They look the same in pictures like before the procedure but worse.I checked online and electrodessication done elsewhere had the patient’s moles flattened right then and there. But mine was still raised & pigmented a few days after the scabs fell off. It looks like a messy at home apple cider vinegar treatment. If I paid $100 to have something removed, it should be removed or atleast attempted to fix the aftermath of it on my FACE.

After the 2nd session one of the moles is still raised but bigger than original. I was told   The aesthetician  went deeper the 2nd session but why would you do that without consulting with me first? Now it just look like some acne scar. Why did a small mole needs multiple sessions and why it left a red bigger raised lesion after the 2nd session? At the 3rd appointment, they decided to not do anything and let it “heal” longer so I set up a 4th apt after 4 months. The after picture looks messy like it wasn’t done by a professional in a derm office. It’s upsetting.

—
 Then the manager called me stating she will cancel my 4th apt bc of the bad reviews I wrote. She made it seem like I was writing multiple bad reviews when I wrote 1 about my experience. Am I not allowed to share my experience on google?  I asked her why they can’t fix the problem that they created and her justification was that she doesn’t recommend further treatment due to my SKIN COLOR. Why did they go ahead with the procedure in the 1st place then?When I ask her why it was undertreated and still left a raised scar and discoloration, she had no answer. She said they will terminate me as a patient with no solution to the problem. Her reasoning was that this is not the “patient provider” relationship she wants bc of the “negative review” I wrote and she will discharge me as a patient and refund my $. That is no valid justification to terminate a patient. Shame on them for making me go to the clinic 3 times and wasting my time and moles. I had to deal with 2 wounds on my face for 3 months. Is that what they  do when they mess up, call and terminate the patient from further coming to the clinic Based on FREE SPEECH?"
337,337,Overtime Question,"Location: North Carolina / hourly wage 



I'm a bit confused about the overtime pay regulations here in NC. Every 2 weeks I receive a new project which typically starts on a Wednesday and lasts until the following Tuesday. Sometimes I'll work 65+ hours to complete the project in 6 days or less. Am i entitled to overtime after 40 hours ?

338,338,Notice period for end of employment,"I work in Missouri and I'm an at will employee. A few days ago, I contacted HR and told them that I had found a new job and would be leaving in two month. When the HR manager had gone over my contract when I was hired, I remember her saying that I had to give two months notice when leaving. The HR manager replied and confirmed my leaving date would be in two months. I let my new employer know my start date, so they could schedule training.

Today, the HR manager emailed me to say that she had reviewed my contract and it says that I have to give three months notice. What are my options here? Can they legally enforce the 3 months?"

340,340,NEED HELP - How do I remove my phone number from a real estate property or understand my rights with the National Do Not Call list,"I'm at the end of my rope here so hoping someone can help here. 

For the past year at least, I have gotten about 50+ phone calls and text messages asking if I'm interested in selling a property in Florida. It's always the same property and they're also referring to me as ""Fannie"". The thing is....my name is not Fannie and I do not, nor have I ever owned a property in Florida.... 

I've had this number since roughly 2004, so I'm not sure if it would be that the person who had the number previously is the actually owner of this property since the calls/texts only started a year ago. 

At this point, I block every call that comes in but every time I block it a new one calls. I've googled the property and it's not for sale and my phone number isn't listed anywhere that I can see in association with this number. I've asked the people who call how they got my number and they get weird and just say that it's ""public record"" and usually hang up. 

Is there a way to remove my phone number from being tied to this property? I've been registered on the National Do Not Call list since 2008 (double checked this recently). I'm not sure if these types of calls are covered under that but I'm losing it at this point and saw somewhere that you can sue unwanted/telemarketing calls if you're on that list in small claims court and seriously considering it if it's an option. 

Please help!"
341,341,Car illegally crushed,"Hampton Roads, VA

Posting here in hopes someone might be able to provide some help or guidance. I've already called several lawyers and no one seems to deal with my particular scenario. My car insurance also denied my claim. So now I'm pretty much screwed.

The jist of what happened - my car was disabled in a business parking lot and ended up getting towed. Not entirely unexpected. The issue however is that within 2-3 days of my car being towed, they transferred it to a salvage yard and had it crushed. No contact or notice was sent. I only found out when I went to have my vehicle towed myself and found it missing. The business was kind enough to check the cameras for me to get an idea of when it was towed. When I called the tow company, the owner was a straight up prick and said, ""that cars gone buddy, it doesn't exist anymore"". I was able to track down the salvage yard that crushed it and they confirmed they crushed the car a little over a week ago. So from towing, to transfer to the salvage yard, to crushing was less than a week in total. The tow company only held the car for 2-3 days.

This was a fully registered, insured vehicle with the taxes current. Everything worked with the exception of the transmission cable snapping. Which left me unable to put it in gear and why it was stuck in a parking lot to begin with. I've already called and spoken with several lawyers. A few of which have said that the tow company definitely violated state law. That they're required to hold it for at least 30 days and send notice to the registered owner (me). Which the tow company clearly didn't do. But none of them handle this kind of scenario. Based on KBB the car was still worth $4600-$6000.

At this point I'm pretty lost and unsure of what to do. I filed a complaint with the VA attorney general's consumer protection but I have little faith that'll do anything."
342,342,Contractor giving me the run around and keeps delaying work,"First let me say that I am *way* too trusting and I know now that I didn't do any of my due diligence before signing a contract with this guy.

I contracted with a guy to redo the master bathroom in a home I just moved into. Everything was being gutted and replaced except the standup shower. New tile, tub, vanity, and lighting. This was back in mid-February. I paid a $5k downpayment on a $9k contract. Original estimate was 2-3 weeks. After 2-3 weeks, the only work that had been done was demoing.

I had told him I wanted hexagon tile, and he said he was having a hard time sourcing what I wanted. I told him to just order what I wanted from Wayfair and get it shipped. He said the contracted price was for tile that was $2/sq ft (not documented on the contract). The tile I wanted was $7/sq ft, and he wanted me to pay an additional $1k for the cost difference and extra labor for laying smaller tile. This was in mid-March. Like I said up top, I'm too trusting and didn't question this, so I paid the additional $1k.

Over the course of the past month, he has kept making it sound like the tile would be here soon, but then he'd always have a reason for why it wasn't here yet. He said he messed up and ordered the wrong tile, had to return it and place a new order. He showed up earlier this week with one box of tile and laid it, saying the rest would be here in a few days. My suspicion radar FINALLY was going off by this point and I kept pressing him to send me a tracking number for the new order. He hadn't given me any info on this order until today.

He finally sends me a few hours ago not a tracking number, but an order number. I decided to call Warfair and hope they would give me some details on this order. Thankfully once I explained who I was and why I was calling, I was able to give enough identifiable details about the contractor that they would talk to me about the order despite it not being an order I placed. Turns out the order for that order number was placed 2 hours prior to me calling them. It *is* the correct tile, and it all seems to be the correct quantity, but will take 1-2 weeks to be delivered.

I ask them about the prior ""wrong"" order, and they have no record of it. They see the 1 box purchase that he ordered previously that he laid earlier this week, then today's order, and that's it. I called my contractor to confront him about all of this. He kept saying he never lied, that he actually placed the wrong order that got delivered, and that the delay on ordering the new shipment was because of some issue with his account being put on hold that he didn't know about. So I ask for the email confirmations of the ""wrong"" order, and he mysteriously can't find them...said he must had accidentally deleted it (yet he would had gotten multiple emails...order placed, order shipped, order delivered).

It's one excuse after the other, and he finally exceeded even my gullibility in believing him. A 2-3 week job has now exceeded 2 months, and all I have is a demoed bathroom with new lights, 1 box of tile laid, and a corner shelf where the tub will go.

I don't know where to go from here. I just want this project finished. Wayfair confirmed that at least the order is placed, and it is correct. Do I have any legal grounds for recouping any of the downpayment and finding a new contractor to finish? The additional $1k I'm discovering was also over-estimated based on him telling me it would be $200 for additional labor, plus the cost difference in tile which should actually be around $500. I'm >$6k invested, and small claims court in my state is for $6k and less. Or, have I willy nilly agreed to too much and I'm on the hook now? All the lies he has told him he has no paper trail for and would not be able to prove."
343,343,"Probate, federal taxes (Pennsylvania)","Hello, 

I have posted here before about this issue, the post has been locked since, I have more questions so I’m posting again. 


My MIL parents passed last year. They left a house to her, a retirement account to be divided between the siblings and an old car. There are some other things but they are more of sentimental value, not monetary. 
I thought that probate had been initiated before since it has been months since the parents passed, but it seems that probate only started a few weeks ago. 

The money from the retirement account has been split and given to each sibling already, leaving only the house and car to be passed from the estate to my MIL. The parents(estate) owe federal taxes. The issue is, my MIL doesn’t have money to pay the taxes, she also has her own taxes to pay, besides the inheritance tax on the house. I’m not sure about the car situation, but it’s a very old car, probably worth $2k or less honestly.

We are working on getting the house ready to be sold, but there are other family members currently living there. So MiL will have to write a notice for them to leave so the house can be sold.

My main question in all this is, shouldn’t the lawyer have waited until probate goes through the court to split the money from the retirement account? Because that money could be used now to pay the federal taxes. What happens if the house doesn’t sell quick enough to pay for the federal and inheritance taxes? 
Also, my MIL mentioned that there was some kind of deal between her parents and the lawyer for him to be retained to do this probate process. Is this a thing that lawyers do? Or he said that so my MiL would hire him $ ?"

345,345,[Florida] I was scammed by someone in public. Do I have any form of recourse?,"TL;DR: I bought a fake sound system from a man at a gas station but I have his Name, FB profile, and License Plate #. Cops say there's nothing I can do but is that true?

About 2 weeks ago I was filling up at a gas station when a man filling up next to me leaned over and asked if I wanted to buy a soundbar out of his trunk. Stupid I know but he was driving a nice car and was very convincing. Needless to say, a lot of the red flags that I missed at the time are now blatantly apparent. He claimed that it was a great system and they even ""sell it at Best Buy"". He pulled out a little catalogue and showed a product that looked similar to it what he had in his trunk but he didn't let me look at it for too long. If he had, I might have noticed that Best Buy sells Sonos sound systems and what he was selling was a ""Sono2"". Googling it shows that it's a common scam pulled all over. The packaging looks super legitimate and inside is something that looks like a soundbar and comes with some papers that look like they might be instructions but upon closer look, are completely useless. The system itself has useless ports and no cordage that could possibly connect to it, only a useless old micro-usb.

He tried to sell it for around $500 but I talked him down to $150 (another red flag I realize). He tried to get me to pay in cash but I refused so he conceded and agreed to pay with Cash App. While he had his profile open, I took a picture of his account name and tag. As he was driving away, I felt a pit in my stomach that maybe I was being grifted so I got out my phone and managed to take a picture of his license plate too. 

That night, I tried to set it up and big shocker... it was a piece of junk. There was no possible way it could connect to my TV. I reached out to the cops and they said since it was done in public, wasn't prearranged, and was for only $150, there was nothing they could do. I did some digging though and was able to find his facebook page with multiple pictures of him as well as the company he works for (it's some kind of very suspicious looking health insurance company). I also looked at his license plate number online and although I can't do a full report, I confirmed that it matched the vehicle. I attempted to reach out to him on Facebook privately to see if he would give me a refund and as expected, he blocked me.

I've reported him on Cash App and requested a refund but they've since rejected it. He's also changed his last name to STFO which I can only speculate on what that means. I'm in talks with customer support right now but I'd be surprised if that led to anything of value. 

Is there anything I can do legally? I know I could take him to small claims and with that comes fees that would most likely cost more than I could possibly get back but I'm not entirely opposed to the idea just on principal. Any advice would be much appreciated."

348,348,CPS ADVICE??,"Hello, 
So long story short. My sister was married to this man who was an alcoholic & fought with her constantly, (never abused the kids but constantly abused her) she had taken her two kids (14 & 9) and went to my mother's house an hour away in a different state for 12 days to get away from him, school ended up calling CPS & the children ended up being taken away from my sister and placed with my father. CPS gave the case to a foster agency as I am sure they have a huge caseload. But that agency has completely left my sister out of the loop and has gone to extreme lengths to keep my sister from her kids. My sister has moved to a new house, filed for divorce from her husband and has had no contact with him at all, she has done hair follicle drug tests and passed them all. Today was court & the 14 year olds father was there who has been out of his life since he was 5 months old, requesting custody of him???? Has never even met this kid since he left him at 5 mo, or spoke to him Mind you, this father has been in and out of prison, once for being behind on child support for said child. 14 yo wants absolutely nothing to do with him & has cried to his mother to get his last named changed for years. The foster agency didn't say a single word to my sister at court today, and was completely rude to her but spoke all nice to the dead beat father, giving him paperwork, telling him all the steps he needed to take to get custody, etc. What do you know? Judge ordered him to take a hair follicle & we have another court date 3 months from now. We have no idea what to do to get these kids back with my sister as they are constantly calling us and her begging to come.back. I have called numerous attorneys and all are afraid to take cases against CPS. Also, this foster agency was just sued for 10m and lost due to fraud & not giving kids back so they can collect checks on them. Reviews of this place are filled with parents scammed by them. 
!! I understand there sounds like there is more to the story, but there really isn't much more my sister has been the absolute best mother,  but married the wrong guy and couldnt leave
 I also understand that there are alot of children that need to be taken out of homes, but my neice and nephew were not one ."

Every time she would say, “hopefully this week” “I’ll check with the accountant” something along those lines. Well February turned to march and now it’s April and she’s telling us she can’t give us our W-2s but she has to give us a 1099 instead. And this was her text message explaining why. Can someone please make sense of this situation for me bc it sounds so sus and weird. 
“I am doing the talk to text since I am driving home. Please forgive any grammatical errors it may substitute.
I can feel your palpable anger, and I am truly sorry. have no control over this at all. I would never do anything to compromise y'all or withhold anything that is yours. This has just gotten to be a much bigger situation than we expected and this is why. We knew there was information missing that was going to have to be recreated after the tornado. When the new accountant started digging into everything and had all of the information that we have. She realized that the old accountant who had it for 2021 never filed any taxes. What I mean by that is he never filed our state tax, local tax, and federal taxes quarterly. So according to the federal government, you didn't make any money last year. What that means for us now is probably going to look like this. we will more than likely as per the accountants recommendation, issue you all a 1099. That means you are an independent contractor and would be responsible if you truly were independent for your taxes. Well, we both know I took the taxes out of your check. So basically what's gonna happen is that we will end up having to refund you the taxes we took out of your check and you'll be basically getting your refund from us instead of the federal government.
You will still file but hopefully it will just be a wash -if you do have to pay it should equal to what we gave you back in taxes. Does that make sense?
I had no idea this happened. I gave them my statements like we always have and usually the accountant pulls whatever we owe in taxes out of our digital account and pays it. I've gotten no information that said otherwise, so I had no reason to be concerned. We have received maybe one statement from the federal government that said it was a late payment and we owed $100. I know this is confusing. It is for me as well and I'm sorry that happened. Like I said before, I would never have done anything intentional to hurt you girls.

Statue of limitations in AZ to bring charges on a misdemeanor is one year So how is this legal? I’ve consulted some lawyers who told me ethically I should just go to the arraignment and ask the judge to throw it out based on the statute of limitations. I feel like I’m just being harassed at this point. 

Should I just shell out money for a lawyer anyways? How should I approach the judge during my arraignment? Bring a copy of the statute of limitations law to present to the court?

356,356,Real Estate: Foreclosure Surplus Disbursement among Joint Tenants in Common,"If there is a surplus generated by a foreclosure sale, those funds get distributed to the former deeded homeowners. In the case of joint tenants on a deed, the surplus will be distributed to two parties.

For example, party A put up 100k, and party B put up 50k. Are those amounts given back to the respective parties and then the remaining funds are split 50/50?

First off, let me give you a run down on what happened....

My mom hired an agency which hired me as their employee to get paid as my mom's caregiver. Mom is extremely displeased with the Owners of the company and their unprofessionalism, so she terminates them as her agency. My boss repeated to me ""You can quit."" ""You can quit."" In which I replied, I'm not quitting. I go into work to pick up my paycheck today since my mom has terminated them as her agency and my boss tells me she needs me to sign some forms. When I asked her what they were, she said that they were separation papers and what was marked off on them had an checked box that said that I involuntarily quit. I told her I wasn't signing the papers. Then she hands me a form that shows $50 dollars deducted from my paycheck for a background check. I reiterated again that I didn't quit and then she then forces me to take a shift with a client, either 6 or 12 hour shift for the very next day. I told her she can't legally force me to take a client, in which she says that I'm refusing to take an assignment and then asked me to turn in my badge. 

What in the utter bullshit was this?! and where do I go from here? I feel discriminated upon due to my mom letting them go as her hired agency, but I feel like I was wrongfully terminated. 

**Any suggestions, advice, or direction would be appreciated. And if anything, someone to validate how incredibly fucked up this situation was. <3**"
361,361,Vet told me that my dogs leg was fine and now he can't walk without surgery,"Austin, TX. So when I first got my puppy Rot, he was a rescue and had a bit of a limp in his hind leg. We took him to the vet to get his first visit and check his health and what not. I brought up his limp(at the time it wasn't very noticable) and he said it was nothing to worry about. Now it's been a couple months since then and we went to a different vet and they took x-rays because it's gotten a little worse. The pup walked in fine, had x-rays, figured out he never even had a socket for one of his hind legs. We loaded him up into the truck very carefully and when on the way home he started acting very different; In a lot of pain and whining a bunch. We took him back and they said the maneuvering for the x-rays is probably what did it but that it could of happened at the next fall he takes. The fact that it could have happened soon, I believe. The fact it was overlooked when I specifically brought it up and asked about it with the first vet is what really ticks me. We called them and they said that that vet is no longer with them. Now were either looking at surgery which will be very expensive or the other option... I barely make rent right now which is one of the reasons I asked the first vet if the leg was something to be concerned about.  Is there anything I can do besides the options I presented considering the first vet visit?
Thank you in advance for any help!"
362,362,College not cleaning dorm bathrooms for weeks at a time.,"My college cleans the dorm bathrooms maybe once a month if that. I feel like there is a legal requirement to clean ""public"" restrooms at least once a day. The soap has been empty for at least three weeks in one bathroom (that I'm aware of) and whenever someone has stomach troubles, the mess ends up caked to everything because we don't have access to brushes or anything like that. During that time of the month, some girls leave blood all over the seat and the rest of us have been avoiding that bathroom because it's had a bloody seat for over a month now. It's like a damn biohazard. Is this something I need to report to the school? We've tried telling the RA about it but the housing manager won't do anything, according to her. What can I do?

Forgot to mention - I'm located in Idaho."

In these tweets, he both mentions the college and his place of employment. My job is aware that he was arrested and is doing nothing about the matter and I am terrified. He actually showed up to work a few hours after being released! I understand that it's innocent until proven guilty in a court of law but it will take 5 seconds of scrolling down his Twitter to see the evidence. I genuinely just don't know what to do as I don't really know my rights as a worker in regards to another employee planning to be a mass murderer?

I ended up finding a different job so this is all I did with the company, I never actually began working.

367,367,Terminating a commercial internet & phone services contract w/ cause,"TLDR: New provider didn’t grant first month of service free as stated in proposal. Is this a material breach of contract?

I switched providers for my businesses wifi and phone services at the beginning of the year. Company prides themselves on excellent customer service as it’s very local. In the proposal the agreement first month fees and install fees were supposed to be waived. Install fees were waived however first month of services were not waived. 

I have contacted my business rep by phone 3 times. First instance no reply. Second time was told he’d get on it. Third time I called he seemed apologetic and said he’d take care of it. That was a week ago and still nothing has been done.

The contract is for 3 years/36 months. It does have a clause in it about termination with cause for a material breach of contract. It denotes that I would have submit a written notice and they have 30 days to cure the material breach. My question is: Is not granting me the first month of free services a material breach of contract?"
368,368,Non-refundable lessons with unavailable teacher,"I paid for private lessons with a teacher a year ago, on the agreement that it would be a 12 week semester with weekly lessons, over Zoom, as I am in the UK while they live and work in Massachusetts. 

These lessons were non-refundable, and I paid upfront over Paypal directly to him for all 12 lessons to benefit from a discount. 

It's now been a year, and despite reaching out frequently, only 2 lessons took place and it has been extremely hard to communicate with the teacher, who has been ignoring my emails for weeks at times (he is an artist and has been on tour etc., which I only learned over social media ! ). 

Recently, the only way to get a hold of him was to mention looking into alternatives to get a refund (he suddenly answered extremely fast). He offered to work with me to find a time that would work for both of us, including moving the hours of his other students to ensure that the lessons will take place in the next few weeks, but that the lessons are non refundable.

At this stage and after a year of trying to have a regular schedule for the lessons, I've lost patience and I just would like to get my money back and not continue with a teacher who barely answers me.
Given that he has not been providing the service I paid for over the last year and ghosted me for weeks each time, is there any laws that could force him to refund me ? I would only want the refund for the 10 lessons that he did not provide (which would still be more than $1500). 

As I said, I do not live in the US, which might make it a little more complicated.

369,369,Wrongful termination/ Go to HR/ or move on?,"New York State resident. Country club kitchen employee, with the club 8 years, zero write ups, verbal warnings, none of that. 
Got a new head chef running the kitchen since November ‘22.

This new hire starts in the kitchen last Friday, work a portion of the line and banquets. I gotta train him to be in pantry during the day time. he’s never seen a kitchen before. It’s whatever. Unprompted, within an half hour, he tells me how he was offered $2 more than me to start. Taking that as the insult that it was, I spent my weekend looking for a second job and came across a listing for new hires at my current job, confirming that he wasn’t just making shit up. I knew for a fact this affected many other people in the kitchen who have been there for years as well, so I informed them in order to improve our pay this Wednesday of this as well. Yesterday I went to the chef and told him how I thought it was insulting and he told me five times it was a taboo topic. After that, it was clear to me he wasn’t going to take the topic seriously at all I asked him if that were the case could I at least not be expected to train a newbie that’s being paid more than me. I was sent home for the evening to discuss it today. In the mean time, last night during the rest of the shift, one of those coworkers also went to the chef to discuss the same topic. This morning I received a call from the chef where I was told I was being let go because the club is moving in a different direction.

370,370,Restraining order was not granted,"My friend (actually not me I’m literally asking because I care about this person) recently filed divorce and restraining order against husband. Helped her testify against him at the restraining order hearing, but the judge did not grant the permanent restraining order. 

We shared info about his alcoholism, his temper- destruction of property when angry, and scared minor child walking in on attempted suicide with gun twice. We shared that info amongst other details like drunken rants about crazy political conspiracy beliefs, copious amounts of artillery, and how he admitted to infidelity against her. Basically for over a decade, she’s been emotionally abused- gaslighted, to outsiders they’d see perfect marriage and appearance of financial stability but behind closed doors/behind the scenes he’s been an asshole to her… Over the year there have been red flags friends like us would witness: some she informed us about, some we picked up on ourselves. The guy has been cool to us overall so nobody has wanted to get in the middle, but after what happened recently that’s a different story. 

Lately things got out of hand where he’s punching walls and destroying physical property when they have disagreements. I’ve seen him get in her face many times, been scared what he would do to her. She has confided in me over the years many times how scared she was but was not sure what to do. She was trying to come up with plan to leave, but secretly as she didn’t want to rock the boat… Since their latest blow up, she finally got that courage to file for divorce and he has been making her life hell since (manipulation, lying, talking badly about her to others/making up stories trying to get them to think she’s crazy so he can take their kid). He demonstrates narcissistic behavior and is a smooth talker that has said things over the years to make her sound like just another crazy b**ch. 

The cherry on top of all this being that he’s taken all their money out of the bank, not paid the mortgage and other bills for months, and not paid money he owes other people for various things he’s sold (cars, claiming to pay friends for handiwork around the house and not ever doing so). I guess he’s always trying to stay in control. 

Anyway, the husband had threatened suicide twice and got aggressive, cops were called as prior event leading up to temporary restraining order and this court date. 

We let judge know we still care about this guy just that we believe he needs help. We also mentioned being scared of him retaliating because of this trial.

Everyone with a conscience has been scared of this man because of threats he’s made and physical ability to follow through on them (diagnosed bipolar on meds, who because likes hunting, has a room filled with weapons. Legal weapons but still weapons nonetheless).

Despite this, the judge would not grant the order (said much of the info was “irrelevant”).

What the ****?!

Is there anything she can do to appeal this? Her husband will want to come home soon and she is genuinely scared for her safety (retaliation). She is also afraid he will try to take their child."
371,371,Dental filler fell out during root planning,"I went to a dentist for root planning in 2020, and during the process, a former filler fell out. It was likely because they took it as my natural tooth and put abrasion on it.

They followed up with a new filler but had to clean up the hole beforehand. Therefore, the hole was made even deeper. I’m now under the danger of reaching the nerve if the hole is enlarged for even the least bit.

I was talking about this past due bill with them recently and claimed that the cost for the new filler should not be on me, but the dentist has not replied after more than a week.

As soon as she handed him the summons he could see the obvious mistake and tried to advise her, but she just said he was wrong, you have been served and left. 

I called the court to explain the mistake, then also sent an email to the clerk of the court explaining the mistake, the clerk responded saying she would forward the information to the people that needed to be informed and I thought the matter was resolved. 

A week later I got mail from the court that had been sent a few days after I emailed the clerk of the court. I emailed her back but no response, it's been nearly a week with no response, I sent 1 follow up email after 3 days but that also received no response. 

The summons is only a week away, it's in Niagara Falls NY which is over 2000 miles away. It's a child support issue between people I have never met but the paperwork is covered with threats of a bench warrant for non compliance. 

My huge concern is that at some point due to this mistake by the court, police are going to show up in the middle of the day while I am working and interrupt that which could get me in serious trouble with my employer and I really want to avoid that. 

I feel like at this point talking to a lawyer might be my best bet, but even a lot of the ""affordable"" lawyer web pages I have looked have snippets on them that are like (Get started for as little as $500) which seems like a lot of money to me.

My ex has convinced them to help her return the children and they agreed but stated it'd be the last time they ever bring her anywhere.

381,381,Insurance carrier declined my claim last year. Contacted me this year stating they made a mistake.,"I was involved in an automobile accident in the beginning of 2022 and the accident was determined to be my fault. My car was totaled and sent to a storage facility while I waited for my insurance company to handle my claim. The insurance carrier declined my claim because they stated that my policy was liability only and since I was deemed to be at fault I would be responsible for the damage to my vehicle. My car was auctioned off by the storage facility eventually and I defaulted on my loan. My credit score cratered because I was unable to make my loan payments and I had to borrow my wife's car or catch a ride to get around places. I was also turned down by an employer due to a failed background check and the reason they cited was the auto loan which was not in good standing. Life was sort of difficult for a few months, but I caught back up and everything is fine now.

&#x200B;

In March of this year I dug through some insurance paperwork and found my policy which showed that I had full coverage insurance. I contacted the insurance carrier and they admitted that it was an internal mistake and apologized profusely and promised to take care of things. I'm dealing with them on replacement value of my vehicle and they are using the market value of the car based on present values and not last years. Last year the used car market was hot and prices were much greater. They're also deducting $5k because they were unable to recover the salvaged vehicle. It was entirely their fault to begin with. If they'd handled the claim correctly they would have had the salvaged vehicle.

&#x200B;

Do I have any recourse for punitive damages? They insurance company acted in bad faith in declining my claim. I'm not getting anywhere with the adjuster's as they're just pointing the finger at each other. Should I have an attorney involved? Any advice is much appreciated."
382,382,"Landscape company used wrong color blocks for large retaining walls, refuses to fix it.","We hired a company to do a large renovation of our back and front yard (spending a little over $100k). Part of the project was replacing 3 retaining walls with stone block, costing us $16k. The color choice for the blocks was given to them via text message. 

The day they started installing the new blocks, we noticed that they were the wrong color. And they're not just off by a little bit, it's a completely different aesthetic. We immediately sent a text to the owner of the company and he drove over to take a look. A conversation was had in person where he said that the one we wanted would take 3 weeks to come in, and he thought this one would match our house better (which is also natural stone). We pushed back but he convinced us to wait and see what it looks like once the walls start going up. 

After one of the walls was partially complete, we again expressed our disappointment with the stone (in person convo, not written). He said he could bring in another color to mix in with the current stone, to help balance it out. We were reluctant but he asked us to give it a chance, so we did. The walls were finished within another day and we really don't like the final product. The quality of the install is great, but the block clashes with the stone on our house. We said this to him and he didn't see it. We hired a professional home color consultant who immediately told us the retaining walls clash with the stone on the house. She recommended either replacing the walls or painting the natural stone on our house (which the HOA will not approve). 

The owner of the landscaping company is now saying that we never expressed being unhappy with the stone until now. Even after showing him the text messages we sent him, he still says the in person conversations never happened. He's refusing to do anything about the blocks unless we pay full price for labor and materials. We'd be willing to help pay for some of it but he's doubling down on it not being his fault. 

We don't know how to move forward with this. We would prefer to find a resolution we can all be happy with, we aren't wanting to screw this guy over. But we also think that if we're spending this much money, we should get the product we ordered. 

How should we approach this?"
383,383,What are my rights as a property owner that has a town easement,"A few years ago I purchased my first home here in Connecticut. The property has an access road that runs through it which I found out is an easement to my local town's emergency services. This access road runs into the woods behind my property and circumnavigates the pond to access the marina on the other side roughly a little over a quarter mile away. Out of the 5 years I have owned the property not once have I seen the town use the access road nor have I seen them maintain the path through the woods which considerable overgrown right now.  Additionally the marina has installed a large heavy duty metal fence on the other end of the path around 2 years ago.

What I would like to do is to dig out the access road and level out my back yard in order to expand its usable square footage as the far edge of the access road is 10ft off the property line with the road being 8ft wide and runs for 130ft through the property. This is a lot of land that the access road takes up.

388,388,I was in an accident and they are threatening getting a personal injury attorney. What should I expect next?,"Last month I rear ended a mini van. It was very minor, even the cop stated he couldn’t do an accident report because there wasn’t enough damage. The tricky part is I was driving without insurance (I know it’s dumb, I was trying to get to work to do overtime so I could afford it, less than 6 months out of a dv relationship trying to rebuild but I recognize that does not excuse or remove any responsibility from me) I approached the cop to let him know that my insurance lapsed and dealt with the dmv and impound fees. I now have insurance so I don’t need to be reminded how dumb it is to not have it - which brings me to the point. 

The lady who was driving the mini van and her husband are now saying they need several thousand dollars. Half of which is for medical bills but they did not see any general physicians or go to an emergency room, the only medical plan is from a chiropractor who they told me themselves is a friend who is giving them a deal. And I don’t think there is much I can do about that so I have been trying to find ways to get the money, even looking into loans but I am still trying to rebuild my credit so I haven’t had luck. Now I’m not getting it fast enough and they are threatening to sue, which I understand but I also do not know what to expect or what to do if it does happen and I am unable to afford representation.

Do I even need representation or can I just not contest and let them garnish my check? I’m not trying to avoid responsibility, just trying to keep this fair and also avoid this being a lengthy thing everyone. I also am having a hard time thinking through things clearly because I panic and think that there is no way this doesn’t just go the worst way possible and ruin my life right when I’m trying to start it.

390,390,My mother is being barred from seeing her mother (my grandmother) by her sisters. Is there anything she can do to see her?,"Hi Reddit,

I just got off the phone with my crying mother (64) because she was just told by her mom (87) that she “doesn’t want her to come/I don’t want to see you” when they’ve been visiting yearly this time of the year because it’s my grandmothers birthday.

For preface, my grandfather died 5 years ago due to Alzheimer’s, and my two sisters, Karen and Jenny, have been taking care of my grandmother, Amy, ever since. 

She was never taken to an elderly home, Karen and Jenny wanted to take care of Amy themselves. Jenny bought a house right next to Amy so she can be there, and Karen visits regularly. It’s a gated community. And Jane was told that they won’t open the gate for her. 

Jane and Amy have always had a good relationship and never had a falling out of any kind. This news came out today, the day before my parents are supposed to leave for the 28 hour drive. 

As additional information, Jane and her sisters have never gotten along well. There was always  a lot of internal strife among siblings, and ever since their father died, it’s been going downhill. 

Is there any recourse my mom has to see her own mother? It’s obviously manipulation from my two aunts that convinced my grandmother that she doesn’t want to see her own daughter. Because there has never been any friction or cause for such action.  

My own thoughts are to challenge my aunts ability to take care of her and to try and get her into a home for the elderly. I also think my mom should push my grandmother asking for a reason “why” she doesn’t want to see her.

391,391,EBT closure help please TAX PAPERS,"Please help, I have a one year old and a 4 month old, my case worker closed my case because my rent exceeds my income, embarrassingly I was pregnant and sick and struggling with depression, never worked as much as I should have but my in laws helped pay my rent. What do I do? How do I explain this? Obviously them helping isn’t on my taxes and I have no proof

392,392,Landlord hasn’t *properly* fixed my AC/Furnace/HVAC for over 5 months,"For the past 5 months, i have been having basically a non-functioning AC/furnace system in my apartment (e.g., room temp is reading as 80 degrees, i change to cooling mode, target temp of 68 degrees and the fan to “on” rather than auto, and nothing happens). I have requested fairly frequently for the past 5 months to have this fixed, and maintenance will come in, look in the utility closet, do something (not sure what in particular), and the system will kick back on, but then almost like clockwork, about 3 or 4 days later, the AC/furnace stop working and it goes back to the same state with the same issue. And so then i open another maintenance request just for the cycle to repeat all over again. I believe there’s some kind of electrical issue or a deeper issue with the HVAC system as i’ve tried replacing the stock thermostat with one of my own with no luck. Which is about all i can do as my utility closet is locked so i can’t tinker with any of that myself.

It has become fairly miserable - outside temps where i am have been getting to mid 70s, and inside my apartment the temp is averaging around 80 degrees. So my patience has just about been exhausted. I can only imagine how miserable it’ll be once the temps raise to 90 or above. 

My lease agreement has a clause stating:

RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. We’ll act with customary diligence to:
…
(2) maintain fixtures, furniture, hot water, heating, and A/C equipment;
…
(4) make all reasonable repairs, subject to your obligation to pay for damages for which you are liable as required by ORC 1923. 
…


Would this be in violation of the agreement? I believe it would but I worry about the fact that it *temporarily* returning to working (even if it remains not working about 80-90% of the time) weakens my case. 

Assuming the previous point doesn’t weaken my case, from i’ve read online, i may be able to go to my county court house clerk about a tenant assertion, affectively diverting my lease payments to the court instead of the landlord. Is that the best course of action/should i do that? Is there anything else I should do (like contacting a tenants attorney)?"
393,393,Property management designating separate broker not listed in lease (CO),"I'm renting a property in Colorado. The landlord went into foreclosure on the house and the auction is next month. The landlord hired a separate broker not listed in my lease contract to start listing the property for a short sale. This separate broker is hounding us to stage the house and get photographers in and to get a spare key. Our lease specifies our property management company can show the property, but mentions nothing of being able to designate someone else to list the property. Am I allowed to deny entry from this separate broker not listed in my lease agreement?"
394,394,Hospital billing scheduled echocardiogram as emergency medical service? HELP!,"Hello! I went to my PC for heart palps and high heart rate a few months ago. Scheduled an echocardiogram. Fast forward, got a bill for over 5g claiming I received emergency medical services for the echo. The appointment was not even the same week as my PC appointment. It was not at the ED, it was at the hospital in the cath lab. We’ve been given the run around with hospital billing and no one can explain why this is being billed as emergency services but they won’t “recode” the bill.

Where do we go from here?"
395,395,Stolen phone is a civil issue?,"Long story short, lent an ex my second phone when she smashed hers out of anger at me discovering she was cheating, told her until she got a new one. Caught her cheating again last July, broke it off and had my sister (I had her blocked on everything) tell her to return the phone, both my ex and ex's mother stated the phone was going to be returned to my place of work, never happened.

Ex reported me for rape at gunpoint in December, turned the phone in as some sort of evidence. Police say the phone will be returned to her when they're finished processing it since my ex ""advised"" them it was a gift so apparently it's a civil issue even though I've shown them proof that my ex stated ""his phone"" was going to be returned to me.

The phone was purchased online back in like 2017, I dont even remember where I bought it from let alone how to find a receipt so I dont know where to go from here. 

Phone was over $500 at the time, I dont know if it's even worth it to try and get it back. I'm using a very old android atm because they also Seized my S21 in december and I guess is still being processed by CCU for some reason.

So my question is, is the phone worth trying to get back? I have no idea how the legal system works so I don't know if I'd have to pay to take her to court for stolen property. Do I make a stolen property report even though the phone is already in police possession? And would witnesses and the proof of her statements be enough without a receipt?"
396,396,bank account freeze,"Does anyone know if a bank has the right to freeze a bank account for suspicious activity even after I confirm I willingly sent that money and am certain I know where that money is going? 

I sent money to someone I know in Egypt and the bank blocked that. They called me and told me they blocked it because of suspicious activity. I confirmed that it is not and that i know who i am sending it to. They asked me to who and why and where and what the money is being used for. I simply told them that it’s my money and i’m choosing to send it to someone there and that I am confirming that it was me and I was not hacked. They continually asked for all the details which started to irk me because I just confirmed it was me and i know who i’m sending it to, so why do you need to know every other detail about the transaction? I refused to tell them and they proceeded to lock my account for over a month. I called multiple times and they refused to open my account again until I told them why i’m sending that money. At this point i’m furious that I cannot even pay my bills even after confirming that I know where the money is going and I confirm that it was me. 

Is this even legal? To keep someone from their own money that they use to pay bills until they answer why they’re sending that money? Sure I could have told them, but truly, it’s none of anyone’s business why I send money where I do and I don’t know if it’s in their rights to freeze my account and keep me from paying my bills after confirming I did and approve of that transaction and that I know who I am sending it to."

398,398,Friends boyfriend is kicking her out of the apartment and she has no where to go.,Hello I am living in California however my friend is currently in South Dakota. She moved out there with her boyfriend awhile ago and she’s been a stay at home girlfriend since then. Things have gotten bad that he broke up with her and got with a new girl a week later who has a baby. She is currently looking for a job but it will take time before she gets one and can move out. He is trying to kick her out  and have the new girl move in with her baby but my friend doesn’t have money or a support system over in South Dakota so she has no where to go. Flying back to California isn’t an option either since she doesn’t have the money or anyone To take her in. Once she gets a job she’ll be able to move out but it seems he wants her gone as soon as possible.  Is there anything she can do to protect herself from getting kicked out at least until she gets a job and can pay for the rent at a new place?
399,399,Surprise Dental Bill,"Unsure if this is the correct sub for this so please let me know if not.

Back in january i scheduled for wisdom teeth removal and was given an estimate. seeing as how my removal was a month out, i was told that any problems or anything with insurance that would affect my pay would be told to me once i was in the office.

Cut to a month later, and I get to the office, sign my papers and pay my bill, which was less than my original estimate. It's important to note that I had my notebook app out to write down any info i would need to remember, but more specifically I was messaging my partner about my bill and how i was surprised by it.

now cut to current day, very slightly over two months later, and the surgeon sends me a bill for almost 700$, saying my insurance limit has been reached. I cant afford to just pay another unexpected 700$ and I find it weird that I'm being given a bill that I wasnt told would even have a possibility of existing


I contacted insurance and their response is that the surgeon should have told me and if they didnt I need to take itup with them.

What can I do? I've been told this is a HIPAA violation and I can dispute it but i cant seem to found out if thats true. I don't see any reason to pay this bill when I've spent two months believing it was all squared away, and I refuse to believe it took 3 months for them to find out if insurance would cover the deal.

Advice?"
400,400,When Someone unsubscribes from email,"I'm a realtor and my boss asks me to send emails from a different email if they have unsubscribed from the MailChimp one.

401,401,Sister Suing me for Father Listing Me as Sole Beneficiary on his Bank Account,"Long story short- my father suddenly passed away 3 months ago. He was estranged from my older sister for the last 8-10 years and she refused to come visit him in the hospital before he died or was in hospice at our home.

My father did not have a will but did have a brokerage account that was carefully managed, in which he listed me as sole beneficiary. This fact took me several weeks to discover.

In the 2 weeks after my fathers death, I had the sole responsibility of going through all his computers, files and taxes to see if he had a will and discover what assets/debts he had.

My older sister was insistent on having access to my fathers bank account so to be transparent, I sent her screenshots of his balance. I texted her something to the effect of, ""I can't find dad's will yet but I assume that he'd want the 3 of us to split all assets evenly"".

My fathers financial advisor informed me shortly after this that I was the sole beneficiary of the account and my father set the beneficiary in person and gave his advisor several reasons why he wanted me listed as the sole beneficiary and not my siblings. He did this over a year prior to his death and was in good mental standing.

My sister is now claiming because I texted her that "" I assume dad would've wanted us to split everything evenly', that I incriminated myself and she is challenging my position as sole beneficiary in court. I was served with a notice by her lawyer yesterday.

**My question is**: how much damage financially can my sister do legally to me with this lawsuit? Can she drag the lawsuit out for years and simply drain the remainder of the account by costing me legal fees or will a judge simply dismiss this as frivolous and not allow it continue past a certain point? 

I do not want to settle with her. She is wealthy and has benefitted significantly from my fathers financial help over the years as to where my brother and I did not. She is going to receive a more than fair portion of the estate when all is said and done.

Points to mention:

\-My father was in good mental standing when he listed me as beneficiary and I had no knowledge of his listing me as beneficiary and did not sway or encourage him to do so.

\-I can get sworn testimony from all my relatives that my dad was not influenced by me or coerced into this action."

403,403,Friend created a website telling people not to use a business; owner threatening to sue,"A couple of years ago my friend hired a cleaning company to clean his house.  They charged him for 17 hours of work and stuck him with almost a $2000 bill.  My friend was appalled at the condition of the house and couldn’t believe how bad of a job they did.  He had primarily hired them to clean up the dog hair from a previous owner and there was still dog hair everywhere.  My friend took pictures of huge clumps of dog hair to document this.

My friend demanded a refund because he could not understand what the 17 hours was spent doing when the house did not look like it had been cleaned at all.  Several Google reviews online from other dissatisfied customers backed up this claim and shared similar stories about astronomically high bills with little results.

My friend created a website called “donothire(business name here)” and documented his experience with them with pictures, urging people not to use their services.  Over the year the comments section received several people commending him for calling attention to this business, once again citing similar stories.

The owner is now threatening to sue and - at the very least - threatening a restraining order.  Before this threat my friend took the site down.

I’m curious: how boned is he?"
404,404,HR Question,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this.

I (in NY) recently went to my HR director to make a complaint about a new manager. It was the first time I’ve ever gone to HR. She asked if she could use my name to escalate the issue because lots of other people complained about the COO but wouldn’t let her use their names. The day after she spoke with the CEO, I was fired. The reason provided was that I was not happy.

Is this legal? It feels like retaliation. Should my manager have had a say in the matter at all? I was never told I could be fired for this and even the HR director was floored. I’m not the only one who complained about the new management structure. I’ve never been spoken to about my performance or ever had any other issues at work."
405,405,Statute of limitations on Social Security Fraud- Complicated issue,"When I was 15, my uncle adopted me legally and was awarded money from social security. This money was from my deceased mother’s accumulated living wages. It was awarded to him as I was a minor and was meant to care for me. 

This living arrangement did not last long however. After 6 months or so I was kicked out of the house over a petty squabble over food. I ultimately became a ward of the state. My uncle no longer had custody of me. I ended up living in a group home until I graduated high school.

I discovered during a visit to my uncle’s house that he was still receiving social security checks. I opened one, as it had my name on it. He was still receiving money from my dead mother’s social security and continued to for about 7 years afterwards.

My grandmother knew about this and said he deserved the money for all of the trouble I caused him. 

My family is full of sociopaths and I have zero contact with them due to this and many other issues. 

Anyway I was wondering if anyone could offer legal advice. If there was anything at all I could do."
406,406,Insurance screwing me over,"I was hit by a vehicle with SF insurance and they deemed my car to be worth 900$ less than what is left on the loan.

Now I am without a vehicle, 900$ in debt and cannot travel to doctors appointments caused from the wreck nor can I go to a job and earn money for another car. Is there any legal course I can take that wouldnt financially ruin me?"

When I was younger I was eligible for a welfare service due to private circumstances and fast forwarding some years later I was officially not eligible anymore for that specific welfare service but my parents still applied for that despite that I'm not eligible. They initially told me that I'll receive the money so I can use it fo my future but after some years my parent told me the truth and that was that I'm not going to receive that money and they really need it due to private circumstances so that's why they applied to the welfare all the time despite I'm not eligible. Now I'm over 18 they can't apply for it anymore and they stopped doing so. They haven't plans to do it in the future as they need my permission and cooperation for this but I won't cooperate because it puts me into great risk that's uneccesary. Now I'm asking myself all the time how I can deal with this situation but I've no idea. I thought of letting it go because they already stopped and won't do it anymore but I'm confused. What's your advice on this? I lastly hope I was specific enough for you to think with me."

I had lost my previous bmw in a no fault accident where i was hospitalized. I went to the dealership because they had a 340i listed for 28,000. I went to finance the car as was told i couldnt afford anything close. A few hours later after speaking with 3 “Managers” They explain i can be apart of a 3 month program for first time buyers. Them and my sales associate said after 3 months with double payments 1000$ the “rental car from the program” would be returned as long as not damaged (still have not found this program to this date April 14/2023. I bring the car after requested by a financial advisor through  text on a friday. I show up she leaves after 20 mins before speaking to me and my new associate says hes done nothing after a hour.

Nothing that was agreed upon on first day. Theres been multiple things as well as coverages that have not led up to true on tires like agreed on the day of purchase.

Of course I would make sure they document that I am not allowed to remove that tree."
411,411,Can’t take possession of car we bought,"In Rhode Island.  A 96 year old lady I met through my job sold me her old car really cheap, she quit driving and wanted it to go to someone who needed it.  We bought it in late February.  We left it in her garage until we got all the paperwork done.  It turned out she couldn’t find the title so we had to wait for that.  Our appointment at DMV got snowed out and it took forever to get another one.  Finally everything is done but she’s disappeared.  I haven’t heard from her since the weekend before Easter.  I called Easter weekend to tell her we could finally pick it up and no answer.  I went over there a couple days later.  No answer, Fed Ex package on front door stoop since Friday.  Neighbors haven’t seen her and mentioned her porch light hasn’t been on at night.  I called the cops, they had the fire department break in but she wasn’t there.   They had been no emergency calls.  I called local hospitals.   I don’t think she would leave to visit anyone, she was paranoid about leaving to go to the grocery store.  

So how do I get my car?  If she does turn up dead somewhere, how do I get notified?  I know the bank she used, I saw her lawyers name written down but can’t remember it.  How do I make sure that people know the car is in my name now?  Should I talk to the people at the bank because sooner or later they would be notified.  The police haven’t called me back."
412,412,Had a vehicle repo 12 years ago. Now collections is coming after me for full amount plus interest.,"As embarrassing as this is to post for anyone and everyone to see online, here’s my story:
I had a repo about 10-12 years ago. I was a very young man with no real life experience at the time, took out a small loan on a car and unfortunately fell into a situation where I simply just couldn’t make the payments. I had the car for less than a year when I decided the best choice was to turn it back in.
Well, I was clueless about what to do. I let the plaintiff and the law system take complete advantage of me. I had made a couple payments but always felt that it wasn’t fair and just stopped paying altogether. Since then, the loan has been sold by the bank to one or more collections agencies and, recently, one of them has been sending me letters for an amount that is the highest I’ve ever seen it.
I have a family (3 children and a baby soon to be born) for which my paychecks provide for. I budget very responsibly to make my life work and I basically live week to week on my checks with barely enough to contribute to a savings, if anything at all on a lucky month.
I know the bank and the collections agency don’t need my money anywhere near as much as my children and I do. Looking back, I want to cry for and fight for my younger self having had nobody to look after me in that situation. Poor kid. I would never let something like this happen to my children.
Is there anything that I can do to get out of this? I’m being 100% honest here when I say I cannot afford this and I do not feel that it’s right that I should have to pay this substantial amount of money for a car I had for maybe ten months.

416,416,Work for big corporation and think I’m being targeted,"Ive had trouble with management after a few months of joining they replaced my old team leader and the treatment has been worse since, he was a welder like me then got promoted to this position, everything was fine until the apprentices from another site, the same site my team leader came from, and who used to work with them came. Everything changed after that all the work I was doing was taken away from me and gave to the apprentices for weeks and then months this when on. As the days when on I became more and more stressed and sleep got so bad that I would of been lucky to get at least 2hrs a night and waking knowing I’d be spending my day trying to occupy myself as little to no work was given or any work I was given any undesirable work that other didn’t want. 

Things got that bad I was suffering severe migraines for weeks at a time and started to get physically sick on a regular basis to the point I missed days of work and lost wages which just added to my anxiety. So I decided I get help and went to my doctor and I’m now in the process of getting an ADHD diagnosis and finding out that the effects of being starved of work or and any form of cognitive challenges has a massive negative effect on my mental and physical well-being all so my team leader could look after his mates at the expense of me. I have always worked with my hands and worked hard and now I know it’s because I needed to. So after I got some help things started to get a bit easier as the more I got to understand what was happening to me, I make all the changes I could to improve my condition and after some time off for Christmas holidays I came back to work like a new man until things when back to normal, 

I was asked to if I would help the company out and go to a supplier company that were behind on main production parts that we needed to start a machines so it was a big deal. 

so 4 others and myself when and after a few days I got a text message from team leader asking did you have to be spoken to by James to which I replied “no who is James? no-one has said anything to me”then he replied telling me that James was approached by the supplier company’s management and told him to have a word with me as I was supposed to be standing chatting and not working, which I knew was untrue so I got really upset at this and decided to go and investigate for myself before I contacted my team leader again. I went straight to management of the supplier and got all three of them to the one side and told them that I had been reported to my management and asked why and if they had any concerns that they could come to me directly, to there bewilderment they did not have any knowledge of this and were quick to tell that it couldn’t be father from the truth and that they were more than happy with my work and I haven’t lifted my head since I started. They even reassured me that they would contact the top management to let them know as much.

I asked them who James was to find out that he was one of my fellow employees that came up from another site that so happened to work with my team leader the same one that messaged me so with this information I rang my team leader to see what this was all about for having my work ethic questioned and being made to feel I was trouble was stressing me to no end, when I rang I asked him where did this come from and he told me that it came from top management and that it was the suppliers top management that reported to them, which was a complete lie and found that it was in fact james a young lad in his 20s that was sending this misinformation to which my team leader tried to cover for aswel feel the need to attack me and make me feel shit so I’m sure that not know things should be. So I contacted management above him and told him everything and asked that he report it so I continued to work a few weeks with the supplier before going back to main site, once I got there I confronted him about everything and again stuck to his lie and told me I was lucky to have a job but I told him I was going to management about it and he changed his tune so I thought I’d give him a second chance. 
I returned back to work with good reports of my work with the supplier to be put into a role with added responsibilities and increased work load instead of being moved to price work which is where the most money is made as you payed for the work you produce instead of an hourly rate, I have been doing the role for few months without anyone explaining why or any training for the new role for to then find out that the same apprentices that got all my production work, that would of progressed me onto price work, we’re getting put on price work before me and and that I would be doing this new demanding role from now on I was then told that everyone was impressed my work and efforts in this new role but when I asked if I would be getting a pay increase. I was told no that there would be nothing extra for the role I then told my management that I would have to decline the role as they know i joined for the purpose of getting on to price work I was told they would see what they can do, this was weeks after and still no communication, so I started to feel once again I had been forgotten about so I messaged my manager to express my concerns with how I’ve been treated and the effects it’s having on my mental health and that I would like a meeting to get this addressed.

My manager then rang me screaming and swearing at me down the phone telling me that he had never heard such nonsense in his life and that I was Lucky to have a job and that if I wanted a meeting with HR that he will arrange it and that HR would side with him.

I was completely shocked at this and have been going out my mind since and I’m starting to feel that management has been part the problem the whole time, he  is the manager that I have been reporting my team leader to and since I got back, I have heard nothing about the incident. I asked him to report.

So, if anybody could please give me anything that might help as I don’t want lose my job or have my mental health continue to deteriorate. I feel so lost. I have no one to turn to I cannot go to management and it also seems that HR is also on their side. I have a lot of people depending on me and alI I want is to work in peace and be treated the same as anyone else, I work hard, and do more overtime than anyone else as well as any job that is asked of me and any work I produce is of a good quality so my work is never questioned so I don’t understand why this is going on 

Any help or advice would be much appreciated thanks in advance"

This happened in June, 2020

EDIT: It's not clear, but the tree belongs to us.  The city had an easement to work on the drainage.

Behind our house, there had been an ongoing drainage issue caused by poor draining from a new road that was finally rectified in 2020. I won't go into the details of this work, other than it was necessary, and it resolved a massive issue with sinkholes appearing in our neighbors yard.

During the construction, the plans clearly indicated that a ... i don't know 10-12' diameter? ... oak was supposed to be protected space. It's huge.

The city contractor repeatedly drove over the dripzone, compacting the earth, parked land-moving vehicles next to the tree, compacting the earth, and left concrete pipes on the dripzone, again, compacting the earth.  They also ran into this tree several times.

I have photographic and video evidence of this damage and behavior.

I also have a string of text messages (and emails) with city representatives about my concern about this tree, and repeated requests to follow up with regards to examining the health of the tree, including one from last year, stating that the tree is not dead.

This tree is dead. it still has old leaves on it from last year and has not started sprouting new ones.

My ultimate goal here is to just ensure that i have this tree taken care of before it falls on my house.

I'm also pretty mad / sad that the damage was done - we really loved that tree.

Thank you!"
418,418,Retaining wall upkeep,"New Jersey

I bought a property that has a retaining wall with an ownership dispute. In short, a small portion of the wall resides on my property, a slightly larger piece is on the property line, and the bulk is on my neighbors side. The wall is failing and needs repair or replacement.

My question isn't about the outcome of who owns the wall, which is a complicated issue (for what it's worth, I've tried repeatedly to offer a 50/50 arrangement with my neighbor; he declines) but what the resolution could be. 

This wall has clearly been neglected, and my neighbor has lived in his house for 20+ years. If a judge was to rule that we are both 50% responsible for the upkeep and/or replacement or repair of the wall, would any of my liability be prorated because of the length of time he neglected to do any repairs or upkeep on his portion, or will we just have to split the cost down the middle?"
419,419,[NJ] Question about commercial tenant and extending leases,"I am a property manager that helps with individual owners. I saw in an initial commercial tenant lease that 

"" **Option.** Tenant is granted an option to renew the Lease for an additional three (3) years. The rent for the option period is shall be paid as set forth herein below. Tenant must exercise the option by giving written notice to Landlord prior to September 1, 2020. Jan 1, 2021 through January 31, 2024  $XXX payable on the first day of each month in advance. ""  

The tenant on August 2020 sent in certified mail and altered the lease terms giving himself an additional extension of 3 years to 2027. The owner never agreed to or countersigned this lease but continued to take rent. It was the intention by the owner that the tenant be on month to month from Jan 1 2021. At what point does the tenant have the right to legally stay? Thanks."
420,420,"Leased office modified, after water damage, to be drastically different from when we signed","Hello,

Long story short, a pipe burst in the 2nd floor office in our building. The entire building got flooded and everything had to be demo'd and reconstructed. We just checked our office today, which is days away from finishing and being ready for reoccupation, and we noticed that the floor is drastically different from when we signed the place.

Before, it has Luxury Vinyl Plank Flooring (LVP) but it now has polished concrete flooring. The feel of the office is very different now. It went from an office feeling to a contruction/tech firm feel. 

Is this allowed? Do we have any say in requesting the place to be restored to how it originally looked?

422,422,Bedbug infestation in Baltimore on an existing lease that I was added to,"I am attending a school in Baltimore and we've been a victim of a bed bug infestation basically since the moment I arrived and likely before, IDK exactly. It was not me my Romanian household is beyond clean, my roommate is simply immune to them or some shit he claims and the rest of the guys are legitimately stupid and/or don't care, so IDK what to do with them. The lease has been active for 3 years from an initial set of tenants who have now moved out, a new set is living there now for their second year, and I've joined the lease this past year, along with a couple of others. Given that my roommate is ""immune"" and I experienced issues immediately upon moving in, therefore it likely isn't my fault, who the fuck is at fault?! My housemates keep saying there's nothing they can do because they lease is active from before they moved in, therefore the bed bugs must be one of our faults and the landlord isn't liable, that the bed bugs came AFTER the creation of the lease, but that makes sense in an individual basis, where a family or a single individual are/is (a) tenant(s). What about in a case like this where the lease is historic, the bed bugs are NOT my fault, but are instead the fault of ""previous"" tenants who may or may not still be living here? How the fuck could I be subject to a lease that existed before my involvement as a conscious agent? If that were to really apply to me then it seems reasonable that I also pay two years of rent for the two years of active lease that I'm supposedly subject to, but that's obviously insane because I didn't live here and had no contract or connection in any capacity, but this they clearly don't understand as an argument against their defeatist conclusions. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated, I don't care if I have to beat the landlord, the roommate, or the housemates into submission, I just want the fucking bedbugs gone at the cost of the people RESPONSIBLE so that I can finally go home over the holiday breaks rather than staying in this shithole to preserve the risk of transfer.

&#x200B;

TLDR (because I suck at writing with efficiency and lack of emotion): I was added to lease in which bed bugs already exist, either from before the lease or from the people under the lease before I was added. My housemates say there's nothing that can be done and don't want to pay, and further say that I am also responsible for contributing to the cleanup. WTF do I do?"
423,423,Contractor Dispute,"In NY.  Contracted with a company to do a small concrete job.  Signed a very amateur contract last fall and provided 25% deposit.  Contractor built steps crooked.  I notified contractor before the forms were removed.  Contractor ""prefers to address (corrected in subsequent text to ""discuss"") and issues after the job is complete.  Makes excuses why they can't come look at the problem, keeps pushing back any discussion.  I threaten to stop payment on the check for roughly 70% of total payment (this is my only leverage).  I made clear that I intend to pay, but issue needs to be addressed first.  Contractor flips out, tells me they won't come back and tells me to sue them (with lots of colorful language).

Job is roughly half finished.  Stopped payment on the check so I'm only out the 25% deposit.  I'm not looking to recoup any of the deposit.  I'm slightly concerned that the contractor will come after me for the 70% even though the job was not completed (although this has not happened yet).  One option is we offer to pay for the work done (which obviously is going to be biased in favor of the contractor) to avoid any potential litigation.  Or should we just cut contact and move on?  Is it worth consulting a lawyer at this point or just wait it out?"

They sent instructions about how to administer the medication. I’m comfortable getting them in a safe space and calling their parents if a situation arises, but I’d like to know if I’m putting myself in a legal weird spot if I administer the medication and cause harm in so doing. Would a simple contract absolving me (and my employees) of fault be accepted legally? Is this actually a non-issue?

429,429,Mom put deposit on new home construction. Walked in to it partially flooded. Can she get her deposit back?,"Hi All!  On cell phone so apologies for formatting. 

My mom put a $60,000 deposit down on a new construction house in Sarasota County FL. She checked in on it while it was being built. Last week, she went in and the bathroom was flooded. She notified the builder and they said the water was turned off when the toilet was flushed causing the flooding. *This sounds like BS to me. 

She returns the next day to find additional rooms flooded. She was now told it was the hot water heater leaking. Later, she was told it was the water line to the refrigerator, which somehow ran through the entire house but was also assured that the refrigerator water line was not under the floor. (!?!)  So I guess it’s suspended in the middle of the room and is actively leaking but no one noticed?!?

At another point my mom was told by the builder the water was coming up from the ground as the house almost flooded during hurricane Ian but didn’t. 

Long story short, my mom no longer wants to buy the house under any circumstances. In FL one must disclose if a house has EVER had water damage and they will likely not be able to sell the house because of that. The slimy lawyer for the house builder told my mom that because she didn’t technically own the house at the time of the flooding, she didn’t have to disclose any knowledge of it – I think this shows how reputable the company is.

So, the home builder’s lawyer says my Mom is shit out of luck. They will keep her $60k deposit, resell the house for more money, and never disclose the water damage. 

My mom doesn’t like to make waves so she is willing to take a $60k hit. She was a public school teacher her whole life and this pains me so much for her. 

She doesn’t like confrontation and doesn’t want to get a lawyer involved. Yet, she trusts the home builder’s lawyer who says she can’t get her deposit back. 

I know these contracts are written to protect the builder, but might there be a defects clause, or a flooding clause (this is FL) that might let her out of the contract and let her get her deposit back?

She is not open to buying the house and reselling or renting. She is not really open to ANY outside the box thinking. She just wants to walk away regardless of the financial cost. 

Anyone out there know if there might be any chance for her to get her deposit back?  Or any ideas to mitigate a $60k loss?  For most of her life, she never even made $60k / year, which is also my current annual salary. It’s just so painful to see her lose so much when she did nothing wrong. 

Any advice is welcome!"

431,431,[MA] Character and Fitness Application Question,"Apologies if this is not the correct place for this question.

I am currently applying for the Bar Exam and I was wondering if anyone could provide some clarity to one of the following C+F questions, see below:

*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*

I have received 5 traffic tickets (3 speeding; 1 cell phone; 1 inspection sticker) that would all be considered civil infractions and not misdemeanors/felonies over the course of about 12 years.

For the three speeding tickets, I disputed them in court, meaning I made an actual appearance in court and was able to successfully get them reduced to a lesser charge. Since I was a party in a legal proceeding, I would assume I would have to disclose these; which is fine, I know they are not something that are going to DQ me.

For the one inspection sticker ticket and cell phone ticket, I did not dispute them and I just paid the fine, meaning I did not appear in court regarding these tickets. Does this technically mean I was not a party in a legal proceeding? I will likely just err on the safer side and disclose regardless but I am just genuinely curious."

When I went to the emergency room I was charged $500 for them to clean and dress the wound and fill out a report to animal control. I spoke to a high profile injury attorney. They informed me my medical bills were too low for them to take the case. Understandable. I have the owner of the pit bulls information. I reached out yesterday and asked to speak with them.

433,433,Expected Wait Times?,"Not a legal question...more of a question on what to expect from your own lawyer question.

I am starting a business, and started working on this at the beginning of March. While it will be a non-medical company, it is in the health field. I knew I would need a lawyer to cover myself and make sure I was doing some things correctly.

I had my first meeting with them on 3/29. They were impressed with everything I came in with already prepared, and all the info I already had. They said they were not used to most people being this well prepared, let alone a new business owner. I decided I would like to have them as my lawyer. They said they would work on an Operating Agreement for my LLC, put together a client contract for me, and then asked me to send them the three policies I already made myself (and needed to apply for licensure) for them to look over. They did let me know they would be on vacation 4/3-4/7.

Also, at the time of our meeting, I let them know that the ONLY thing I was waiting on to apply for licensure was to secure a surety bond (required by my state), and that I wanted to apply for licensure as soon as I was able. I finally got that at the end of last week.

On Sunday, I sent an email to them letting them know I have the surety bond and would drop copies of that paperwork off for their file, that I had dropped off other paperwork the week before, and asked them if they could look at the three policies I had made first (in regards to everything they were doing for me), so I could get my licensure application submitted. I dropped off my papers on Monday. By Wednesday, I still had not heard anything. I called and left a message with their receptionist along the same lines of needing word back on my policies so I can submit my licensure application. It is now Friday, and I still have heard nothing...no phone call or email.

I know I am not the only client, and I do not expect same day turn around. But I am wondering how long is reasonable to expect to wait for them to just look at it? Or even just some contact giving me an idea of when to expect to get it back? I really cannot move forward or do anything else with my business until I apply for the license. It has been a bit over two weeks since our meeting, and they've been back in the office a full week now.

I am seriously thinking about just applying for the licensure before even hearing back from them...and potentially looking for a new lawyer if it's taking awhile, and not having really any communication. :("

i recently saw their daughter for the first time since she was a kid.. she just turned 9 yesterday. she tells me that her dad hits her mom, and how he always comes home drunk. she tells me she has to pretend to love her dad or else “bad things will happen”. she tells me she remembers bad things from her childhood.. and when i ask her what memories she has, she says she doesn’t remember. she tells me her family fat shames her. she tells me she can’t communicate with her parents. 

to put it in perspective, her father is an alcoholic that came from vietnam so he doesn’t speak any english. her mom, is mentally not there so she can’t communicate. her father also takes her mom’s disability checks for himself.

she’s told me that her mom tried to commit suicide from the abuse from her dad. i’ve grown up with her mom and it doesn’t sit right with me that my cousin would ever have the mental capacity to try to harm herself like that. idk. she’s using so many curse words at such a young age and tells me “my parents don’t understand what im saying so..” and then tells me that she had to go to summer school but since her parents don’t know english she didn’t go.

It takes months of training before we can work in production and the turnover at this company over the course of 6 months is literally 85%.

443,443,"Tow truck charging $4,000, is this an unreasonable rate?","To clarifying, I will not be paying this fee, my insurance will. 

This story takes place in California.

The last 2 weeks trying to get my car out of this tow lot have been a total shit show. 2 weeks ago my parked car was hit by a drunk driver at 3am. He hit 6 cars total, including mine, and likely totalled every single one of them. My car? I don't fucking know if it's totalled or not because it's still sitting in the tow lot 2 weeks later.

I called for a primary tow the day of the accident, 8 hours later no one showed up, and I had to call another tow company. By that time, the body shop it was meant to go to was closed and they didn't have after hours drop off, so the tow company took it to their storage lot, 17 miles away. My insurance agent promised it would be taken to the body shop the next morning.

For some reason, that never happened. A week later, my agent calls the tow company asking where my car is and they claim to never have towed it. Absolutely wild because they gave me a receipt for the tow. They wouldn't even look for it until I sent video evidence that my car was towed by their company (thank God we had that video). 

At this point, the tow company quotes my agent about $2k in storage fees and is now claiming they never lost my car and it was always in their books and on their lot. She says she'll get them the money, but for some reason that never happens and my car is still on this lot of another week.

I get a call yesterday asking when we'll be sending someone to pick up my car and im like ????????? I thought it was at a body shop this whole time?? The tow company says they were never paid and won't release my car until they are. The tow company won't tell me the cost of releasing my car, but my agent informs me they're asking for well over $4,000 and ""we will not be paying that"".

I want to report the towing company to the BBB, but I've never had my car towed before, let alone left it in storage for 2 weeks. I know towing companies are notoriously shady. I just want my fucking car off that lot and to find out if I need to start looking for a new car or not, but since I have 0 control over any of that, am I able to do anything legally about this company?

446,446,"Friends horse was stolen, officer said they can't get her back","So, my friend has a horse who they've had for over 10 years. She's had a bad injury that prevented them from riding her. They kept her as healthy/comfortable as humanely possible and even had a surgery done years ago to minimize any pain the horse might be feeling.

A month ago they noticed the horse was in way too much pain and felt it was ethical to euthanize her. It was an extremely painful decision, this horse has been a huge part of their life. 

Right before the veterinarian came, a woman stole the horse from the property they were keeping her and contacted them saying the horse was fine. This woman claims the horse is completely healthy and wouldn't acknowledge the pain she is in. She basically told them that *she* will let them know when *she* feels like it's time to euthanize and let them know so they can say goodbye.

My friends contacted the authorities of course, but they said since the horse is on private property, they can't do anything about it. That can't be right! I don't know exactly what kind of documentation of ownership they have, but I know there's years of veterinary records with the horses photo attached, shipping records, etc. 

They think the horse might've been harmed further by being moved to a new property. I think my friend feels dumb trying to lawyer up to get a horse back just to put her down, but this has been painful enough before she was stolen. They wanted to make a humane choice and had veterinarian consent to do so. It's like their choice to say goodbye has been taken from them and it's horrible. 

Is there anything that can be done for this situation?

Forcing me to park in a far away employee lot on other side of hospital.,"I am a young, healthy looking employee with a handicap placard. I have an artificial hip and a metal rod holding my femur together- but I don't walk with a limp. However walking long distances often results in  me being unable to fall asleep as pain seems to creep up on me in the evening.

My employer (a hospital) is requiring all employees to park in a certain lot, which happens to be on the other side of the hospital from my office. 

I started parking in a patient lot as there are numerous handicapped parking spots there, and they are never fully filled. A parking attendant saw me park, recognized me and chastised me for parking in a handicapped spot. After I told her I had a placard, she still told me I am not allow to be in this lot.

I don't know if I should press the issue, any insights or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe Im the asshole."
448,448,Collision shop has been making repairs on my car for 4 months and keeps lying,"I reside in Wayne County, Michigan. 

In December I got into a collision while driving in icy/snowy conditions. I hit a median and my rear left got badly damaged. I submitted a claim through to my insurance the same day. 

Between working with insurance and looking up and calling places, I was able to find the collision shop i ultimately took my car into. I brought my car in for an inspection and they gave me a quote shortly after and said if I wanted to get my car fixed with them they would need to order the parts and that it would take two weeks to fix my car. I was able to keep my car with me (but couldn't drive it much since the car wasn't ""street legal"" due to the taillight being broken off)  until they received the parts which was about a week and a half later. 

I dropped off my car at the date they gave me and picked up the rental car that my insurance issued me. About a week and a half into the repairs they said that a part they ordered still hasn't arrived and that it might take another week or two. 

Long story short, they keep telling me this part would come in until I escalated this missing part story to the insurance agent that represented the collision shop (a few weeks later). I was then told that this part was out of stock and that no one has been able to get it. At this point I had to turn in my rental because my 30 day rental policy was over and I'm not in a position financially to be renting a car indefinitely. 

After a few more weeks, I decided to call Subaru who is the manufacturer of my car and I told them about the situation and asked if there was anything that could be done. The person I spoke to was able to locate a part and then followed up with me via email saying they shipped this part with next day delivery to the collision shop. 

In this time, i asked the collision shop if they could write me a letter for work explaining why i didnt have a car and they refused to (i asked about five times). I then asked if I could inspect and possibly keep the parts from my vehicle and they told me they threw them all away (and I know that's illegal - at least in michigan). 

Fast forward to this past week, I was told by the collision shop that my car would be ready today. I called asking for an update the day before and they told me it would take me an additional week and a half until I could get my car back because they keep ""finding more things to repair."" I asked to speak to the owner and we have a ""fun"" conversation. I asked her why it was taking so long if they overnight shipped my part to them a month ago and the original time frame was two weeks to repair my entire vehicle assuming parts were delivered. The owner told me they took two weeks to receive the part from subaru, I then told her I have an email from them confirming it was delivered the next day. 

I then asked why they kept saying why the part was missing even though I was able to get it the next day from the manufacturer. She told me that they arent allowed to contact the manufacturer directly (i dont understand this one but whatever). She then proceeded to tell me that she has had cars sitting in her shop for 6+ months with the same situation, then i asked why she didnt tell me or those other customers to talk to the manufacturer directly instead of constantly making us wait. She told me it wasn't her job... 

I also asked about the parts they threw away and then she said she would call me back. They ended up finding those parts. 

I had a consultation with a lawyer and he pretty much said the only thing he could do is write a letter asking them to make the repairs in a timely manner and that I couldn't do much cause they found the parts they originally lost. 

My question is: is there anything I can legally do? I still don't gave my car, I'm losing money on work because there is only so much I can do from home (I'm lucky to even negotiate that with my supervisor), and I'm spending so much money on rental cars every time I go out. I've also reached out to the insurance but they don't seem to care and keep referring me to the collision shop."
449,449,Roofer/ chimney repair delayed 5 months now…,"(Texas) I feel like I’m getting scammed here… Okay so we have fireplace chimneys that need to be repaired and I got a quote confirmed with them back in October. They said they will do it the week before Christmas and asked for 50% deposit for some supply purchases. We gave it to them of course. They reached out and said they have to push the start date because of bad weather so some projects were delayed and we said no big deal and agreed the for the week after Christmas for the work to be done. That week came and went and no one reached out or anything. They never came to do the work and I tired reaching out with email and phone calls and never got a response. At this point I’m thinking I got scammed. Well I finally get a response after the holidays with them saying oh we didn’t take any of our work stuff with us and we were out of town for the holidays and our truck broke down. (It’s a small family company that was referred to us by the local fireplace store. ) I’m like okay strange but bad luck on the truck I guess… they said we are first in line once the truck is fixed. I said okay home everyone is okay since the trucks engine caught fire. Two weeks go by and I don’t hear anything and I reach out and he says okay be there X day or whatever and then his daughter breaks her arm. Long store short now…he has been out twice to our house to do work but he needs to finish the main bulk of the work that we initially called him out for still and every time there is an excuse or some reason he can’t come… either health issues with him or his family, weather is too windy or there is a chance of rain or he doesn’t have workers to help. It’s been one excuse after another. Back in Jan I told him I’m done and wanted my money back before he did any work and he said he couldn’t give anything back bc he purchased supplies already. I’ve been very nice and thinking maybe he is just having bad luck. But this week was perfect weather and no one came out and today he said there is a chance of rain so he isn’t coming. I’m done at this point and want to know how to get money back for the work not done. The work he has done has been very minimal and doesn’t come close to covering the money we put down. He has only been out for maybe 3 hours total."
450,450,House stuck in buyout limbo due to park its in closing. I'm in Pennsylvania,"

I bought my home in February 2020. Presently I'm stuck in an ongoing buyout process. 

The land the park sits on is currently waiting to be sold to a warehouse development group. Through 2021 and 2022 Estes Trucking had attempted to buy the land but were shut down by the Township due to zoning issues and they ultimately ended up purchasing a warehouse somewhere else. 

Last August I had reached an agreement of sale with a buyer for the amount of $79,900 after fees etc. A few days before closing one of the lawyers for the land owners got involved and refused the buyers a lease to live there and the sale had to be declined despite the check being in escrow. 

Not long after a letter was posted stating the park would be closing March 7th of this year. In the letter it mentioned by law any home that couldn't be moved was allowed to be appraised at fair market value. I went this route and the home appraised at $72,000. I was told by one of the lawyers that payments would not happen until after March 7th.

March 7th has past and recently a letter was sent to a lawyer who has been assisting people who got buyouts from the park owners lawyer in which he accused the apprasier of not appraising the homes correctly and that they were seeking help from a used home specialist to redo appraisals. Also the lawyer stated that he was open to negotiating with people. I sent a letter to open negotiations only to have a automated reply tell me he's on Vacation till May 1st. 

That's where I'm at presently no clue how to proceed other then getting tied up in some class action suit. 

Any advice would be appreciated

There's so much more to this apologies if I did not make the situation total clear."

452,452,"During a divorce, are you allowed to ask spouse for the expenses that you spend?",I'm not getting any legal advice or guideline but my sister is going thru a divorce with her husband but they have both been living separate for the past year. Her husband is kinda abusive and was torturing emotionally mentally. Sometimes she felt scared to live with him because of anger and mood. He put his hands on her twice but my sister never reported to the police as she was scared of her relationship causing more problems and being worried what the society might say if she did take any action. So because of all this stuff they both lived in separate states until recently she received ex parte temporary order for divorce. He wants to get a divorce and move on. Unfortunately my sister doesn't have proper guideline on what her legal rights are. Her husband doesn't want to pay money for the things she has done. Like my sister got married in her country and she is u.s citizen but husband has green card. So my sister spend a lot of money with the paperwork for immigration and for the fees and greencard. She even was paying for the car and cell phone services but her husband just wants to deny from paying any expenses. His intentions were only to come to this country and get permanent residence. My sister feels like he has done fraud marriage to obtain residency here. She is not able to afford lawyer or attorney and doesn't know what to do next. She feels hopeless

455,455,I don’t think my attorney did much for me,"So I hired an attorney through a company  last month  to represent me in court for family legal matters I paid the 5000 retainer fee and we spoke on the phone for the 1st and last time on March 7th for no more than 5 minutes 

I gave him the run down of everything I knew because I didn’t know very much. I only know that I had mediation on the 17th of March and court on April 20th  because i had got a letter in the mail on March 4th from court  letting me know the other party went to court without me present and that they had no  proof that the petitioner served me.

On March 16th i got a call from the paralegal, and we spoke for a short period of time as well I gave her the case number and I guess since me and the other party are not married the case is not public for them to see so she had asked me for the other parties information (name and phone number)  I gave it to her and she said she will reach out to the other party and tell them to serve the law firm instead of me I had offered to get the paper work myself because I knew if the other party didn’t serve me he for sure wasn’t going to serve them she said no that’s okay he needs to serve the serve the law firm  and i said okay  and that was  pretty much the entire conversation.

So on April 7th I had called the law firm and I left a voice mail and asked them if  the other party served them she called back on April 10th and said no he did not court is next week on the 20th and a response has not been filed and they have no clue what is going on and neither did I until later that day on April 10th when I went up to the court building and got the paper work myself 

I went and found another lawyer that was right across the street from the court building  to see if they could take my case at such short notice and he agreed

So now I am curious can I get a refund from the attorney that I previously hired 

P.S Yes I know the other party still must serve me or my lawyer but me getting the paperwork for them would have at least gave them and myself  an idea of what’s going on and what to prepare for next week on April 20th"
456,456,Basement flood!,"Hello,

It all started when I hired a legitimate heating/cooling company to do a yearly inspection of my a/c unit. He came and looked over my  a/c ended up using my broken hose without asking for permission which ended up causing a pipe to burst causing my basement to flood.   


When I moved into the house the water Spicket was already installed and on top of the spicket it says freeze free. Also the water to both outside spickets are/were turned off before winter. This guy I guess needed to use the spicket and hose as part of the a/c inspection. So the broken pipe was leaking water and I use that word (leaking) very loosely water for around 30mins. There was damage to my personal property, to the wall, baseboard, and the water leaked into one of the other bedrooms and into the rug. The basement is finished. 

I ended up talking to this guys supervisor and they said this incident happens at least once a year.  We were able to clean the water up and get one fan down there. We had to call a plumber which there was an extra fee due to after hour, and a water restoration  company. Plus our home insurance company. From what was said this company has opened up a claim. is there anyway other advice I need to do in this situation?"

At my school, a staff member is giving a tattoo to a minor student during school hours. The student is 17 and does not have parental consent. They are also not-formally trained and I believe they are doing the tattoo in the art room.

458,458,Aggressive Dog in my neighborhood,"In the last couple of weeks, I’ve started noticing a new dog and owner in our neighborhood. Every time this dog encounters my dog and I, another dog and owner, or just another person, it immediately begins to exhibit dangerous behavior. It will lunge, snarl, and bark in a way that really concerns me if it were to come off leash. From what I’ve seen, it doesn’t look like the owner is doing much to actively train the reactivity.  I understand that some dogs have behavioral issues (we’ve dealt with some of our own!) and not all dogs have the best leash manners. However, these interactions are becoming a safety concern to me. Best case scenario I’m worried that our walks will no longer be peaceful, and worst case scenario someone could get seriously hurt. Is there anything I can do legally or otherwise?"

Last October I was going to visit my family late at night when I had to return home pretty suddenly almost at their home. I noticed i was being followed by the police and decided to go a different way then just immediately back onto the interstate. I will admit that when they suddenly decided to pull me over i did run from them. I was involved in a major wreck during the space of the chase and was in the hospital for well over a month. During that time I called lawyers and the police department multiple times along with family members calling on my behalf to find my items like my id and phone. I also wanted to know what would be done with me considering I did run from the police. According to the lawyers and even the police I called, I should of been arrested in the hospital. I was released after being in there for over a month and continued to go to rehab and work my way towards getting my life back every single day for more months until we are now. I suddenly find myself with my picture blasted across the news station claiming far more charges and claiming I fled the hospital and cops was unable to find me. I intend on turning myself in because they now have an arrest warrant out after a news station started investigating at someone else's insistence. My top points and questions are 

1. They claim they couldn't arrest me becasue they couldnt  find me after i was released from the hospital after 2 weeks but i was in the hospital for over a month. Could they not of arrested me in the hospital within 48 hours of me being awake from my major injuries?
2. They had my address and phone number but no one tried to come find me even if they was searching for me. They refused to provide a case number when asked during repeated calls, by myself lawyer and friends and family, until literally yesterday. I feel like they didn't intend on pursuing the matter at all until this case was complained about to the news and they investigated into the matter. 
3. I always thought and believed based on others i know of, that there is channels to go through for the police to arrest you while youre in the hospital and put you under some type of lock and key.
4. I have a lot of evidence that i did try to get this taken care of 6 months ago and fully expected to be arrested then and then when it didn't just carried on living a normal life of trying to recover and get better for my family. I also can prove some of the cops claims to be lies. 
5. is there any way that my evidence of cop mishandling my case help me to reduce or remove the charges thats wrong by not showing the news, or would it be better to clear the public portion of my name with the evidence of their mishandling going to the news that first ran my story

&#x200B;

im sure theres more and you can ask me anything and ill answer to the best of my ability. this is all just a shock to me and ive been awake all night trying to process and figure out a way forward."
460,460,Possible assault? Ex stuck their finger in my mouth while arguing about possessions.,"I (edit: 47f) moved out of my ex's (edit: 43 m2f) apartment this month. I am slowly moving things out. They refused to put me on the lease, but I lived there from 11/6/2020-4/1/2023. (Edit: They broke up with me in June 2022, but I have been sick and had a hysterectomy in late January due to a massively enlarged uterus).

I was looking through the kitchen for some of my stuff and they accused me of stealing food (edit: something they would never buy or eat). They have been trying to get me to leave behind all the valuables I purchased since moving in, like a (edit: portable) dishwasher and (edit: portable) laundry dryer. I told them I had receipts for all this stuff (and bank records of most of the money I sent over many years) and was trying to be honest and fair.

They advanced their finger towards me and put it in my mouth, which I didn't think they'd really do so I didn't try to escape. To avoid biting them, I moved so that their finger went in my cheek. They then hooked their finger behind my back right molar and commented on how I had my wisdom teeth removed. I don't remember if I stepped backwards or if they removed their finger.

They had said something during the argument about needing 48 hours notice to come get my stuff when I mentioned possible civil charges for all the things I paid for and money I spent on them.

After the finger, I quickly grabbed a few things and got out. I mentioned how bad their finger tasted to lighten the situation. I asked if they were serious about the 48 hour notice and they said just text first next time.

My current partner (edit: 46m) is furious and is calling it rape. I just want all my stuff. Previously we had made agreements about some of the furniture and appliances, but they didn't pay me the money they promised. Instead, they lied about money I owed them.

I am thinking of reporting the assault, which was three days ago.
I also want all my stuff, regardless of previous broken verbal arrangements or possible gifts to them to try to placate them.

They are a drug addict and have guns, but are basically non-violent.

I have no clue what to do.

Thank you.

Edit: I forgot to mention, this is Tucson AZ USA."
461,461,Is this slander ? Cleaning service threatens to publish a reputation damaging review on website,"We hired a cleaning service to clean our restaurant (Austin, TX). For the most part, the job was done almost as described. The summary is we asked them to come back and clean what was left plus other items that were not initially included in the job. They declined and offered a discount. We rejected the discount and only paid half of the invoice.

After standing our grounds for refusing to pay then, we received an email from owner threatening to publish pics of the job before and after along with factual information about the restaurant and names of the owner and manager who were involved. All of that was in the email. All info seems to be accurate but publishing such review will be reputation damaging to the restaurant as the ""before pics"" are troubling.  If this actually happens, do we have grounds for a lawsuit? They threaten to publish review on all of their social media platform!"
462,462,Hospital Problem,"Hi! I am going to try to type this as best as I can, I am still fuming over this incident: 

Last week, my partner \[23M\]\]and I \[23F\] visited the Emergency Room at a Medical Center in our state. It was the worst emergency room visit that I have ever experienced. Early that morning, my partner, Kevin, was having unbearable stomach pains. He begged me to take him to the emergency room. When we arrived, the nurse at the desk went through a bunch of questions with Kevin. Her attitude was dismissive, but I attributed it to being tired, so I dropped my concern. 

We were taken to the room and were greeted by Dr. “John Smith”. He came in and went through a series of questions. During this, he was rude, to say the least. His tone and his manner were sarcastic. After my boyfriend had said that he smokes marijuana, the doctor was adamant that this was his issue. My boyfriend relayed to him that this was not a common issue and that he has been experiencing this pain since childhood. He explained that it usually happens when he eats something that does not agree with him or it has been set off by high stress. Kevin told the doctor that he was not interested in taking anti-nausea medicine and that he just needed hydration. 

When the nurse brought the IV, she had also brought Reglan, so Kevin let her know that she shouldn’t put that in the IV, and that he was NOT interested in bloodwork. This was to Nurse Natalie. The doctor came back with his snarky attitude, saying, “What’s up man, you don’t *want* *blood work*?” My boyfriend replied that although he would, he does not think anything will come back (and he was right). He knew that the source of his pain and nausea was his stomach. The doctor continued arguing with Kevin about the anti-nausea medication, saying that there were only three choices for him to treat nausea. Kevin said that they all make him react anxiously and that it made him feel uneasy. He said it was an “indescribable discomfort” to both Nurse Natalie and the doctor. The doctor threw his hands up saying that that’s all he had, and to make a choice. Hesitantly, Kevin said that “Zofran was probably best, but I will take what you recommend” and the doctor shot back with, “That’s what I’m trying to do here.” 

When Kevin was given the medication, he began to have a reaction and began to have a panic attack. ANYONE that knows anything about a panic attack KNOWS that the cognitive process becomes rather irrational. He was scared, fearful that he couldn’t breathe, he felt uneasy and was hitting himself, the mattress, and was crying in pain and discomfort. I had to monitor him myself and do breathing exercises with him. During his panic, he yelled out “NURSE!!!” for her (or anyone) to help him. This was because he AND I pressed the button multiple times and no one came. There were a few times I had poked my head out for her, but she always had her back turned talking or was on her computer. I understand the chaos of the emergency room but that night, there did not seem to be much going on. The nurse came in and Kevin was panicking saying, “Oh why did you give this to me?” and “Nurse, I told you that I would have a reaction!” He was not screaming *at* her. This was a cry for help. She mostly ignored him, but said, “I did not force you to take this, it was your choice.” My problem is not what she was saying, but how it was being said. And her demeanor. At a later point, she snapped at Kevin to not yell and “learn to press the button” when he needed her, but she was not even paying attention when we did. We pressed it another time and the nurse made a comment like, “Good job, you learned to press a button”.

The doctor abruptly came in and told Kevin that he needs to calm down. He also told Kevin to stop yelling at the nurses. Kevin and I said that he was just calling for help. There was some back and forth, but Kevin asked the doctor to be nicer to him not once but TWICE, and the doctor said “No” and “No, I don’t need to be”. The doctor said that he had never heard of a bad reaction to Zofran in “all his years” and scoffed at my boyfriend as if he were lying. Kevin replied, “Well, here you go” 

The doctor asked Kevin what he wanted. Kevin asked him for something to help calm him down. The doctor responded with something along the lines of, “Oh, do you now?” As if, he did not believe my boyfriend. He also implied that this always happens when patients smoke weed and have a reaction. Again, we told the doctor that this was not weed-induced. He then had the nurse give him HALDOL. This made him worse. At this point, he is hungry, tired, and now agitated. He was screaming in pain and panic. He was crying that he never should have come to the ER and that he just should have stayed home. His phrases started to become suicidal at times, and I had to calm him down. 

The doctor came in and told him to stop screaming because there were other patients there. My jaw dropped at this. I said over and over and OVER that he was having a panic attack. The doctor said, “Yeah, I would say he has a *lot* of anxiety…” in a rude tone. I asked if there was anything to do for him, such as splashing water on his face or something, and he just shrugged like it didn’t affect him at all. He sneeringly said to him, at least two separate times, “Well, you’re not vomiting anymore, are you?”/”Well…at least you’re not vomiting”. 

Then, the situation got worse. Kevin was screaming again and the doctor came in and asked him “Are you ready to leave now?” This and all of the treatment prior to him saying that felt intentional, but at the very least, this was ***negligent*** on his part. He asked my boyfriend to leave because of his screaming. My boyfriend was in pain and was not being assisted whatsoever. He told my boyfriend that he was screaming “like a toddler” and that it “must not be impressive to your girlfriend”. He also accused my boyfriend of yelling at the nurse, which again, was **not** true. There was more cussing, from BOTH ends. It escalated so fast that I could not believe it was happening. Kevin tells them he wants to leave and to take the IV out. The nurse comes in and tosses his Visit Summary onto the bed. The nurse takes the IV out, and as she is, Kevin says that the doctor was “being an asshole to \[him\]”. The nurse said “Do not talk about my staff that way” and told him that he was being difficult. He said that he was having a reaction and no one was being helpful. She said to him, “Well, *you* need to stop smoking.” He then said she was being an asshole, and she laughed and walked out. She did not properly wrap the bandage on his arm because when he went to put on his shirt it instantly fell to the ground. There was blood dripping down his arm onto the floor and I pointed it out to him. This startled us both. He anxiously screamed for her to come back and redo it. There was still arguing between the doctor and Kevin, and I apologized to the staff saying that he was not usually like this and that this has been a long day. I had begun to say that he was tired from not sleeping and hungry from throwing up all day. The nurse interrupted me and said, “That is no excuse”. Amongst the chaos, she fixed his bandage and he was escorted out by security. Security was also taunting him, threatening to drag him out and also calling him names. I again thanked the staff. Although they were rude and apathetic to Kevin, I understand the enormous burnout that can come with the job and I appreciate healthcare workers immensely. I know multiple nurses among family and friends, some even from this hospital. I have heard many of their work stories and will never forget what medical workers do for us. I have been going to this hospital since birth and have never questioned my choice to hopefully stay with them for life. However, this experience has damaged my faith in this hospital. 

What also struck me as concerning was the doctor constantly looking at me to help him. My boyfriend was subjected to discriminatory treatment by Dr. Smith. During the consultation, my boyfriend expressed concerns about his symptoms, but the doctor dismissed his concerns and often looked to me to either confirm or deny his claims. He would give me sarcastic looks as if my boyfriend could not see them. This behavior was not only racially insensitive but also displayed a severe lack of racial, social, and cultural competence on the part of the doctor. My boyfriend's concerns were valid and deserved to be taken seriously, regardless of his race or ethnicity. No amount of training will change the dangerous underlying biases that Dr. Smith displayed that night. 

My boyfriend and I were regretful to have brought him there that night. He regretted signing up for this hospital, rather than another in the area. This was a stressful and emotionally tolling experience for both Kevin and myself. I believe that Kevin deserved compassionate and SAFE care. We later learned that his family has a history of bad reactions to Zofran. He was gaslit, mocked, and discriminated against during his stay. He did not feel safe and was consistently being egged on by the staff. The ignorance of mental health within the emergency room was clear that night, and I will *never* recommend someone to visit this emergency room. 

Kevin continued to experience pain until the following afternoon. We were thankfully helped by the kind nurses and doctor in Urgent Care.

My aunt passed away and left me part of her ownership of a building she rented out with her brother (my uncle), to be paid out in monthly payments. This past November, my uncle sent 2 checks to my friend in Cleveland, one for $1000, the other for $4050. My friend deposited them to my checking account on my behalf, writing ""For Deposit Only"" on the back. Shortly after the checks were deposited, a week-long hold was placed on both of them, which I thought was to be expected given that previously we had been using Zelle to make my monthly payments.

But then after a week, the bank refused to lift the hold on the checks, claiming they were ""Still trying to determine the source of funds"". My uncle also sends these checks to my sister each month, and she has been depositing them with no problem at her bank, so not sure why they had trouble with my checks.

I kept using the bank's online chat service to ask for updates, but the hold remained on the checks for 3 months, saying they were still ""investigating"". Finally, last month, they informed me they were closing my account for suspected fraud and that I couldn't dispute their decision. The sent a letter to my friend just last weekend announcing that the account had been closed, and the letter said ""If there was a positive balance in the account, a check will be included with this letter."" The letter included my final statement which showed I had $5050.01 in my account, but there was no check included. I got on the bank's chat program again and asked them about the status of the check, and they said they were still investigating the funds and there was no ETA on when (or even if) they would send the check.

It's already been 6 months since my friend deposited those checks. I think that's more than enough time to ""investigate the funds"". To me, it sounds like the bank just intends to keep the money and never return it to me. Do I have any legal options to get this bank to stop stringing me along and return my money to me? I'm sick of this and just want it to be over so all involved can move on.

**EDIT 1:** Here's the redacted letter my friend received. Again, no check was included with the letter, even though they also sent me a statement showing $5050.01 in my account:

**EDIT 2 :** It seems like my next step is to contact the CFPB and the OCC. Hopefully this lights a fire under the bank and they just decide it's not worth the trouble dragging this out any longer. I mean, they already won. They closed my account and got rid of me as a customer. All I want is my money back and I'll be on my merry way. 

Thanks for all the advice!"
465,465,New York land encroachment,"A neighbor is encroaching on our land with a small garden. I've got a surveyor coming so I can build a fence but theyre booked out 3 months.

466,466,Merchant is filing demand for arbitration after I (consumer) win bank chargeback disputes,"Long story short, I participated in sports cards breaks on a selling platform not fully understanding how they work. These sellers on their platform are extremely persuasive and manipulative. They will get others to bid up prices on auctions and whine when they do not sell for egregious prices.

Before the sellers shipped the items that I “won” I requested a refund, do not send any items and mentioned that I would not accept any items, refuse and return them unopened.

I got no help from the sellers or the merchants support, and all they said it no returns or refunds. So I started the chargeback process with my credit card with the reason item not as described.

About 3 weeks later once I refused and returned all packages shipped to me, the tracking informed me sellers got their items and still will not refund.

Their support now sends legal team to tell me to reverse all chargebacks and pay them $xx even though chargeback amount is closer to half that amount.

The bank sides with me after I sent in all evidence to defend my case. And now the merchant filed for demand for arbitration with the  AAA.

I am not sure how to handle this besides retaining a lawyer to help defend my stance. But he is expensive. Is there anyone else that has gone through this process?"
467,467,Anybody know renters rights in Oklahoma?,"I have a dilemma.  I have been living in my apt going on 3 years now.  Recently the original owner sold multiple apt s to this new company from California. On March 1st or 2nd they posted a notice on our door stating that we have 60 days to vacate the apt.  I am not behind on rent, nor utilities.  They did give me the option to have them select another apt for us to move into, with the cost of moving being on them since they initiated this whole ordeal. We took them up on the offer as far as we knew they were finding us another apt. They're basically forcing tenants out with the option to sign a new lease. They will also increase rent with the new lease. Now, originally they said they were going to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom instead of a 1 bedroom for what I'm paying now plus an additional $75. Then, a week later, they called and stated that WE (not them) were mistaken and they wanted to charge us significantly more for the upgrade.  We opted for another single bedroom apt. My mother stays with me, we are both disabled and on fixed income. They know this. Last week, the woman running the show said we aren't supposed to be out until June 1st, which contradicts the notice we have which states may 1st.  She also stated that people are moving out of an apt, which they will paint and then we can move, said to start packing. Now we have tried to get in touch with this person multiple times, in person and over the phone. She's never called us back nor is she ever in the office and nobody else knows what all is going on. Although, somebody has been out to speak with my upstairs neighbors twice about the same thing, yet they've haven't stopped by ours. It's a shit show. I should've spoken with an attorney  as soon as it happened and got it in writing. I'm going to, but I'm looking for somebody to weigh in on this in the meantime."
468,468,Stock options rescinded,"A friend of mine was hired at a tech startup about 18 months ago as a Director of Sales. They gave him $400k on target earnings + significant shares.

There is nothing in his employment agreement that speaks to whether the org is allowed to do this or not. Any idea whether this is legal?"

I live in an apartment complex, and my downstairs neighbors have been keeping their husky on their very small porch, never letting the dog inside. I used to hear him move a metal bowl around or scratch at their glass door late at night but they've started putting him in a crate at night (still outside). They live on the ground floor so I've started kinda doing wellness checks on him to see if he's okay. He rarely has water (he might knock the bowl over), never food (though I've seen him eating some like jerky treats), the porch smells like pee and usually has poo on it and he's starting to look skinny. I live in Georgia where the temps hit the 100sF and I dont think any dog can survive that, let alone a husky, so im trying to do what I can before summer hits.

I could report it to my building but I have a cat that the management doesn't know about and I know I shouldn't throw stones, also if I tell them I can't help where the dog goes. I dont know if animal control would even help in this situation since it would be a first time report?

Please what are my legal options? I willing to commit crimes for this sweet boy but I wanna know what I can legally do first."
470,470,Should I be worried that on 2n page of notary has some blank space and my and notary sign/stamp on 3rd page (last page),"**Tacoma WA.**

**I sent a signed and notarized settlement agreement (insurance settlement) with some blank space on 2nd page and 3rd (last) page has plaintiff (my) signature notarized and notary stamp /certificate and signature? should I be worried about that blank space? there is no sign/seal of insurance company's rep. on the document.**

They sent me an agreement like that and I took it to notary - **even notary was not sure ..he said why is it blank space on page 2?** I said am not sure but than he himself said oh on each page agreement 1 agreement 2 and agreement 3 is written at the bottom corner so it should be ok.

So yes it has 3 pages but what about the space in 2nd page - can that me misused for example insurance company can put new terms and conditions in that blank space and claim that I signed like that? Also 3rd page is nothing but signature ...standalone signature page ..can that be misused ? Please note I have the original pages ..sent copies only to insurance company."
471,471,Florida Employer Indemnity Clause- too vague to be considered enforceable?,"I am an independent contractor working remotely for a real estate related business based in Florida. My employer wants me to sign a contract with an indemnity clause but I am hesitant to sign because the clause is so vague and appears to leave me with no recourse if my employer breaches the contract.

I texted and emailed my mom that on April 22nd, my friend will pick it up for me at the door but she didn’t respond or read anything(she has her read receipts on and she hasn’t opened any of my messages since late march of this year). I texted her sister, the homeowner, that my friend will come pick it up at the door and she said she doesn’t want them coming to pick up my stuff. I told them they can just leave it at the porch and I can grab it myself but I don’t want to talk to see any of them.

It’s unprovoked( or was until times I tried to confront this person ). I’ve taken multiple clear videos of the sound and it’s very loud not mistakable for anything other than multiple hard stomps or bangs, complained to the leasing office, called the Police a few times(who’ve told me repeatedly there’s nothing they could do which I find silly too lol.) andIve even got a video of her saying she’s going to keep stomping lmao.

What I thought would be relief for my daughter and I was just continued abuse through the homeowner. Lots of violations regarding unannounced visits (several documented) wrongful eviction attempts, months w/out a working refrigerator and ultimately threatened with unlawful detainer if not gone within 90 days due to his intent to sell the home. I assumed he would sell to the ex but blatantly turned around and rented (cheaper) and to be sure that I'm aware had the protection order amended. Every attorney I've contacted has pushed me towards small claims or states that I need a different lawyer. I've reached out to personal injury and landlord tenant. My daughter and I have dealt with a lot over the past year and its way beyond small claims.

479,479,Do I have a case?,"In late March I was driving home from work at 3:40am and hit a deer. I called the cops then went to my State Farm app to file a claim. I saw my app looked different than usual and decided I’d call them after I slept. Well that afternoon I called their Customer Service Number and asked them why my app looked different and they stated I hadn’t paid for the month. I made sure to ask multiple times in various wording to ensure that if I paid that I would be covered. Every time I had asked she told me yes. It went something like this:

Me: “So if I pay for now for this month, I would have coverage from the beginning of March to the end of March” 

Representative: “Yes, once you pay there won’t be any interruption in your coverage for the entire month of March”  

So I paid then asked “So if I need to file a claim for something that happened a week it won’t get rejected because I’m covered” 

She said there shouldn’t be any issues if I were to file claim for anything that happened in March. 

So I filed a claim and it was rejected because I wasn’t covered. I called the claims office and they told me a few things: my policy doesn’t exist and that I need to contact my agent. I contacted my agent and they said they’d investigate. The next day the agent called and told me they had a meeting that morning to ensure this misinformation wasn’t spread and that they weren’t going to do anything to help me. I asked them “so you basically lied to me and aren’t going to help me?” They said basically yea, sorry about that. 

I need to know if I have a chance if I wanted to sue, because what the fuck."
480,480,Using well-known photos in my blog posts,"Hello everyone!

I'm preparing to launch a new website about photography, where I will discuss different photography techniques as well as the works of famous photographers. 

My question is, will I be able to use well-known photos from famous photographers in my articles? I've read somewhere that something like this is allowed if an article serves as a critique of a specific photo. Is that true? 

And also, could I use a photo if an article isn't specifically about it, but is closely related to the message a photo tries to convey?

Example: I want to talk about using lines in photography, and I'd like to include [Rhein II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhein_II) in the article as an example.

I'd really appreciate it if somebody could clarify this whole copyright situation for me.

Thanks!

I could not control my emotions or my actions and I started calling her parents and her friends in search of answers as to if she has cheated in the past as well.

488,488,Friends want a % of my business,"This is in Oregon.

Three years ago I started a small, homeschool nature group. Out of my own pocket- as a resource for the community.
Last year I earned a $10,000 micro grant from an alternative education fund to grow my group.

I fulfill the grant and grow my business reach successfully. I then apply for the Next Step grant through the same company.

My two friends came to sit with me while I brainstormed to write up the grant. Friend A suggested that I create an adventure website. I liked the idea, and I said “sounds great! We can go in on it as equal partners!” Or something along those lines.

I wrote up the grant and earned the $50,000 next step grant! My friends now want a 1/3 share of my business. I feel that although I made some verbal promises, nothing was in writing. I also do not know much about business. Now that I realize everything that goes into business including taxes and liability.

Throughout all these negotiations my friends have been rather nasty. I no longer want to honor when the 40/30/30 split I had offered. When I look at it- my work created this opportunity.

They view my grant as “free” money and our money. Some of this is my fault- I didn’t think how making them equal partners would mean a loss for me since they are bringing no money to the table- just offering to do work like write unit studies, design for my content, and scout trails.

They hired a lawyer and want to meet to create a contract. What is fair in this situation?

I own the LLC- I am the sole proprietor. I met them through the group I created (they were customers). I am not sure how to navigate this in a way that I don’t lose control over what I created. I also do want to be fair to my friends.

I offered 40/30/30 on the website (but I assume tax liabilities). They didn’t like this because they aren’t on the LLC. I now feel like this offer over text was too generous and maybe these friends are not the friends I thought they were.

Can I legally backtrack? What is typical or fair share in a situation like this?"

Today I got a speeding ticket late at night on a highway in Los Angeles. Post speed limit is 65 and speed of traffic was around 80 as usual. I was clocked a little over 90. The cop wrote the ticket for 80. I’m wondering if I should just ask for traffic school and call it a day or  should I attempt to please not guilty first. If I plead not guilty and the cop does show up, can he adjust the ticket to the clocked rate? Do they even have records of speedometer/ dash cam?

496,496,I found mold in my apartment. Can I be compensated?,"So a few weeks ago I discovered a large portion of my bedroom carpet was covered in mold. All my things that were stored under the bed were damp or covered in spores. It was disgusting. After putting in a maintenance request, we found out our shower was leaking water through the wall and into my bedroom. The shower hadn’t been properly sealed before we moved in. I had to move out all my stuff, and my roommate and I slept in the living room for several days while they tore up the carpets and the wall to air out the mold. Mind you, this was during finals week, so I was very stressed trying to study for exams. They sealed the shower and we didn’t have to pay for any repairs. But I had to throw out a lot of my belongings, including a suitcase, bath towels, some clothes, 2 brittas, an electric toothbrush, and bedsheets. First, I’m wondering if we can have next month’s rent partially reduced because we were technically displaced from our room during that time. Second, I would like for the landlord to pay for all the stuff that got covered in mold. I didn’t take pictures of everything because my first instinct was to throw it away because of the smell. Do I contact the landlord directly?

edit: I live in California btw"
497,497,Probate?,"I just need to know what to do. We live in Kansas.

My husband's best friend in recent months had tremors and was not well..

A medical facility had him taking an experimental drug for tremors in a blind study. He had been in the study for about two months.

Yesterday he called and asked for a ride to the Emergency Room as he was having trouble breathing. We got there about 2:00 p.m. He was released and sent home about 12:30 a.m. this morning.

He was not answering his phone or the doorbell, so my husband went over, as he has the alarm code and could get in. My husband found him passed away in the bathroom and called 911. The EMT said he had been dead several hours. The police and medical examiner just left, and they plan to do an autopy because of the study. We contacted his brother and together we chose a funeral home.

Months ago, he told us he had a will and my husband is named executor. I think we need to do something legal with the will. 

Does anyone know what steps we need to take from here? Please? Thanks."

0,0,"Seller didn't disclose termites, Inspector negligently missed them... do we have any recourse? [NJ]","We are new homeowners, and dealing with a nightmare lemon-house (purchased from out of state)... please help me figure out if we have any recourse with this particular issue. If not, this may financially ruin us.

* Seller indicated ""no"" on disclosure form to history of termites, and ""no"" to a history of contracts with pest control companies for termites. We hired an inspector (who offered an add-on termite inspection), and he didn't note anything wrong with the property. There is an active infestation in the foundation and  throughout the house. 3 separate opinions noted any competent inspector should have seen the issues. (I didn't know what to look for during final walkthrough, never grew up where termites were widespread).
* I called a few local termite treatment companies. One of the big companies said that they have an account at our address, under the seller's name. There are also a few knocked-down mud tubes on the property. We were told this is a standard procedure after treatment (so you can tell if they return). It looks like the Seller failed to disclose termites (or at least, having had a contract with the company, which was on the disclosure form).

Could the seller liable for some of the repairs we will need? (it is extensive unfortunately). Our contract did say something about advising buyers hire a professional exterminator to inspect for termites prior to closing (we unfortunately trusted our inspector as competent). Does that advise disqualify the seller from liability?  


We are in NJ"

2,2,NEED HELP!! Contractor refuses to continue work and has taken materials ordered for our project,"We hired a contractor to build a gable patio for us in the backyard. The contractor had originally quoted us 4 weeks to finish this project. We have a contract, which outlines a payment schedule by time. Such as week 1 an X amount will be paid, Week 2 X amount will be paid (I know this was our mistake, we should have done by the work done instead) . The first week things were slow, demolition took way longer then it should have. The contractor assured us that thing will pick up. Second was the same as well, yet we adhered to the payment schedule.  By the end of week 3, ~ 70% of the work was done. But the rest still remained. But there was no change as week 4 concluded, and he asked for money so we told him we won't be releasing any money as there no progress from the previous week. After a long and heated discussion we ended up give him the check. At this point,  we have given 92% of the amount agreeed upon by bother parties and the last 8% was to be delieved upon finishing the project. The week later he came back and asked for more money. We refused as its not in the contract we signed. And he came back with change orders, (changes that we supposedly made to the scope of work). Most of the items were already in the scope of work disscussed and signed by him and I. So we refused them as well. He then took the marterial for our project  and refuses to give it back. The dudes an 80 year old man, who is kinda racist ( we are immigrants).  I just want to know what I can do. He refuses to meet, our original idea was to have him sign an agreement where we release the remaining 8% of the money in parts after certain things of the project are completed. To the best of our knowledge, we have not breached the contract. Would love some help in this manner. He keeps threatening liens on us if we don't pay. We live in Texas btw."

After the deed was done they then demanded 60,000 philippino pesos, saying their friend was a hooker. Of course I only had 3000, so they walked me to an ATM, where 4 of their friends joined and made sure I didn't try anything.
They even threatened to call the police on ME.

4,4,"160k in debt, no promised license yet, can I sue?","I graduated last year from a nonprofit private university with $160,000 of private loan debt for a music teaching degree. Please don't comment on the poor reasoning here- it's beside the point and I’ve learned my lesson. This degree promised to equip me with all the requirements to obtain a teaching license. After graduating, the school reached out with the following:

""Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that the instructor who taught you the required reading standards did not meet the new faculty qualifications under a recent state rule that was passed. Because of this, we now need you to complete an additional course with a qualified reading instructor before we can submit your license materials to the proper licensure association."" They covered the course for me. 

I completed the class and still haven't gotten my license yet this year as the teacher still hasn't put in final grades for the course (and the course was a total joke, it took me roughly two hours to complete (all online) and the professor took 2+ months respond to any request). Obviously, I was declined from all teaching jobs I applied to during this time while I didn't have a license. I've taken a job in a childcare, just trying to make ends meet right now. This put my career on hold for a whole year, and I can’t get my deposit back from the licensing organization when I went to try and apply the first time back in July. Can I press charges against my university? Any other advice for what to do is appreciated."
5,5,Excessive Force?,I was arrested at my residence for traffic ticket warrants and while being escorted out of my home in handcufs my dog lunged at the officer thinking I was in danger. My dog did not bite the officer but came very close to he then told me “you better get your dog before I shoot it” I then replied “your not gonna shoot my dog your in her yard”. I then yelled at my dog to get away wich she did the officer then jerked me to continue walking toward the end of the driveway. He then jerked me again at which point I told him “chill out” and before I new it he legged swept me from the front causing me to land straight on my head. Being that i was handcuffed i could not brace my fall and ended up being knocked unconscious from the fall. My question is  Can i sue the police officer for excessive force or would his actions be justified under law? my security cameras captured the whole encounter.

A work order was submitted to the property and after I followed up they said the plumber was working on it. Fast forward to today, April 2023. I still do not have hot water. The property is well aware of the hot water issues and there are tons of other tenants who have left reviews on their website complaining, even the news interviewed a previous tenant regarding the hot water issues. I am at a point where I need to get out of this lease, I cannot take it anymore. They closed my last work order (cancelled it ) regarding the hot water without following up with me to see if I had hot water. No plumber has been by my apartment since January to check. I have the option to “buy out” of my lease…but given the fact they aren’t holding up their end of the contract, I would like to end the contract without legal repercussions or paying the buy out fees. Is this something I legally have a right to do at this point? I am located in Oklahoma, which of course has almost 0 laws to protect tenants. But, hot water is a basic necessity so I need to know if I have a standing chance to get out of my lease legally."

He has already been held in contempt twice over other matters, and there are additional contempt motions pending.  He is not at all dissuaded by contempt motions. He is self-employed, so I can’t garnish his wages. He was also court-ordered to cover our expensive health insurance premium, and he stopped paying that as well.

11,11,How to keep the fact that I was the victim in a child sexual abuse case private when I have to include it on my bar application?,"The state is MA, if that helps.

The C&F question is ""*Have you ever been a party, other than as representing counsel, in any other legal or administrative proceedings?*""

I was a victim-witness in a child sexual abuse case and I also sued my abuser after the criminal case concluded.

I don't want this to become public record. I don't want the entire board of bar examiners knowing this sensitive information about me if it's avoidable. And I certainly I don't wish for the bar examiners to contact me or anyone in my family to ask questions about it.

It has zero bearing on my ability to practice law. It seems crazy that I have to include legal actions in which I was not the party who caused the harm.

I was *three years old* when the harm began (or at least when it was first independently verifiable--most likely began earlier than that.) It seems crazy that anything that happened that long ago should have to be included on my bar application. What's next? Do I have to include my kindergarten disciplinary record?

Is there anything I can do to keep this private, totally irrelevant information private?

And how many documents do they expect me to dig up for this? Finding documents (perhaps having to request documents from a court in another state) from the cases is going to cause more emotional distress than I want to be dealing with during exam. Is there any way to avoid this? I hate this."
12,12,TX - Update on gamestop giving my PS5 to a thief.,"I called the corporate line like most of you suggested. Thanks for that. Also F you for that. Holy hell that line was the WORST customer service I have ever dealt with. Including comcast. 

Anyways. After being transferred from India to China to Taiwan and then to Malaysia. Or just 3 different departments whom had no clue what the hell was going on. Seriously… Warm transfers anyone? I finally got on the phone with someone who mattered. I had to send the video from my phone to them, but they finally agreed that the store screwed up. They gave me a replacement right away.  They asked if the same store was a good place to pick up the unit, I said yes and they gave me some instructions for the supervisor there. 

Get to the store and new employees are there. Manager I talked with had been hired yesterday so apparently this was bad enough for the previous people to be gone. Either that or they just hired a new manager. He had to make 3 phone calls to get the transaction processed. Its like they hired a kid off the street and didn’t train them. Either way doesn’t matter to me. Ill never be back to gamestop ever.  

I get the unit home and noticed it was the disk version. At that point I no longer cared that it was an upgrade. I was done and never wanted to go through this process again. I just spent the day transferring his ps4 games to his ps5. 

Side note. The guy who stole the ps5 got caught. The manager realized the situation halfway through and told me they caught the guy. Said he did it to several gamestops and got caught in the act at one of them."
13,13,Employer not allowing me to park in the patient lot handicapped parking. Forcing me to park in a far away employee lot on other side of hospital.,"I am a young, healthy looking employee with a handicap placard. I have an artificial hip and a metal rod holding my femur together- but I don't walk with a limp. However walking long distances often results in  me being unable to fall asleep as pain seems to creep up on me in the evening.

My employer (a hospital) is requiring all employees to park in a certain lot, which happens to be on the other side of the hospital from my office. 

I started parking in a patient lot as there are numerous handicapped parking spots there, and they are never fully filled. A parking attendant saw me park, recognized me and chastised me for parking in a handicapped spot. After I told her I had a placard, she still told me I am not allow to be in this lot.

I don't know if I should press the issue, any insights or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe Im the asshole."
14,14,I requested an exterminator for a mouse outbreak. Eleven days later and no exterminator has come and my landlord has sent notice that my apartment has unsanitary living conditions.,"I am a current student at university and have lived in my apartment complex in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the past year and a half. Last week, I was doing work in my living space when a mouse crawled under my door and run into my kitchen. I put in a maintenance request that day requesting an exterminator. I am deeply afraid of mice and have been avoiding my kitchen at all cost because that is where the mouse tends to live. 

A maintenance man showed up the next day asking where the dead mouse was and I stated that I needed someone to remove the mouse living in my kitchen. He looked around and told me that the exterminator only comes to the building one day a week and that he had just come the day prior so I had to wait a week for the exterminator. 

In the mean time, I purchased a few hundred dollars worth of mice removal equipment and pet control items for my apartment. I waited a week for the exterminator to come on the day that the maintenance man said the exterminator would come but they no showed. Due to my university schedule, I was home until 3:00pm when I left my only class of the day (which started at 3:30) began.

The next day, I called my apartment complex  when I saw the mouse again and explained that the mouse was still there. I explained that the exterminator never showed like was promised and they said they would send someone my way. 

I was breaking down large boxes when a maintenance man showed up at my door. I had left my boxes next to my sofa and the trash bags, full of items the mouse got into the night prior that I had just finished cleaning up, along the wall next to the boxes.  The maintenance man asked where the dead mouse was again and I told him that the mouse was still alive hiding in my kitchen. He asked to come in and I let him in again. He looked at my boxes and said that those were good hiding spots for mice to hide in and I told him that I was just breaking them down when he arrived. 

He then entered the kitchen (which I have refused to enter for the past week) to see if there were any holes in the walls that the mouse was using as a hiding spot. I explained to him that the mouse had crawled threw my front door to enter my apartment so he left to get something to prevent the mouse from entering my apartment that way in the future. He told me he would only be gone a couple of minutes but ended up being gone for 40 minutes. By the time he has come back, I needed to get to class so I left him in my apartment to do whatever he needed to do.

Later in the day, I get an email stating that due to ""undisposed garbage, boxes along the floor, and moldy food left in the kitchen sink and oven"" I was going to be expecting a surprise visit from my landlord to inspect the property. I went into my kitchen and did see dishes in my sink I needed to wash but there was no mold on any plates nor was there any food or mold in my oven.

I have since cleaned up the boxes and trash bags but what can I do to get them to send an exterminator? Could this be something they can evict me for?"
15,15,My mentally impaired cousin is being abused by her husband.,"i’m not sure what my cousin has, but she is deaf.. hardly speaks and mentally she’s 5. she had a planned married back in 2011, and had her daughter in 2016. my cousin was under my aunt’s care up until 2017, when she moved out with her husband and kid. since then, the 3 of them live in a very cluttered and filthy room that they rent out. 

i recently saw their daughter for the first time since she was a kid.. she just turned 9 yesterday. she tells me that her dad hits her mom, and how he always comes home drunk. she tells me she has to pretend to love her dad or else “bad things will happen”. she tells me she remembers bad things from her childhood.. and when i ask her what memories she has, she says she doesn’t remember. she tells me her family fat shames her. she tells me she can’t communicate with her parents. 

to put it in perspective, her father is an alcoholic that came from vietnam so he doesn’t speak any english. her mom, is mentally not there so she can’t communicate. her father also takes her mom’s disability checks for himself.

she’s told me that her mom tried to commit suicide from the abuse from her dad. i’ve grown up with her mom and it doesn’t sit right with me that my cousin would ever have the mental capacity to try to harm herself like that. idk. she’s using so many curse words at such a young age and tells me “my parents don’t understand what im saying so..” and then tells me that she had to go to summer school but since her parents don’t know english she didn’t go.

17,17,Friend created a website telling people not to use a business; owner threatening to sue,"A couple of years ago my friend hired a cleaning company to clean his house.  They charged him for 17 hours of work and stuck him with almost a $2000 bill.  My friend was appalled at the condition of the house and couldn’t believe how bad of a job they did.  He had primarily hired them to clean up the dog hair from a previous owner and there was still dog hair everywhere.  My friend took pictures of huge clumps of dog hair to document this.

My friend demanded a refund because he could not understand what the 17 hours was spent doing when the house did not look like it had been cleaned at all.  Several Google reviews online from other dissatisfied customers backed up this claim and shared similar stories about astronomically high bills with little results.

My friend created a website called “donothire(business name here)” and documented his experience with them with pictures, urging people not to use their services.  Over the year the comments section received several people commending him for calling attention to this business, once again citing similar stories.

The owner is now threatening to sue and - at the very least - threatening a restraining order.  Before this threat my friend took the site down.

I’m curious: how boned is he?"
18,18,"Friends horse was stolen, officer said they can't get her back","So, my friend has a horse who they've had for over 10 years. She's had a bad injury that prevented them from riding her. They kept her as healthy/comfortable as humanely possible and even had a surgery done years ago to minimize any pain the horse might be feeling.

A month ago they noticed the horse was in way too much pain and felt it was ethical to euthanize her. It was an extremely painful decision, this horse has been a huge part of their life. 

Right before the veterinarian came, a woman stole the horse from the property they were keeping her and contacted them saying the horse was fine. This woman claims the horse is completely healthy and wouldn't acknowledge the pain she is in. She basically told them that *she* will let them know when *she* feels like it's time to euthanize and let them know so they can say goodbye.

My friends contacted the authorities of course, but they said since the horse is on private property, they can't do anything about it. That can't be right! I don't know exactly what kind of documentation of ownership they have, but I know there's years of veterinary records with the horses photo attached, shipping records, etc. 

They think the horse might've been harmed further by being moved to a new property. I think my friend feels dumb trying to lawyer up to get a horse back just to put her down, but this has been painful enough before she was stolen. They wanted to make a humane choice and had veterinarian consent to do so. It's like their choice to say goodbye has been taken from them and it's horrible. 

Is there anything that can be done for this situation?

Edit - thank you everyone for the kind and helpful answers ❤️ I'm crying, it's not even my horse but it's sucked watching my friend go through this and feel like there's nothing they can do about it."
19,19,Neighbor keeps harassing us and now put these out.,"Hi!

I recently relocated to Rochester Minnesota in December for my wifes job. We bought our home and we love everything except our neighbors.

Ever since we have moved in they have constantly harassed us about their fence citing that we were ""piling up snow"" on it. Regardless of the fact that I told them that snow comes from the sky, not from our garage and reminded them about the middle school concept of snow drift/erosion. They have on one occasion even dumped all the snow that was between our fence and driveway onto my driveway and then left. Anytime we do something they have any semblance of an issue with they scream, cuss and as a result of their geriatric mouths with barely any teeth, spit on us in the process. I had planned to just keep ignoring it even though I know they keep coming onto our property to stare at their beloved fence that is approximately a foot away from our driveway/garage, but that's creepy.

Now here was the last straw for me. They posted these stupid signs at two points facing our driveway and at this point I feel like it's almost proof of them harassing me and definitely proof that they keep walking onto my property without permission, and I've flnally just reached my breaking point. Does anyone have any idea what I could do? I called our non emergency line and the cops basically said that the only thing we can do is get a restraining order or trespass them from our property. They also have decorated the front fence with one of those ""protected by the 2nd ammendment"" stickers that faces me every time I enter my driveway. I'm at a loss and was wondering if I could get any advice.

Lastly, yes the fence is behind their property lines, so I can't cite them for that.

Since I can't post an image, the sign is massive, red and reads 

""Absolutely no snow! No trespassing, no garbage, no yard debris, animals, mice or snakes. 

Any damage to property/fence is on you""

Thanks for your time."
20,20,Can my ex hide all our assets under an LLP so I don’t get half in our divorce?,"I am going through a divorce with my ex, we have two children, a mortgage, two car loans, and a good amount of stuff. As of this writing I have filled divorce but we’re still officially married. We’re in Texas.


Last fall, while we were married, he formed three companies: a LLP which owns a for-profit LLC which owns a non-profit LLC. According to the business structure, he and I each have a 1% stake in the LLP, and each of the LLCs own 49% stake in the LLP. My ex owns 100% of the for-profit LLC, which owns 100% of the non-profit LLC. There was no official legal counsel consulted for the formation of these companies; he got a Partnership Agreement template for the LLC from a LegalZoom equivalent. I do have a copy of that I can consult if questions arise.


He basically is trying to turn our “estate” into a business. He says the LLP owns our house and all our assets and liabilities. *He* and *I* don’t actually own anything, it’s all considered a depreciable asset of the LLP. According to his 2022 Annual Report, each of the 3 companies are considered a “Real Estate Investment Trust” and none of them have any tax due. He hasn’t done any business with the for-profit or non-profit LLCs, no clients, $0 in the business bank accounts.


If you check the public records for our home, only his and my names are on the deed of our house, not any of the companies.


He did a complete estate asset valuation table that included almost every item in our home that we own. I’ll mention, last spring we sold our first house and got a pretty hefty cash profit, about $80k of which went into a down payment and upgrades on our current house. The remaining $80k he pretty much unilaterally spent on STUFF. I wanted to invest, I tried to save, but he spent it, and more, putting us further in credit card debt. Our couples therapist heavily suspected Narcissistic Personality Disorder, that coupled with lots of other stuff led to me filing for divorce.


It was my understanding that in the divorce, I am entitled to half our community property, or realistically half the fair market value of our community property. Especially since he spent all our cash, we can’t afford our mortgage, car payments, and preschool tuition without his mom’s help, so all we really have is *stuff*.


I wrote up a proposal because we’re trying to settle out of court. I do have legal representation (I’m going to confer with him about this of course, but I want to be armed with all the info I can), but my ex is representing himself. We agree on custody entirely (50/50), and he didn’t seem to have an issue with the standard child support calculator. We mutually want a good-faith, inexpensive, efficient, out-of-court settlement.


Upon reading my proposal, he said I have NO claim to half the value of our assets because they’re owned by the LLP. I don’t think he has an issue physically giving me some stuff, but he doesn’t think he owes me half the fair market value of the community property he’s keeping. Is that legit? Everything I’ve read about hiding assets from divorce in LLCs is referencing LLCs formed PRIOR to marriage, where the assets wouldn’t be community property. He says I’m entitled to half the equity of our LLP, which is all our assets minus all our liabilities, which conveniently equals zero according to his valuations. 


I’m well over my head here, and trying not to be the victim of his mental/emotional/financial abuse anymore. If anyone has read this far and has input, I am so grateful."

What can i do?","I have an order of joint custody (im non-custodial) and a standard visitation order following oklahoma law.

Whenever asked to be more encouraging instead of simply saying ""you dont have to go if you dont want to"" she just replies that shes not forcing her autistic son to do something he doesnt want to. This also isnt the first time this has happened. After looking at it further she hasnt followed a single one of the courts orders, she always makes plans on my weekends with him and in the 4 years since the court order hes stayed the night a total of 4 times. I had to have myself added to his medical records by contacting the hospital and giving them the court order, and had to do the same for his old school. I dont even know what school he is in now and i certainly havnt been added to his contact list.

So are there any options or steps i can take before finding a lawyer and making it a full blown court battle? Ive tried contacting DHS already but they told me they dont handle that kind of issue."
22,22,Billed for No Services Rendered,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, not sure exactly where it belongs.  This is in PA.

In 2018 my husband and I purchased a LG washer and drier.  The salesman convinced us to purchase a warranty which we later realized was money wasted.  The warranty was from Consumer Protection Services (CPS).

In January the washer dies and we are in dire straights because we have a newborn and are using it for multiple loads daily.  We submit a claim using the CPS website.  The claim is accepted and a company called LG Electronics Alabama, Inc is assigned the repair with a date scheduled.  In the meantime we are frantically searching for a place that can repair it sooner. 

We find another repair place and the washer gets fixed.  LG Electronics Alabama, Inc gets in contact with my husband for the appointment and he cancels it (he has all the texts saved).  I checked the CPS website and couldn't find a way to officially cancel the claim online so I just left it open.  Probably should have called to talk to someone but had other newborn stuff to do.

Fast forward to yesterday and we receive a bill in the mail for $268 for ""Service call not covered under warranty”.  Bill dated 4-11.  Of course we call and can't get through so I send an email to the address listed on the bill explaining the situation and asking for proof of services rendered.

If the appointment was cancelled and no services were provided I can't just be billed, right?  I am hoping this is just a mistake, but if CPS pushes back, what are my best options?  I don't want to go through the hassle of getting a fighting a ding on my credit for not paying a fabricated bill."
23,23,"Bank closed my account for (allegedly) suspected fraud, and now refuses to return my funds that were in my account","I am an American living abroad, and I had a checking account in my former home state of Ohio. I had been with this bank for more than 2 decades and have been using various services (Paypal, Wise, etc) to move money between that bank and where I am living abroad.

My aunt passed away and left me part of her ownership of a building she rented out with her brother (my uncle), to be paid out in monthly payments. This past November, my uncle sent 2 checks to my friend in Cleveland, one for $1000, the other for $4050. My friend deposited them to my checking account on my behalf, writing ""For Deposit Only"" on the back. Shortly after the checks were deposited, a week-long hold was placed on both of them, which I thought was to be expected given that previously we had been using Zelle to make my monthly payments.

But then after a week, the bank refused to lift the hold on the checks, claiming they were ""Still trying to determine the source of funds"". My uncle also sends these checks to my sister each month, and she has been depositing them with no problem at her bank, so not sure why they had trouble with my checks.

I kept using the bank's online chat service to ask for updates, but the hold remained on the checks for 3 months, saying they were still ""investigating"". Finally, last month, they informed me they were closing my account for suspected fraud and that I couldn't dispute their decision. The sent a letter to my friend just last weekend announcing that the account had been closed, and the letter said ""If there was a positive balance in the account, a check will be included with this letter."" The letter included my final statement which showed I had $5050.01 in my account, but there was no check included. I got on the bank's chat program again and asked them about the status of the check, and they said they were still investigating the funds and there was no ETA on when (or even if) they would send the check.

It's already been 6 months since my friend deposited those checks. I think that's more than enough time to ""investigate the funds"". To me, it sounds like the bank just intends to keep the money and never return it to me. Do I have any legal options to get this bank to stop stringing me along and return my money to me? I'm sick of this and just want it to be over so all involved can move on.

**EDIT 1:** Here's the redacted letter my friend received. Again, no check was included with the letter, even though they also sent me a statement showing $5050.01 in my account:

[https://i.imgur.com/uSuqKPn.png](https://i.imgur.com/uSuqKPn.png)

**EDIT 2 :** It seems like my next step is to contact the CFPB and the OCC. Hopefully this lights a fire under the bank and they just decide it's not worth the trouble dragging this out any longer. I mean, they already won. They closed my account and got rid of me as a customer. All I want is my money back and I'll be on my merry way. 

Thanks for all the advice!"
24,24,Apartment won’t give my application deposit back,"My boyfriend and I applied for an apartment last November with a $750 application fee/holding deposit and were denied after waiting a whole month to hear back (we were fresh out of grad school and couldn’t provide pay stubs, we toured the place and they said offer letters from our jobs would be okay then went back on their word, but that’s beside the point). We were told we would get the deposit back within 4-6 weeks. 

We were about to start the process of moving out of the apartment we stayed in during grad school, and each of us went to our parents’ homes for the holidays. When we were rejected, I spoke with someone on the phone AND sent an email asking them to send our check to my parents’ address instead, knowing it would take forever. I have an email from them confirming they had received my email and would request the check be sent there. 

Well we never got the check back and obviously ended up moving into a different apartment building in the same area. I went in person back in January and was told they had sent the check to the old address, our graduate school apartment, despite their email confirmation that it would be sent to my parents’ address! They said they would cancel the original check and issue a new one, to expect it in 3-4 weeks. It’s been 3 months and nothing. We’ve tried calling, they never answer. Emailing, they never get back to us. Our work hours don’t align with their hours, so now that we’ve started our jobs it’s impossible to go in person. What are our options and what are the laws about this? We’re in New York if that matters."
0,0,UPDATE - Kid put stuff in yard; ran over it with mower; mother wants me to pay.,"Thought I’d update you all since so many people offered advice in the original post yesterday.

Brief summary of what happened: Neighborhood kid left his phone in my grass while I was mowing and I mowed it by mistake. The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.

Well she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I’d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn’t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn’t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that’s how she keeps track of him.

I told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I’d give him the phone.

He instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he’d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.

Left and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)

I had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.

I had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won’t always work out like this.

I also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I’ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) 

He again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he’d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I’d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.

I hope I’ve done the right thing and didn’t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn’t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.

Thanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it."
1,1,"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

2,2,"(Update) Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything."
3,3,"[UPDATE] Neighbors entrusted me with looking after their pets/house for 3 weeks, it has been almost a year now and they haven't come back. Today their basement flooded, and i have no idea what to do.","My original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ggtnwp/neighbors\_entrusted\_me\_with\_looking\_after\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ggtnwp/neighbors_entrusted_me_with_looking_after_their/) 

Good news, i followed everyone's advice reached out to the police and the embassy. Explained the situation, and gave them a bunch of information. 

Tonight i got a phone call from them, explaining they just decided to stay much much longer and spend time with family/friends. They apparently asked his wife's brother to come and collect the animals and get the key a long time ago back in August, but never followed up on it.

He apologized and said he was sorry, he gave me two options, and asked if i wanted to keep his pets since i have had them for so long, or he will push his step brother to get the animals. Apparently the animals don't really mean anything to him or his wife which i feel is quite shitty.

He apparently can no longer access his email, and passed me along a new email address/phone number i can use to contact him. But told me he doesn't have plans to return to Canada anytime soon.  I mentioned the water damage, and he just said they can buy a new house or get it fixed when they get back. 

He was also quite confused and somewhat annoyed, about the lengths we went to get in touch with him. He didn't understand why we reached out the embassy. He then offered to send me a bunch of money to square away the inconvenience, and that was more or less it.

I don't know if it is a cultural thing, however i feel kind of pissed off at how little he/his wife seem to care about the pets/his house. 

Anyways me and my wife are going to keep the pets simply because well i don't think ether of us can part with the dogs and his cat at this point."
4,4,Happy Holidays from the team here at /r/legaladvice,
5,5,I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor.,"This is in north Texas. 

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

6,6,Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20’s, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven’t consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter’s car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like “The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby.” As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone’s screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I’m calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn’t get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their “duty” to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. "
7,7,"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!"
8,8,"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.","I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.

I hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me."
9,9,"An update on ""My ex has a restraining order against me and now lives in the same apartment complex""","The public defender that represented me was no longer practicing in the NYC area but I retained a lawyer who was a friend of a friend who had experience in this area.

My lawyer got references from my PO, Employer, and AA Sponsor.

Our goal was to get the restraining order modified to a simple no-contact order with no distance requirements so I could continue living with my partner. I spoke to the Judge told him my story, what I had done to correct my past transgressions.  He reviewed my record. We submitted our references.

During this time period I was crashing on a friends couch as to not vioalte my propective order.

&#x200B;

* PO said I had paid my fines, followed all the rules, and never once had to remind me of my restrictions, and so forth and said he was impressed with my turnaround.
* My employer said that I was always early, never seemed to be under the influence or hangover from anything, and even at our company functions was very open and honest about my sobriety and didn't partake in drinking
* My AA Sponsor said good things about me too, how he was impressed with my maturity, and openness on my alcoholism and addiction.

Then the Judge asked my ex-wife to speak. My ex-wife said she was shocked by my turnaround. She said that it seemed unfair to her to require me to move because she moved into my building unknowingly and that she no longer felt threatened by me. This was a shock to both my lawyer and I as I expected my Ex to want to keep the protective order in place.

The Judge said that he wouldn't modify the protective order but lift it entirely as he felt it had served its purpose and that based upon my references, my testimony, and most importantly the testimony of my Ex that he didn't see how keeping it place was benefiting anymore.

He did tell my Ex that if she ever felt threatened or in danger because of something I said or did she could contact the police. The Judge then told me his main reason for lifting the order was to allow me to live in my current apartment but advised it was a good idea to avoid contact with my Ex to avoid any potential complications down the road. He reminded me because of my past it wouldn't take much to get another procetive order put in place. I told the Judge I had no intention of talking/contacting to my Ex and I was thrilled that I don't have to move and get to stay with my current girlfriend. 

So over the course of this weekend I moved back into my apartment with my girlfriend. I'm glad this was resolved."
10,10,Cop keeps pulling me (22f) over just to mess with me,"Hi, I made this account today because I’m really upset right now and I need to know if I have any grounds to get this man to experience any type of disciplinary action.

I live in a small town in Wisconsin so the cops kind of know everybody. But there’s this one cop who keeps pulling me over for the most craziest and asinine reasons like I was too close to the curb or I stopped too close to the stop sign. He’s a young attractive cop and I’m young and attractive as well so I’m thinking he’s trying to flirt with me or something? But the situations are so aggravating and the things he says and does seem like he’s intentionally trying to antagonize me so that I’ll say or do something out of anger and he’ll have an excuse to escalate the situation.

But today he crossed the line. He pulled me over again under the guise that I wasn’t going the speed limit (it was 45 I was going 50) and when he came to my car and said his usual bullshit in the most condescending way he said he had to search ME, not the car, because my car smelled funny. My car smells like vanilla and I’ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he’ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don’t comply he’ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin tight skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.

I’m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I’m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?

I have a GoPro in my car but idk if it caught this on camera I didn’t check yet."

Thanks to everyone’s terrific advice, I got my university’s ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school’s general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration’s decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors’ incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I’ll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward. 

Thank you everyone here who took time to give me such helpful advice. I appreciate all of you! "
12,12,"UPDATE: My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... I GOT CUSTODY!!!","**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me."
13,13,My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I’m growing very worried,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>”

“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” 

I’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”

I’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”

She won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

14,14,[oregon] I accidentally created an army of crow body guards. Am I liable if my murder attempts murder? UPDATE: The crows saved a life,"Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ki6fnd/oregon_i_accidentally_created_an_army_of_crow/?sort=top)

So to make a long story short, i called our local Audubon society. They didn't think feeding the crows was bad and suggested that the neighbors also start feeding them so they essentially became better socialized.

The plan worked and the crows are now a beloved part of the community. There have been no recent dive bombings.

Most amazingly, the crows may have legitimately saved my neighbor. Our city had a pretty big ice and snow event recently. Like i said in my last post, most of my neighbors are older. One of my neighbors was walking down his steep driveway, slipped, and couldnt get back up.

The crows started going *ballistic* and were making more noise than we have ever heard. A different neighbor went outside to see what was up and found the gentleman in his driveway. Neighbor is mostly ok! Just some serious bruises. 

Needless to say the crows have been getting some high value food since then.

Thanks for all the help on my original post. It blew up way more than i was expecting and i thought you guys would enjoy an update."
15,15,"Regular customer tipped me scratch tickets for years. I finally won something, and they are threatening legal action because I don't want to give them a cut. [FL]","Florida.

I worked as head bartender for a local restaurant for a number of years, and there was a regular customer who was there very frequently. I interacted with this customer frequently: they tipped *exclusively* in scratch tickets and specifically called to ask for my schedule, asked me out on multiple occasions, et cetera. Probably about forty years my senior. If you've ever watched The Good Place, this guy was IRL Brent.

I won something from the scratch ticket that wasn't five/ten dollars: the final amount after taxes was about three months salary for me, and I was making good money. I specifically didn't tell the customer not because I thought they would want it but because I didn't want them feeling like I owed them something or that I should be thankful towards them. I did tell a coworker, and it got to him through the grapevine.

The next time I came in, he congratulated me and asked how we wanted to split it. I sternly told him that it was my tip and long story short he went to my manager, who took his side. I quit (had been planning to anyway since I'm about to finish school).

My manager GAVE THIS GUY MY EMAIL (I'm curious on the legality of this too) and he (customer) emailed me saying that if I didn't agree to give him 50% he'd take legal action.

Do I need to worry about taking his threat seriously? Is there anything I can or should do to protect myself? I'm assuming this is a bluff but I want to have my bases covered.

TL;DR: Me drink lady. Mean man who buy many drinks gives me scratchy scratchy papers instead of green paper for many days. One day scratchy scratchy says me get a lot of green paper, but man no like this when he hear because he want some of green paper too. Me say no, green mine, so he say that he take swift and immediate legal action if me no comply. Me no need comply, right?"
16,16,Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. "
17,17,"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told ""good luck"". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car."

19,19,Subaru Service center gave my car to someone else,"FINAL UPDATE

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. 

<EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!

20,20,"Update, my son took the Boba Fett figure.","So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200B;

So, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200B;

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end."

22,22,[CO] My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. She now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. I want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.,"Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200B;

We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200B;

Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you."
23,23,Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. "
24,24,[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!"
25,25,Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. "
27,27,Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. "

29,29,Can I get a paternity test on myself?,"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad. I casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it. 

TLDR I think my dead sister is my real mom. In Florida btw."
30,30,"[FL] My parents have joined some new age ""religion"" and intend to move me to a compound against my will. What can I do to get the hell out of here?","So I really don't know how to start this so i'll get right too it.

&#x200B;

My mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. Because of this I have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

&#x200B;

This Monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200B;

I need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200B;

I'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him. My 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. My sisters dad is going to call cps too and I just got done with my call to them but I wont repeat what they said here. I will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to Florida immediately if I don't check in with him or he hears I went back to her. He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. They both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). I also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. My dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. Thanks guys for the advice."
31,31,I exposed my chest at work as proof I had breast cancer after boss and coworker were spreading rumors that I didn’t actually have cancer. Arkansas,"I had breast cancer about a year and a half ago. I got surgery and took FMLA. Luckily I didn’t have to undergo chemo or radiation. Surgery was able to remove all my tumors. I still have check ups and screenings occasionally and have to miss work. Another coworker in another department has breast cancer but unfortunately was unable to hand it removed by only surgery and had to be out longer. She is still undergoing treatment. 

I declined reconstruction on my breasts so I was able to come back to work at 3 1/2 weeks. My FMLA is intermittent. I do take it occasionally for those check ups and screenings because I am at high risk of it returning. 

I have no breast on my left side (just a flat scar - no breast tissue) and I have no nipple and only a smaller amount of breast tissue on my right side (they removed a lot of breast tissue with a lumpectomy but were able to salvage about 55% of the breast tissue). I have no nipples. 

I did something very dumb because I am a very dumb person. 

My coworkers and my immediate supervisor have been talking about my breast cancer for weeks because I had to miss an important meeting for a breast MRI and a bone scan. I requested off. Got my manager and HR to approve it. Converted under my FMLA signed by my oncologist. 

They have been spreading rumors that because I came back to work so soon that I didn’t have breast cancer. I wear a prosthetic at work so no one sees me flat. They are saying everyone they know with any cancer always has to take a lot of time off work and I seem fine. 

They (coworkers and supervisor , not my manager or HR) are saying I am abusing FMLA. 

Someone said they saw me out at the store (after an oncology appointment that was approved by my manager I did stop by the grocery store on my way home) and I looked fine. Again I am not on chemo so my appointments are check ups and blood draws. I feel fine after. They are emotionally draining but physical I feel great. 

It got to the point where I was scared to even take appointments because I knew coming back to work would be the worst. Again, my manager has always been supportive and HR too. This is just my supervisor and my coworkers. 

I have a surgery coming up to help with some scarring. They are just going to clean up some of the tissue now that everything has healed and I have been cancer free for over a year. I let my supervisor know they are thinking about scheduling it for the summer and he said “right the cancer thing again”. 

One particular day last week, I got upset because I heard them in the office next door talking about me. They were saying I was scamming everyone and that I didn’t deserve the upcoming raises. About how I didn’t have cancer. I got upset and I walked over and I lifted my shirt and prosthetic bra and showed them the scars on my chest. I did cover my remaining 55% there breast with no nipple with my hand but my scars were on display for all to see. 

I then told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my desk. This was on Friday at 3:30 pm. I left at 4:30 like I always do. No one has said anything. It is now Monday and I am worried. I had time to think over the weekend and realized it was a huge mistake. I should have just gone to HR about the gossip. 

I have seen my manager but they haven’t said anything. My supervisor hasn’t said anything. None of my gossiping coworkers have said anything. The ones that don’t gossip haven’t said anything and are acting like normal. 

What should I do to un-mess this up? What can I expect them to do to me legally? Could the coworkers I exposed my chest to call the police? My husband said they likely could but probably wouldn’t. Do I get a lawyer now and ask his advice? Would I hurt myself more by going to my manager and HR and saying “ I messed up”? I am so worried and confused. Any legal advice would be appreciate. I image if they did fire me something like this would keep me from unemployment right? I know they can legally fire me for any non protected reason and this isn’t protected."

34,34,"GF's dad filled out her mail-in ballot, forged her signature, and sent her a photo of the completed ballot with the caption 'If anybody asks, you voted.'","My girlfriend was furious.

I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.

Edit: This is in Arizona.

Edit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him ""throw it out"" and risk it being submitted.

35,35,[Texas] I [23F] had sex with a 17-year-old. He told me he was 19. He took a video of us having sex without my consent and is threatening to share it. What can I do?," We met on Tinder in December and started seeing each other in January. We've slept together a handful of times. I decided it would be best to stop seeing each other around the start of last month when they started telling people to stay away from each other.

At first he was really understanding but over the past couple weeks he's been pushing to see me more. I kept trying to make plans to see him once everything has calmed down but he's been insisting on coming over to my place despite everything. Yesterday I finally put my foot down and let him know we wouldn't be meeting now or later since I didn't like how pushy he was being.

He called me and we got into it because I wouldn't let him come over. Once we hung up, he snapped me a video of us HAVING SEX in his fucking car. I don't even know when he took it. It's dark so you can't really see me but it's clearly my voice. On the video he wrote that I would either let him come over or he'd send the video to my boss and tell his mom because HE'S 17. I told him I was out of town because my sister had her baby (which is true) but he could come over when I got back. I was afraid if I told him no straight up that he'd send the video.

I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS 17. I NEVER would have slept with him. I have screenshots of his Tinder profile where his age is clearly listed as 19. I don't have a Facebook so we were never friends on there but I do have his Insta and SC and nothing on those indicates he's 17. I keep thinking back over all of our interactions but even in text messages he doesn't say anything to indicate he was in high school.  He told me he went to a local community college, he talks about college classes and getting off of his job at HEB. Anyway it's not like we had long conversations; our relationship consisted of having sex and maybe getting dinner beforehand.

Please help me. I've been freaking out about this for several hours. I work with kids right now and I'm in school to be a school social worker, I can't have this on my record. I know I should probably go to the cops but how can I do that and make sure nothing comes out of this???"
36,36,[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Edit: I'm going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I'm taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that Adderall does when wearing off.

37,37,Ex-wife is suing me for child support. I don't even have a penis... (update),"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I have both good news and bad news.

The good news is that I won the battle with my ex. I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

The bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. 

Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. "
38,38,(Update) My bank put my account under another account and refused to fix it or refund the money,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d5p1oh/my_bank_put_my_account_under_another_account_and/

I submitted an OCC complaint against my bank the same day I posted, about 2 weeks later the bank called me and asked me what day works for me and I would be meeting their National Enterprise Financial Crimes Director himself at my local branch or if I did not want to come in they would come to my house even after business hours.

The next week I go in and meet him, he does nothing but apologizes for about 20 minutes and tells me they will immediately cut me a check and or give me cash for the missing funds that were transferred to the ""mistakenly approved parent account"". I quote that phrase because he said it exactly like that about 20 times.

I tell him great, I'll take cash since I have already opened a new account elsewhere and do not intend to continue to use their services since it took me reporting them to a government agency before they did anything at all to fix the situation that was clearly their fault. 

He tells me that's fine and he understands but he just needs me to sign a ""small document"" saying the situation has been remedied to my satisfaction, the ""small document"" is about 20 pages of stuff that I understand about half of but I can kind of see it's basically me saying that I am being refunded the money and I can take no legal action against them, can not talk about it and cannot tell anyone their mistake. Also that I must remove all ""public postings, mentions, anything negative about the bank from any online reviews or websites publically accessible"". Seems they found my reddit post.

He tells me that I cannot receive my money unless I sign this. I tell him definitely not since I cannot understand half of this and I leave without my money. So I once again file another OCC complaint online and call in to speak to someone. They tell me this is being escalated and to wait to hear from them, about a week later the bank is once again calling me for a meeting. I tell them I want nothing except a check mailed to my address on record and to leave me alone otherwise.

After a few calls a check finally showed up, for the full amount that was transferred to the parent account. Thanks LA for telling me about the OCC (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). They take complaints seriously and it's what it took to finally get this whole thing resolved."
39,39,"(AZ) Our neighbors dog was poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). Wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. I say absolutely not. How should we proceed?","I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

So they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

So we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. 

We had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" I was really taken aback and I think I asked ""I think so, do you need some?"" 

He then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


The officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) ""not yet."" 
I asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

I just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

She thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

Thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/

>Edit: hey guys I’m involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I’m sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don’t want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

41,41,"Cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing","I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I’m obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there’s any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there’s so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would’ve payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you.

I am now back in the US. It wasn't easy and took a long time mostly because my parents had hid all my American documents from me. But I found them, took originals and replaced them with copies. They never noticed.

The office of foreign interests at the Swiss embassy were very helpful although they didn't do anything until I had the documents proving that I'm a US citizen. I was able to exit Iran by going on a vacation with my family to Turkey and I just did not come back with them. The foreign interests office arranged everything so that I could go to the US consulate in Istanbul, they were already in the loop and were aware of my case, I had a quick interview and picked up my travel documents. My brother bought a ticket for me to fly to the US directly from Istanbul. I had a difficult time getting through airport immigration and had to answer questions for over an hour but in the end everything was fine.

Needless to say my parents are very upset with me but they have no control over me anymore. I now need to find a job and see what I can do for going to college. Thank you for the advice."
43,43,"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate."

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

45,45,Shot my stalker in the chest 5 years ago in self defense. He immediately started harassing me again a few days after being released from parole supervision.,"Throwaway because the stalker comments on pretty much every post I make on my main account. I even got flagged for karma manipulation for having a ""friend"" comment on my post. He's not my friend.

Anyway, 5 years ago I was stalked for six months by a guy I knew less than a month as an actual person. We dated very briefly, I broke things off and things seemed amicable until he started showing up outside my house and demanding I be with him or else. 


He had decided that he was a good man and he deserved a chance. He threatened that if he didn't get a chance, he'd kill me or hopefully Id kill myself.

After 6 months of daily threats, 10+ police reports, multiple restraining order attempts, moving, getting rid of all social media, he found me and kicked my door in at midnight. I ended up shooting him, after a lot of games on his part(refusing to come to court, self imposed starvation) he was finally sentenced and went to jail for 5 years.

I guess he was on parole for about 4 months after his release because I immediately started receiving messages and comments from him, he just picked right back up where he left off. I contacted the parole board and they said he was released from supervision a few days before.

I have contacted the police, was approved for a restraining order but of course they haven’t been able to serve it. 


They said they can’t prove the messages are from him despite him using his name, posting his pictures and literally commenting my name and talking about the shooting in comment replies. The detective is waiting for a subpoena from reddit to prove it’s him. I am documenting every bit of harassment of course..but I am just...exhausted.

I am so incredibly frustrated with the lack of help available and closed doors there are for people being stalked.

Is there anything else I can do in the mean time?"
46,46,"(MD) Lady is convinced she owns our house-- she tried to evict us, and is now sending her mail here to falsify proof of residence. Help please?","Background:

My husband and I bought a house in 2016 from a bank, as it had foreclosed upon the previous owner. About a year after we moved in, the previous owner showed up at our front door and tried to push past my sister to get into the house, saying she owned it. She left after threatening to call the police, but showed up 4-5 more times over the next 1.5 years, doing the same thing. She brought the police herself once, and they told her to leave once we showed him our contracts from closing on the house. He said that if she came back it would be considered trespassing, and included in his paperwork that she wasn't welcome on the property-- fortunately she hasn't been back since then. We invested in a Ring doorbell and security cameras near each door after the first two visits.

&#x200B;

After that she brought us to housing court in 2018 to try to evict us (from the house we own) but did not show up because she put our address down as her own in the paperwork, therefore never received the notice to appear since her copy was mailed to us. Fortunately we have title insurance and they send a lawyer to represent us for free, and the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. About a year later, she did the exact same thing but showed up to court saying she has a certified deed to the house so she owns it. The same lawyer represented this time, and the judge dismissed it again.

&#x200B;

The mail part:

A bit over a year ago we began receiving her monthly phone bill in the mail (she didn't just forget to change the address after she moved, there was a 2-3 year gap with no mail in her name) so my husband brought a few of them, unopened, to the post office, explained what had been going on, and they said they'd take care of it. Then in summer 2019, the key to our mailbox no longer worked-- it turned out she brought her deed to the post office, said she lost her key, and asked them to change the lock and give her a new key. Fortunately when my husband realized the key didn't work, he went to the post office and was able to intercept before they gave her the new key, so I don't believe she actually gained access to the mailbox.

During this time, the cell phone bills never stopped, and we've been receiving more mail in her name (from a radiology office, the Motor Vehicles Association, and other random non-spam items). I worry she's trying to do the same thing again-- have mail sent to our address, steal it somehow, and attempt to use it to prove residency.

My husband said when he told the post office manager what had been happening, they would report it, but we haven't heard anything at all-- and as I mentioned, the mail in her name has increased since then. I tried calling the Post Inspector's hotline, but it went to voicemail and I've never gotten a response from any voicemail I left to them.

I'm just kind of at a loss of what my next move should be? I just want this mess to be over."
47,47,[Update] [Iowa] City threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors,"This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

Hello r/legaladvice,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. 

So I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

Skipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

Once I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.

Of course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

A few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

This was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

I spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.
2. They must pay legal damages to me.
3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.
4. They must write an apology letter to me.
5. My favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.

All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. I'm super grateful to the ACLU for helping me with this, because as I said above, I wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. I'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the ACLU -- thank you for all of the help!"

I'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. It was very helpful.

After the post my SO and I decided to get a hotel. When we came back this morning the power was back on. My neighbor told me what happened:

Shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). The firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. Long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

The poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. I'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease."

She told me to avoid reaching out to him but to be prepared if he reached out to me. I downloaded a call recording app and started backing up my screenshots of our texts and messages. He did unmatch me on Tinder so thank you to everyone that warned me our conversations would go away.

He didn't say so, but I think he may have seen my Reddit post. I only say that because I know it made the front page and last night he called out of the blue to apologize and ask me to not call the police. So, either he saw it or he had a come to Jesus moment. He told me that he is 19 and that he only said he was 17 to scare me since I was being a bitch and wouldn't let him come over. When I told him to prove his age or I'd call the cops, he texted me a picture of his ID. He also says that it isn't me on the video but that he deleted it anyway. I'm not sure if this is the truth but I've got a recorded confession so that's something. 

I haven't spoken to the attorney since he called me but I did email her with a transcript and recording of our conversation. We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. I'm still going to be seeking legal action, I'm just not sure what action since his ID does say he's 19. In that case there was no CP although I know there's still a case for sextortion. I don't think it would be wise for me continue updating this situation on Reddit if he's here too so this will probably be the last thing I say about it. 

Thanks to everyone that has messaged me to be supportive, I really appreciate it. I can't respond to everyone because between PMs and chats, I'm sitting on 300+ messages about that post. Funnily enough, a nice chunk of them are from men calling me a pedophile, saying they hope I get raped since I'm such a slut, trying to figure out where in Texas I am so we can hook up, etc. This man tried to coerce me into having sex with him via blackmail and I'm the one getting blamed because I had sex with someone I believed was an adult. 

From this point on, I'll only be seeing men my age or older, and IDing everyone. According to the attorney, the fact that he looked old enough wasn't an excuse. This might sound dramatic but for most of yesterday, I really thought my life was over. Never again."
50,50,My daughter was bit by a raccoon with rabies. My wife does not want to give our daughter the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am taking her tonight to a hospital against my wifes wishes in secret.,"My daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. I killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

My wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. 

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. 

I need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. 

I am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

Is it kidnapping in this case?

Will I be arrested? 

What do I do if she calls in an amber alert?

I am desperate."
51,51,(UPDATE) NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

I went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. She took one look at the letter from my friend Aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

She contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me Aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if I heard more otherwise no need for more action.

Aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. He wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. I hadn't complained to them myself so I did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

Thanks for the advice in the previous thread, especially /u/Wittyandpithy's excellent not-practicing-legal-advice to actually pay to use a legal professional.

52,52,Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones."
53,53,Doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. I'm 22 and no longer even live with her.,"Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. 

I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!""

Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?

54,54,Mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that I said I don’t want to pay,"So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.

Anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

This isn’t legal right?

*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

Turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He’s stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she’ll give me the rest back and that she’s still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I’m at a loss what to do next.

*Update 3: Doesn’t sound like I’m getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

I’m still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can’t touch it. Just in case they get any ideas."
55,55,[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

For reference, I am 19 years old and I live in Colorado"
56,56,Daughter threatened with expulsion over t-shirt,"Due to the huge amount of PMs and chats that I've received and the fact that people in our district are identifying us by this post, I have removed the story to avoid being doxxed. We have no desire to go public and we do not want this story of sexual harassment to be attached to our daughter forever. Please leave us alone.

And to the person who messaged me and told me I should have never had children and that I'm taking feminism back a step, please reconsider your feeling of entitlement over my daughter's body, time, and life. Going public would have lasting ramifications for her social life and self esteem, particularly if subjected to internet trolls and the like. She is not obligated to dedicate the entirety of her emotional energy to an internet phenomenon. We are handling this without the media."
57,57,"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. 

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

Thank you to the user who suggested I look in the Facebook marketplace. I found it in there and got the name of the man who took it. 

I took that information to the police and the man had other complaints of petty theft against  him. 

Even better, one of the people who helped me move realized my neighbor has a video doorbell and I was able to get proof to the cops that the man stole my couch with me standing right there with a moving truck and boxes. 

A friendly officer went to his house and got my couch back, as well as a few other stolen outdoor furniture pieces (one was a bench from a local restaurant, I don’t know the other situations.) 

I deeply appreciate your legal advice, I now won’t have to tell my parents the beloved multi-generational couch is gone. Cheers"
59,59,(update) My autistic brother was banned from the local hobby shop.,"[So i came here yesterday to ask for some advice on my situation and I thought I might as well leave a update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9l2z39/co_my_autistic_brother_was_banned_from_the_local/)

&#x200B;

So I want to start out by saying that I was wrong and I want to apologize to anyone I may have hurt with my last question. It was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and I wish I could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. Me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200B;

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. This has been a learning experience for me and I hope that I can become a better person because of it."

Hey guys. I first just want to thank you all for all the support regarding my last post.

I’ve had a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer and have filed a police report like many of you suggested. I let my cousin and aunt and uncle know this and they immediately ended up offering to pay my hospital bill (and ambulance ride) in full.

My cousin gave me a half-hearted apology and his parents told me he won’t be leaving the house for the next year and will be severely punished for this.

I’ve decided not to press charges, I don’t really have the money/time for it, and all I needed was my medical expenses paid. I just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long LONG time.

Thanks again for all the love and support.

61,61,A former Air BnB guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (Texas),"Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

Edit:  Well that was quick~!  The Post Office called me directly before I could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  They're very certain what she did is illegal.  Thanks /u/BeamDriver for the advice!  Important lesson here kids:  Don't fuck with people's mail, because the USPS apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.

62,62,Can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?,.
63,63,[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Thank you all. "
64,64,Update. My parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.,"Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation I thought I would give you guys a update on everything. It's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i'm settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200B;

So after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200B;

My mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don't feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start. Thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. I really do appreciate it :)"
65,65,"Husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. How can I find an attorney with no money?","Tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. This is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. What is a surprise is it's suddenness.

I've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what I made on day-care.

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"". I would say I was shocked, but I really am not. He's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? I understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. I don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

I'm in Wisconsin, I've tried to Google up the best could since the little one went to sleep but I can't find what I'm looking for or even really know what I'm looking for. Thanks for anyone who helps"
66,66,"[ON] I caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. Family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. What can i do? - UPDATE","My original post is here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ayhlsu/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/)

Thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

A long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

I am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. "
67,67,[oregon] I accidentally created an army of crow body guards. Am I liable if my murder attempts murder?,"To make a long story short, im a late 20 something living in portland oregon. I had a pretty intense emo/goth phase as a tween that i thought i had grown out of. 

A couple months ago, i was watching a nature program on our local station about crows. The program mentioned that if you feed and befriend them, crows will bring you small gifts. My emo phase came back full force and i figured that i was furloughed and had lots of time- so why not make some crow friends. 

My plan worked a little too well and the resident 5 crows in my neighborhood have turned into an army 15 strong. At first my neighbors didnt mind and enjoyed it. They're mostly elderly and most were in a bird watching club anyway. They thought the fact that i had crows following me around whenever i go outside was funny. 

Lately, the crows have started defending me. My neighbor came over for a socially distanced chat (me on my porch her in my yard) and the crows started dive bombing her. They would not stop until she left my yard. 

They didnt make physical contact with her, but they got very close.

Am i liable if these crows injure someone since i fed them? I obviously cant control the crows. I would rather them not attack my neighbors. But since i technically created this nuisance, could i be financially on the hook for any injuries?

To be clear, they're not agressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbors are out they are friendly normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.

ETA: TL;DR- I have turned into Moira Rose, queen of the crows. My inadvertent crow army has gotten aggressive towards others. If they hurt someone could i be held liable?

ETA PT II: I did not train these birds to attack. Also thank you for all of your awards. Im glad my stupid decisions bring you joy. Please consider donating that money to your local Audubon society instead"
68,68,Dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. How do I protect myself legally?,"I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

The last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

They leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. 

They drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

They regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.

They have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

They like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. 

I have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. 

I recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

Since then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

The woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

I understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

I just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

She had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

They have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. 

I have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

I can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. 

They are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

If I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. 

All it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. 

I want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?"
69,69,Boyfriend and I slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. Landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out,"This happened in Ontario, Canada.

So this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

I found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

For more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

All we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

Boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

I dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. 

EDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

70,70,Caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result,"I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. 
There is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

I know I'm angry and grieving. But because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until I had to let her go. 

Is there anything I can do?"
71,71,"Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.","This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. 

We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

Once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""Do not worry! This won't happen again"". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.""

We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.

We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated."
72,72,[UPDATE] Fired from my job for salary discussion in NC,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f5tda9/got_fired_for_discussing_salary_at_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 

I posted back in February that I was fired from my job for discussing wages. This subreddit told me to file a charge with NLRB. They found merit in my case and I just got a settlement. Please please please even if you live in an at will state do the tough work of charging the company. You deserve to advocate for yourself."
73,73,"(MA) after giving me written permission to make a permanent decision, my ex changed her mind and has now decided to sue me for emotional damages. Advice needed--thinking of settling.","I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. 

I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. 

My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. 

In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): 

""Jess, 
I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. 

At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. 

L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. 

As always, she would love to see/hear from you.""


she replied to that email a short time later with ""thank you for the update"". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. 

After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. 

In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:

""Jess, 
I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."" 

and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:

""Jess, 
In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.""

She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. 

We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. 

Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. 

I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any ""left"", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. 

A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for ""failing to offer her our shared child's cremains"" and ""offering a used necklace"" and some other nonsense. 

I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? 

I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?"
74,74,Police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while I was asleep,"This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair

I have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

Also some of the throw up was on the seat we were sitting directly on...

His car was already a mess when he arrived. We would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. We were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later I was charged $100. What can or should I do?

Update: Lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. Also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver “Roy” (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... Who the fuck is Roy and where is my fucking money! 

Looking in to get the info behind the photos. Still no reply from Lyft. Used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.

77,77,Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread."

T-Mobile ideally should be held accountable for allowing this to happen, but I'm not sure if it holds up because I haven't seen any cases that have won in this exact scenario. What can she do?

Edit: A few details: We live in a Southern State in the US and the scammer walked into a TMobile store in California.

79,79,Mother keeps sending police to my apartment for welfare checks,"I’m 23 and have been living away from my mother since I was 18. She has sent police to my house / school / work multiple times over the past 5 years. The only reason she does this is because I don’t reply to text messages quickly enough (I’m talking 30 minutes and she’s panicking and sending police to find me). I have been very explicit in telling her to not do this. I have set up a rule where she must give me 48 hours to reply. I recently increased this to a week. She has ignored all of this and instead threatened to file a missing person report if I didn’t reply. Literally 2 days ago she moved within 8 minutes of me when I said I didn’t want her living that close. 

I feel harassed and frightened in my own home. I am done trying to work this out with her. Is there any legal recourse I can take?

80,80,[MN] A girl is planning to claim I am the father of her baby when we never had sex,"I've been living in a foster home since January '18. I turn 15 in March. The foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. She blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. I never had sex with her, and I would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. Unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. The foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

I can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. I said I would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks I will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. She is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her."
81,81,"Neighbors entrusted me with looking after their pets/house for 3 weeks, it has been almost a year now and they haven't come back. Today their basement flooded, and i have no idea what to do.","In June 2019 my neighbors came to my door, i had some experiences with them (they invited us for a BBQ not long after they moved in). They asked me and my wife if we would look after their pets, and their house for the next 3 weeks, as they needed to return to Taiwan as his mother was dying. They even left me $500 dollars for food for their 2 German Shepards, and their cat.

I don't know what happened to them, but they just never came back. I don't know if they ended up in some sort of prison, or decided to just not come home at all. Today i found out their basement had flooded, probably sometime within the last week. Apparently a pipe burst, but the entire basement is completely fucked. I paid for have the leak fixed, and i spent all of today using my shop vac to drain their basement to the best of my abilities.

Between this and one of their dogs needing surgery i have spent several thousand dollars of my own money, and frankly the damage to the basement was pretty awful. I don't have their insurance paperwork, and don't really know if i can even do a claim for them.

On top of this his two giant German Shepards while they are amazingly good boys, it is becoming almost too much for us to handle. Their last name is extremely common, and their Facebook profiles are private. Which gives me very little avenue to tackle this down.

Timeline:

* June 07, 2019 - Neighbors asked me if i would look after their pets, and their house while they were handling the death of his mother back in Taiwan. Told me 3 weeks at latest.
* July 1st, 2019 - Neighbors sent me an email stating they needed some additional time to handle his father's affairs. He apologized and said he would be back by July 15th at latest.
* July 21st, 2019 - Sent him an email asking what was going on, explained how we were going on vacation in August. Never got a response.
* July 31st, 2019 - Tried calling him on his cellphone, # he was given to me was no longer in service.
* August 14th, 2019 - Went on vacation, had my brother look after all 4 dogs, for the next week.
* September 2nd, 2019 - Emailed him again, no response.
* September 3rd, 2019 - Tried to reach him and his wife via Facebook using the private message feature.
* September 6th, 2019 - Ended up moving his 2 dogs, 1 cat into our house as they seemed extremely miserable. I ended up disassembling part of our adjoined fence to allow his dogs to use their outdoor area.
* November 19th, 2019 - One of his dogs started showing signs of being ill, brought him to the vet turns out he is suffering from a medium severity case of IVDD. He ended up requiring surgery which we paid for.
* January 21st, 2020 - Sent another email and never got a response.
* Today - When i was bringing his mail in to his house, i noticed it smelled pretty awful and i quickly discovered his basement had about a foot of water in it.

Questions:

* What exactly is my level of responsibility in this. I agreed to look after it for a few weeks/couple of months at the most. It has almost been a year now.
* Is there anything i can do?

**Location: Ontario, Canada**

Sorry some other points:

* I am assuming they have some sort of auto payment for bills setup, because they still have hydro/cable/internet.
* I am unsure where exactly the husband worked, i know he said he was an engineer, however i cannot find his linked in profile, so i don't know what company.
* Their last name is a very common name (common like Wong), which gives me tons of facebook results. "
82,82,NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

Early in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9skxh8/i_was_arrested_kept_in_jail_for_62_days_and_then/?utm_source=reddit-android

I've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. I want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. I can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. There most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

To answer the endless messages I received about race, I am white and early 20's, the person I was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

I spoke to my boss and HR and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with OT. Also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

84,84,"UPDATE - [MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy. Thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice."

UPDATE 2.5: There’s been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don’t need to always make a “special request” to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it’s a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is “not an obstructive item”.

Amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3


UPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA “escalating out of control”. They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don’t want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 But that it’s up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don’t want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

She assured me that I won’t get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I’m NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don’t plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

For those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I’m a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

Forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It’s just that I talked back (“no I don’t but okay“) and I regret that so much. 

Halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

Someone asked if it’s a racial thing. I’m not white but it’s probably not a related to race. 

Many of you guys advised not to delete the post and keep it here in case this happens to someone else and they need answers. Hope this helps.

UPDATE 1: Thank you so much for your quick advice on a Sunday morning! I memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

As we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

“The police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights.” 

“Ok.” 

“Oh I hope so.” As she walked away. 

I burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. 

There was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I’ve been an emotional wreck and can’t stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. 

My seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. 

Thank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least!

Original post: 

I can’t believe this is happening to me. I’m flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don’t have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

Edit: I’ve looked all over the internet and can’t find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

Here’s what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

“You have to put your feet on the ground!” I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

“No I don’t but okay.” As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I’ve taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it’s technically not allowed by some rule I’m not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
“Would you like to go back to the gate? We’re gonna go back to the gate!” And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
“Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.”

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, “no I don’t but okay” are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic inside. I’m now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. 

Am I fucked?"
88,88,Kicked our at 16. Parents took all my money.,"I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

Three nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

I managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. 

I'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations. 

I live in Tennessee. Any advice would be helpful. 

I also do not want to return home. My mother is abusive. DCS has seen physical evidence of abuse (black eye, bloody scratch marks, bruises) and placed me back in the home. They are useless."
89,89,Work Punishments Include Drinking Soap and Other Abuse,"My girlfriend works at a retail store in California. They are supposed to ask customers if they want to buy a particular item and there is a punishment board for not doing so. The employee is allowed to choose their punishment from a punishment board.

The punishments are either very hard and often demeaning work or obviously illegal punishments. The hard work is things like cleaning toilets or moving heavy objects. Other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

Is this illegal? They could argue these obviously illegal punishments are not mandatory, but there is an incentive to do them because the other punishments are so difficult."

My family makes fun of me for being vegan (though I cook for myself for all meals and don’t mention It much at all) Anyway, I guess some of my extended family didn’t know the severity of my allergy because my younger cousin [16 M] chopped up steak (extremely finely I guess) and put It in my butternut squash soup.
Shorty after I ate some of my soup I couldn’t breath and was breaking out in hives. I woke up in the hospital on Christmas Day. (My mom called an ambulance when she saw my face was swelling). My cousin didn’t say sorry when I started breaking out in hives. He started laughing and told me what he had done.
I woke up to a text from him saying “stop overreacting you need protein” with a picture of a slaughtered cow. His parents aren’t very well off (in fact I don’t think they have insurance). I just want to know, should I pursue a legal case? Or is that an overreaction.

91,91,"My niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.","Located in Oklahoma, USA

My sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.

Update: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. Thank you to the people who were helpful!"

When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

Well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

We did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn’t good enough?? She said that it had a “different balance” on all the receipts but that’s because it was layaway and I made payments! 

She told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof?

94,94,My daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her,"(WI) Just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

Left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

On the second day I was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman I had never seen before in my life. 

I jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she’d found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman’s intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

I drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

I was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. 

This occurred on Friday and I have yet to receive a response. I would like to know if I can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if I can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges.

95,95,"Exwife is going off the deep end. This is in NJ, USA. Can I do anything here?","I get my daughter every other weekend. She’s 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

This weekend, we were watching a movie when I got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

Now, I don’t attach myself to my phone (unless I’m working) and I got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I’d be up to tuck her in. 

I went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone “YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!”

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn’t true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear “daddy is going to leave the room now, please don’t stay on the phone long, it’s way past your bedtime.” (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he’s a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she’s repeating “I’m sorry” into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn’t until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn’t speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

I’m sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. Divorce is hard enough on children, and I think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be. 

What can I do?"
96,96,"UPDATE: Hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. Building management’s negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (TO, Canada)","Link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

First I want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and I are quite happy with. I’ve been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

Through the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me “if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?” To which I replied “150%”. He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said “no.” 

Shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don’t want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn’t seem happy. As if the whole floor isn’t already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

I explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. 

The bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I’m guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

The city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they “didn’t know” and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from “submit a maintenance request” to “we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately” in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

Thank you so much Reddit!!! I couldn’t have done it without your help!! 

Here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. "
97,97,Police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him,"This happened last week, he's only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords."
98,98,"[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that?","For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200B;

My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200B;

So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?"
99,99,(va) My son stole a rare toy from my brother. My brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. What do I do?,"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.

&#x200B;

Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200B;

Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200B;

I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?"
100,100,(Ohio) Woman sent me video of her setting my priceless painting (family heirloom) on fire because I called CPS on her,"My boyfriend’s sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so I called Child Protective services on her months ago. I was living up there near his family and long story short, when I drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) He forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. She and her husband sent me a video saying “this is for calling CPS, bitch.” They’re both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. 

Do I have any ground to sue or press charges? I wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before I go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. This was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. I would give everything I own just to get it back. I’m living in Florida and this is all in Ohio. "
101,101,"Bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because I dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?","I have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way I dress. My neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

About a month ago, I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. I didn't expect any trouble. My first introduction to this woman, let's call her Karen, was my first week here. I went to check the mail and I wasn't wearing a bra. I had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. Karen is one of *those* Southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. You know the type. She waved at me and I waved back, trying to be pleasant. She came at me, I thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying. 

This is in Florida, by the way.

EDIT: I got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (I do not regularly dress like this) I must have been quite a sight to Karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. She started laying into me. I just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then I said ""you can stop the games, Karen. I see the way you look at me, I know you want me."" Her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""I'll pray for you."" Then scurried away. Actually went inside her house. 😂"

TL;DR of last post: Got a letter from a firm to prepare for a lawsuit for battery to someone i preformed the Heimlich on. 


Well, I took y’alls advice and went back to the restaurant, i spent about an hour and a half waiting and then speaking with a shift manager who called the general manager who called the owner, and they swore up and down that no one had come to ask for a tape or anything of the sort. 

Then i started looking for defense attorneys but I wasn’t sure exactly how to proceed, honestly this week i’ve been mortified and really on edge. Finally when i told my friends about everything one of them fessed up to the fact that it was actually them and they made it up as some kind of prank. Pretty twisted joke, I wasn’t laughing. I’m pretty pissed and seriously reconsidering my relationship with him. I appreciate everyone’s support, excluding the people who made fun of my mother’s death or tried to figure out where i lived. 

TL;DR: Friend made a fake letter from a law firm, soon he might be able to sue me for battery "

105,105,My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200B;

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200B;

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

&#x200B;

Is there anything they can do at this point? I feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. It makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it."
106,106,A male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. He just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.,"Spa is in Maryland. A friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it’s ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. He is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. He has not spoken with management yet. He just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. Any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

Edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it’s a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

I’m guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. The mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

Thank you everyone for the comments. If this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. "
107,107,Update: Neighbor bangs on shared duplex wall when baby cries,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/isdpid/delusional_neighbor_bangs_on_the_shared_wall_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My first post never got much attention but the outcome was pretty wild. 

Short version: In October 2020, my husband and I were renting in a duplex where my FIL owned the half we lived in, and a separate family (adult daughter acting as caregiver to elderly mother) owned the other half. We brought our son home from the NICU in August, and towards the end of September the neighbor (40sF) started to pound on the shared wall if she could hear him cry. The pounding escalated over the next two months. The neighbor bought a megaphone to yell through the wall and threatened to “rip us apart”, she called us child predators, and she’d yell obscenities and threats until 3 or 4 in the morning. 

The police were called multiple times, nothing could be done about it. One officer told us “I’m going to kill you. See, it doesn’t mean anything if I don’t actually do it.” The elderly mother hadn’t been seen in several months, but requests for wellness checks were brushed off. 

The general advice I got was that as renters, we couldn’t do anything. It was also suggested that this was reasonable behavior, since the crying baby was probably really annoying. 

Since my first post, we moved in with my grandmother for our safety. The neighbor ended up busting a softball sized hole through the shared wall to scream at us, and occasionally just stare at us. The smell that came out of the hole was indescribably bad. Our security cameras recorded her coming to my son’s nursery window at around 2am almost daily, just staring and holding her cat. 

It took until the end of January for the police to be able to enter her property. The elderly mother had been deceased since at least June, and the daughter had the corpse dressed in her Sunday best, rotting in a dead bolted bedroom. The news article said the mother died from natural causes. The daughter was taken to an inpatient psychiatric facility."

I’m a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She’s grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather’s mom died. He’s Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather’s sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I’ve tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it’s starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I’m studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I’m not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she’s my little sister, and I’ve been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I’m a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn’t get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I’m barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven’t even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we’re now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

Edit: Thank you for all you advice. I apologize if I do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

Edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. However, I am currently ok, and my mom’s friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and I also have a little bit saved up. But I greatly appreciate your generosity"
109,109,"My daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (Washington)","On a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  She says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  So far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

We talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  This has not helped.  We escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  Not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

The principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  The read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  The principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

We are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  It shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  What obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?"
110,110,"Campus effectively removed all Men's restrooms, Administration is dragging its feet acknowledging there is a problem","New York State, United States

&#x200B;

So essentially with few exceptions, every male restroom on my campus has been converted into an ""All-Gender"" restroom. This sort of makes sense given that they are the only existing restrooms which contain both stalls and urinals. The problem herein lies that in addition to new signs on the doors, the primary door to the restroom has been equipped with a vacancy/occupied lock which locks from the inside. Essentially allowing a single individual (if they choose) to lock a bathroom with facilities accommodating up to 8 people at one time, reducing it to a single use restroom. On numerous occasions men have had to leave lecture halls and travel to other buildings with the hope that the All-Gender restroom in that building has not been locked also.

I've brought this issue to our school's department of diversity and equity where after 3 weeks of obfuscation I've managed to meet with with the department head and have a conversation with her, where I've essentially been told to shove it.

Is there any sort of Federal or NYS legislation with which I can bring to their attention and try to instigate real change?

I have no idea how to contact HOA or the property manager as my mother deals with them and every time the car was getting towed except the last time, she was the one to catch them and pay. I will be contacting the HOA with her when she gets home and will try and contact the property manager. My neighbor is a dick and and I will also be speaking to him personally when I get home. If legal action needs to be taken, we will definitely do so. Thank you!

Edit: talked to the property manager and they said they rescinded my permit. I asked them why and they said that they aren't doing those anymore. I told them they never gave me any indication of that and they said they didn't not plan on giving me any notice.

Edit: Final Update! 
Thank you everyone! I honestly could not have expected to get this much help! As of what happens next, we plan on taking legal action, mainly to get our money back, and because it seems that what may have happened with the permits wasn't strictly legal. I still need to talk personally with the HOA guy who conveniently doesn't answer his door when I knock, but he has two big ass dogs and will have to walk them eventually. It seems HOA tend to suck, especially in SoFlo. Thank you!"

They looked remarkably similar, and the post got a lot of views. Yahoo contacted me and asked permission to write a little fluff piece story on it. I gave them permission and some quotes to make a story. That was that. 

I’ve since realized that the picture has been taken and used by several anti abortion groups. One facebook post alone has over 14k likes and 6k shares. A different group published his picture, our full names and some of the quotes that I gave to yahoo in a newsletter. I don’t know if it was distributed in print or just electronically, or both. They ask people to join the $50 challenge in that article, and ask for donations of up to $5000. Are they are using a picture I took for financial gain? Also, IMO, the article leads the reader to believe I support their cause. My husband and I are pro choice, however. I absolutely hate that my baby’s face has been used in this way. I have no idea how many people the newsletter was sent to. 

Do I have any recourse? I understand that I put the picture out there. Is it fair game for anybody to use his images now?

116,116,"[US, OK] Disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.","To give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. There aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

I have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. By some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. For the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

The family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. From the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. Through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. These are VERY powerful, VERY fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

We've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. We've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. They have to be picked up on the street.

What can we do?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, we have confronted the neighbor and yes he intentionally did it knowing the kids were epilitic. He hates kids, and has made it very apparent even calling the lights ""brat repellent""."

119,119,"(update) School wants my son's Facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. WTF? [Florida]","This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. "
120,120,Girls assaulted nephew by kicking genitals. He’s in Emergancy surgery,"This afternoon I found out girls have been kicking my nephew in the crotch at school. He’s 12 years old and I imagine they’re close to his age. He told his grandmother he had bad pain and they went to the ER. The doc said 1 testicle is most likely dead and they’re trying to save it and check on the other in surgery. 
How can we move forward with this legally? He will very likely lose a testicle and may have serious health issues because of it. I can’t find much online except there is a class 3 felony of malicious castration, but I don’t know what that really means. I’m very angry and want justice for this child. Any advice on how we could move forward is helpful. I want them to pursue criminal charges and hold these people and their parents (or the school!) responsible for this life altering violent crime.

Edit: they live in NC. I don’t know the ages of girls but it’s happening at a middle school."
121,121,"UPDATE: Old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues I'm having."" Found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (MN)","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200B;

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200B;

***Thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. It's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. Glad to not be there anymore. I also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people."
122,122,Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point."
123,123,Update: I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents.

I just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). I was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

He was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. One of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). Unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

He gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

I also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* They both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. They aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* Apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. With her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. So now she is paying her way. 

Anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

Thank you so much for your help."
124,124,[WI] My girlfriend’s landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.,"My girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. He believed nobody to. Be home, but I was here laying in bed. I woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. When I said something as he was leaving he ignored me. I text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. He did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. He just came in, used the bathroom and left. He didn’t even finish flushing the toilet. 

When I confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. He then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. And when I explained to him that I had every right to be there because I had permission from the tenant to be there, he said “okay, I’ll let you go this time.” 

My girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. How can we make sure he doesn’t do this again? 

Also, the dude didn’t even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

Edit 1: the landlord is the property owner.

Edit 2: there was an empty unit across the hall."
125,125,"[UPDATE] This man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, I have a specific question regarding something I want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.","I would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here’s what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone’s day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid’s drone and frank’s drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would’ve ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father’s reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like “mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I’ll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away”."
126,126,"TSA detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the ER and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.","I'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

My father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a [port](https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  We came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (New York) facing the customer directly at our shop. They sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. I'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. However, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

Today, they were flying from TN (I don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to Houston, TX, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   He had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (Brooklyn, NY) and in Texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which I will request from his doctors tomorrow)  He also brings a printout from the TSA about traveling with a port and cancer which I will find the exact link to when I get more info.  

My parents arrive 3:45 to a Tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
Both parents have TSA pre and get on line at about 4. They are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  The agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the ID, etc.  My father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. Meanwhile I assume he is not speaking his best English, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. I'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which I think adds to the confusion. They wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. They don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

Both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  They go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   My father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  He calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  He tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (His first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) They take him into a small room away from my mother. He is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  The agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. The agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  My father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  I have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. He couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

He tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) The agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   The agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. My father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  They bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  They wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  They agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  They take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. He asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. By this point the plane has left.  They go to the ER to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

He has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  My father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  Port is OK but they want to check him out again before flying.

I would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. If he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  Can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? They have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. I am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so I have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that I can go over with her later, so I'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
My family is very quiet, I don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  I would if that is the only option, however.  I don't know if it's relevant that we are Muslim, either, I assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  My father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  I would love some advice.  Apologies for length.
Edit- I do not know if this is correct flair, if you want me to change it please advise."
127,127,I think my dads company is responsible for his death [California],"My dad passed away last week while at work. He had a massive heart attack. He was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. Here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

The doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. Last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so I'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

I spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. Is that true? I'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, I can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. "
128,128,Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"[The Mystery Fence](https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nQdq)

Delaware, USA. No homeowners association.

We live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. It's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. There was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). I removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

Well I come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. Part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. The leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

I don't know who owns it, so I called the real estate agent. He was just as shocked as I was when I told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. He had no idea. He'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. I asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. She didn't.

What do I do about this fence?"

130,130,Neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. It was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. How can I proceed legall?,"Long story short, I live in NY. My bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. I had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. Those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. This lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) I came home to my wood missing and I found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. Someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. I contacted the guy, and got it back. I then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the NY State Government Property Lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. I told her to never do that again and mind her own business. Her response was ""I am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. Good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" After that passive aggressive bullshit I went to the police. I filed for tresspassing. The cop said I could get her for possible larceny. Idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. I'm just wondering... how far can I push this? I am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town I live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. The cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... I have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people I didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that I had posted on my own FB that I was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. I work as a bartender in town, where I have many strange men I dont want knowing where I live. She posted it to my towns Facebook page. Maybe if she was more kind I would have let bygons be bygons but now, I'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear"""
131,131,(Update) School kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. Lawyers are expensive...,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

The past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. Now I can't go into a lot of the details after but I can go over some of the details that happened during.

We contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. We first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

Our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. Then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. So he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. Talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which I thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

He spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. During this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. Something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

So our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. The lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

Finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

Now I can't go into a lot of the details but I can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. Lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. I just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. We are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

Thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school."
132,132,"Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

I own an apartment in downtown Toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with AirBnB tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. Currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until January.

I decided to list my place up for a rental in late August, for rental until Janaury. Since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). I immediately got a hit by a person named Jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.She signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""No short term rentals, through services such as AirBnB"".

Yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* On Monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. Along with a strong smell of pot. They apparently identified themselves as AirBnB renters. (Apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through AirBnB).
* I am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* I am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* Apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

After getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on AirBnB, using very recent photos of my apartment. I tried to contact Jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

I have tried numerous times to talk to AirBnB, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

Aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. Unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. Do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*EDIT\* I forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. Since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. I want to stop randoms from AirBnB from entering my apartment now. "
133,133,Update: Bullied by coworkers who knock my cap off my head a dozen times a day.,"Update ([former post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/igxl19/bullied_by_coworkers_they_knock_off_my_cap_from/)) because I used your advice and it helped. When I went back to work I talked to my boss about the bullying and them knocking off my cap and I said it's making me miserable but again he didn't care. So I said that what they are doing is harassment and because they make fun of my speech impediment it's discrimination and if he doesn't do anything he's responsible for it. I saw he was pissed but still he talked to his boss. Then when he came back he yelled at me and the bullies for creating trouble and I thought we were going to be fired but that was it.  But then the next day the owner came (that rarely happens) and he talked to my boss and then to me, he told me the bullying would stop and to tell him if it didn't. At first the guys who were bullying me were moved to another part of the shop so they wouldn't be with me but the next day one of them was fired, not sure if it's over the bullying. Anyway it's good now thanks to you and I don't need to find a new job.

Edit: thank you very much for all the awards, that's very kind and I appreciate them but please don't spend your hard earned money on me, donate to your favorite charity instead! Thank you everyone again."
134,134,"UPDATE: I just recieved a demand letter from Enterprise Rent-a-Car stating that if I do not return their rental car, I will be charged with Embezzlement and Grand Theft Auto. I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens. 

"
135,135,Girlfriend was arrested w/ a DUI but blew a .06!!! Cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!,"So..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. She didn’t drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. When the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). On her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. A minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. She admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

This is when it gets interesting. 

The officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. He then declared that she was drunk WITHOUT HAVING HER BLOW TO TEST HER BAC, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

THEN, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! That’s below the legal limit (we are in Wyoming). And the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her BAC was. 

My question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? We have no money and probably can’t afford a good lawyer. I could barely afford her bail. She is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn’t deter her from pursuing her dream. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. We have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

Edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn’t tell her the Miranda rights (found out he doesn’t need to)


Edit: thank you all so much for the help

Edit: I am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). In this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. It was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an Uber. 

🚨Update 🚨
After reviewing the body cam footage, the prosecutor dismissed the case. I haven’t seen the footage myself, but according to her lawyer it was clear that she was not impaired."
136,136,My parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. I am sick of this shit (Florida),"For clarity we're both minors. I'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. She has never been right since we were little kids. Always violent. She bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when I was 5 because I wouldn't let her ride my bike. All of my life I've been putting up with this shit and I have had enough.

She hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. My parents wont do anything about it. She's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. I really don't know what is wrong with her. She's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. My parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. They refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". Which brings us to today. My parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. Whatever, not important.

Anyway, I was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. We decided to go to the Dollar Tree to get some snacks. Demon didn't buy anything. As we left the store I could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. I confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! I don't know why. Don't they make meth out of those or something? So I told her I was going to call mom. I pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! I was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was I going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. I took her down and had her pinned on the ground. That's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will NOT stop otherwise. I had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. She got me in the throat and I was letting her go! I was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. Blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

It took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. It hurts like a bitch. My friend gave me a bunch of Tylenol and it still hurts. I came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *I* do to upset her?! I was so angry I told them I was calling the cops and my dad told me I couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! Is that true??? 

Something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and I'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  Please help me. 

Update: Well shit went down basically how I expected it would. My mom called me very upset that police had came. What happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. I asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her Baker Acted because I was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. Well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and I guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. My mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. She said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved. "
137,137,[Update] Is it arson if I burn down a building that I own?,"Hi everyone, came here to give an update as many people asked.

The burning of the barn finally happened! We went to the fire department and asked about a controlled burn. They said it might be OK under certain conditions but they had to do an inspection first. They made us remove all that could have produced toxic fumes and pollution, like old tires and the ruins of a tractor. The wood was dry and there was almost no paint left so they said it was fine to burn. They were actually glad for the opportunity because they had a new guy to train. They said they would do protection of the other buildings and nearby bush and it would be a productive training session for them.

When the day finally came they let us start the fire (more of a symbol than anything, they did the ""real"" starting for safety reasons). The fire had to be helped a bit because it had rained a lot the days before, but then the whole barn was engulfed at once, it was beautiful in a way. I must say it burned spectacularly well, there was almost nothing left in the end, which is exactly what we wanted. For those of you who were worried about us burning valuable stuff, we did keep some tools and a pile of boards that we will sell but there wasn't much more than that, except if you can find value in porn magazines from the 80s, empty bottles and nude girls calendars. These were my father's possessions so we had a lot of pleasure in letting them burn. We added his clothes for good measure. We likely could have sold more of the barn wood, but there was more purpose for us in burning it all down. Probably won't solve the deeper issues of what our father did but it did bring some relief and some sense of closure.

Unfortunately we couldn't throw the big BBQ party we wanted for the fire department (we did have some beer though) because of Covid restrictions, but we all decided to do it later, hopefully next summer. The firemen were real bros, really cool but professional, and they seemed to have as much fun as we did. We're really thankful for their help, you rock guys."
138,138,the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action [TX],"When I was 14, I was raped by a close family friend. I got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when I was 15. I knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but I did not know their names or what they were like. We received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. I do not remember signing anything.  I do not know what happened to the friend; I asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. My mother said he was jailed but I don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. I  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. My husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200B;

A month ago, I received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. I believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. She told me that she wanted to get to know me. I spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. I found myself disgusted by her. There are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. She is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. I decided that I would not be comfortable meeting her. I blocked her without responding. After a week, I began to receive letters from her. Four letters in total. I did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. I finally answered. I told her that I was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or I would get the police involved.

&#x200B;

She  began to berate me. She told me  that my family was her family. She accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that I had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that I had held back important information. Without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  She told me that she would be making contact with my family whether I liked it or not. She also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if I did not comply and that I could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. When I began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. If I agreed to pay for a round of IVF, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. Here are my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if I tell her to stay away?
2. Could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. My parents are dead and I do not know how to find out information about the adoption. I did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. I am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. Could I be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. I have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. Could I form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if I agreed to pay?

Edit: amount asked for was removed. Also, because several people have asked: I do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. It only stopped once I left the state. I am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and I will need to move again.  "
139,139,My brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. What actions should I take against him?,"Hello. I'm a first-time poster, and I'm also on mobile. I am 19, and I currently live in New York City.

My parents died when my brothers and I were young (Eldest was 11, Second (the brother in question) was 7, and I was 5). They left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. I turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. It was in March 2019 that I finally got it. It turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. I decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. I wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

Yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. I called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after I deposited the money. My savings account has also been taken from. I'll admit, I really should have been paying more attention, but I was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and I got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. We tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. He had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

When I confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. He spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. I know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. It's just line after line of Uber Eats, Postmates, and game purchases. My grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. It would take YEARS for him to make that money back on minimum wage. Should I call the police and have him arrested? Is there any way to get that money back?


Edit: Okay, I've decided to call the police and sue the bank. I know how to get my hands on bank statements, and I'll record him confessing to the theft. But I don't know how to hire a lawyer. Where do I start?

Edit #2: Okay I just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. My grandma sends him to the store with her ATM card sometimes to get money. He memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

Edit #3: Thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. I got a ton of messages and I'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

I've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. We're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. Haven't gotten him arrested yet, but I told her if need be, I would call them myself.

I like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. My mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. She explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. She had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an ATM.

Edit #4: So I went to the bank. Because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. No case to sue the bank with. There's nothing I can do to get the money back. I'm ruined financially. All I can do is sue him and put him in jail, but I'm never gonna see that money again. I'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and I'm sorry if I haven't responded to your messages yet. Also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. This will be the last edit I make, hopefully."
140,140,[US-NC] School nurse refuses treatment over dislike of essential oils,"I felt nauseous after being sick for a few weeks, so I went to the nurse's office. There was only one nurse there, and I was the only student there. I explained my situation, and requested that due to my athsma, she turn off her essential oil diffuser. She refused. Two more students came in, and they explained what problem they had. Both of them said that the essential oils were making it hard to breathe, and she denied that this was even possible. I believe that one of them had athsma. I was having a large amount of difficulty breathing, so I told her that this was a health and safety issue. She got angry and asked me to leave the room. She had not yet attempted to diagnose me. Is there any way I can report her? This is a charter school, meaning that while it is a public school, it is not part of a district."
141,141,[Update] Just found out husband fabricated entire life...,"Edit: This post got more attention than I expected, and awards I didn't even know existed (thanks, kind strangers!). A few notes for the curious among you:

* the best advice I can give for those stuck in an abusive or otherwise horrible relationship is this: (1) no matter what you think now, it will be better if you get out, (2) find people who will give you the kind of advice you'd give someone if roles were reversed, then do what they tell you that you should do, (3) when you're ready to process everything, find a therapist to help you through it, and (4) as well as you can, act in ways that will allow you to look yourself in the eye when it's over, because that will matter and also it will help you in the long run.

* there's a disturbing number of people out there who have lived through things like this and much worse. Please be kind to one another, support those who need it, and refuse to tolerate poor treatment of others.

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/akw5d2/georgia_just_found_out_husband_fabricated_entire/).

It's been a little bit over a year since I turned to this community as my life fell rather dramatically to pieces around me. My original post didn't get a ton of attention, but the replies I received helped me tremendously, and seeing where I am a year later may also provide some hope for those going through their own crisis. In particular, you helped me construct my initial list of immediate-to-do items, and put me on the right track to figure out how to extricate myself from the relationship.

The day I first posted here was the day I found out that my then-husband had lied and fabricated most of what I knew about him. Other things I did that day included teaching a class to 200 undergrads about 15 minutes after I found out for sure, and kicking off a day-and-a-half long job interview for the next stage in my career (a job which I *somehow* landed...).

What unfolded over the following three months can really only be described as living my way through my own version of a Lifetime movie. At some point I moved into an extended stay hotel, and as time passed I learned about the depths and breadths of the lies and deceit he'd used to both control me and get what he wanted, and the lengths he'd go to try and get his grip back on what he'd successfully manipulated his way through for about four years. What I know now -- and what I'm kind of glad I didn't really know then -- was that I wasn't actually as safe with him as I thought I was. So I'm thankful I managed to get out with only psychological/emotional/financial burden, and no physical trauma.

About two-and-a-half months later I successfully had my marriage annulled on the basis of Fraudulent Coercion to Marry. I ended up doing the necessary research and filing the paperwork myself -- which was not an easy task, but was both cheaper and faster than it was going to be if I hired a lawyer. A few weeks after the annulment I moved my belongings out of our apartment and moved to a new city and my new job. Without him, but with the kittens. As of late June I finally had him convinced that contacting me was pointless because he wasn't getting me back, and so I've been largely free to recover from the trauma and crisis mode I lived in for about three months.

One of the things I've learned from all of this is how incredibly difficult it is to get out of a relationship in a situation like this. Besides the obvious difficulty of navigating the legal system, and the cost associated with it, there's the cognitive dissonance of constantly trying to remember to relate to that other person in light of the new information you've found out about them. It really and truly took every life skill and tremendous support of my family and friends network to get out in (more or less) one piece. And even still the road to recovery and a return to thriving is a long one.

So...thanks to those who helped me back on that terrible day in January 2019. And if you know someone who is going through something like this, please offer whatever you can in support. Because they definitely need it!"
142,142,"[UPDATE] [Texas] My Mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. However, the police is still alive, and when I showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. How can I get my cat back?","Link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

Hello,

First off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. I didn’t feel like advice to steal my cat back was ‘legal’ (thus, being in this subreddit), so I took one users advice to talk to the director of Animal Control in my mom’s city.

She basically told me that the police have no idea what they’re doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. She said that the only thing I can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as ‘stolen property’. She said the police will understand what to do if a I reference my cat as ‘property’ and not an animal.

I went to the police station and the police threw me around again. Despite I tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn’t ‘property’. After 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom’s texts. 

The cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, I can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my ‘stolen property’.

We get to my mom’s house and she’s not there. We look around the outside of her house and find no signs of Kitty either. I call her and ask her where she is, and told her that I was at her house with the police. She said, in quote, “I took the cat and ran off into Oklahoma and I’m not ever coming back.” 

The police said they can’t help me since they don’t have jurisdiction in Oklahoma. 

I went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so I left because I can’t afford it. On my way home, I contacted Adult Protective Services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. So I hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

I also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into Oklahoma. My mom played the ‘poor me’ card, so my family bought into it. And somehow, I’m now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... When I got home, I cut everyone out. All of my family. I separated every single tie I had to them.

I’ve had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if I’m being open about the situation, I was a victim of childhood abuse. That cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me I won’t be able to get him back. I ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now I’m getting help for my own mental health. This situation broke me, and right now, I’m trying to recover.

Thank you everyone for listening. 

**Tl;dr:** My cat is gone and I’ll never get him back."
143,143,UPDATE: My Landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. Wtf do i do.,"Because I know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  You all helped break the cycle of panic.

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

I specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""You can't do in-home hospice here"".  


Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :( 

Thanks LA.   "
144,144,Can my parents force a paternity test UPDATE,"Last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can\_my\_parents\_force\_a\_pregnancy\_test/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can_my_parents_force_a_pregnancy_test/)

&#x200B;

I'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200B;

Pretty soon after I posted, I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. I knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so I googled the law firm and lawyer's name. I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200B;

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind. 

&#x200B;

Thanks again for the advice everyone!"
145,145,"[KS] Sister (19F) woke up during a colonoscopy. Sister tried to bring up her upsettedness, doctor told her he ""didn't have a pill to cure being a dramatic young woman"".","Basically what the title says. My mother took my sister to the doctor to drive her after. 

Sister goes in for a colonoscopy. She wakes up during the procedure. She admits she was kicking up a fuss, she was too sedated to actually verbalize her pain so she basically just screamed/cried. She could hear the doctor telling the nurses ""this sometimes happens during the procedure, it's just the body's response. I know it's upsetting but she's not awake and can't feel anything"".

When it's over and my sister is back in her room, my sister told my mom what happened (she was still crying and extremely upset, it was painful but also terrifying to not be understood by the doctors). The doctor came in to tell them how it went, and immediately launched into this speech about ""Yeah sorry she's crying, all young women do this. It's called 'being a teenage girl', we see it all the time here."" My mom says ""Uh she's saying she was awake during the procedure.""

The doctor had this look of shock on his face. He kind of rambles for a while and then jumps into this thing about ""Well her blood pressure was getting too low so we couldn't give her any more sedation."" My mom said ""Alright... But she's in a lot of pain here, is there something we can do about that?"" The doctor literally said ""If I could give you a pill to cure being a young woman, I would. But I can't, so she's all yours mom"" and he left.

The nurse was horrified and said ""You should not be seeing this doctor again"". The nurse apologized a bunch and gave my family a referral to a new doctor.

We're going to file a complaint with our state regarding his comments about not having a pill to cure being a young woman. Is there anything else we should be doing?

Edit: I've gotten some helpful comments, but I want to clarify that while the waking up during a colonoscopy (and yes, she was supposed to be asleep during that time - I do know that they're often performed awake but this one was not supposed to be done that way) is upsetting, we're all mostly upset about the fact that he ignored my sister's pain/discomfort because she was ""a young woman""."
146,146,"Doctor sewed my vagina shut after delivering my baby, can I sue?","This might be a weird story, but I had my first child six weeks and three days ago. During delivery, I tore and had to get stitches. The doctor on call didn't tell me how many stitches I got, where he put them or even what type of tear I had. I had my six weeks check up Monday and when I finally get a room, I realize my doctor didn't have any notes or know anything about my delivery. She had to ask me if I got stitches and if the doctor on call gave me any information about them. I had to tell her I had no idea, I was out of it after delivering my son, I couldn't even hold him. When she finally gets to checking to make sure everything is healed up properly, her face changes and she tells me we have a problem. She  then pulls out a notepad and begins to explain that the way my vagina was stitched caused it to heal in a weird way. She then draws the opening to my vagina and shades out the middle of the hole. To put it in a better perspective, my vagina look like the number 8, but the two holes are smaller and the line in the middle is way thicker. I have two mini holes that not even a pen tip could fit into! She tells me I have to have surgery because the problem isn't going to resolve itself. I already had a traumatic time healing from the birthing process and I now have to go back through what traumatized me to begin with. Would I be able to sue the doctor? I tried researching if this is a common thing (even though I've never heard of it) but nothing pops up other than ""the husband stitch"".

Edit: I forgot to mention my doctor took a picture on my phone so I could better understand what she was trying to tell me after I didn't really understand her drawing. I don't think I can post it, not that I really want to, but if I need to draw exactly what's wrong with it to get a better answer, please let me know!

Edit: I came here to look for advice and most of you have been really nice and helpful, even the comments I haven't gotten a chance to respond too yet, but I also see some comments that are very ignorant to the female anatomy! I had someone go to another post of mine and tell me I should've been looking inside my vagina more than once in 6 weeks and the post was about my antidepressants. I don't know about any other woman but even before I had my baby I didn't just go looking inside myself very often. I've been called a troll and honestly it doesn't bother me that much but if you want to see the picture just ask, I can understand how this would be hard to believe, but I literally stated I have proof! I just want help, I'm going through a hard enough time as is."
147,147,My sisters 9year old friend took nude photos of my sister and distributed them on snapchat to adult men. NSFW,"We are in Pennsylvania. 

My sister(9) had nude and semi nude pictures taken of her by her friend (9). This friend had distributed them to the school students and old men on snapchat. 

We have pictures of the conversations between the girl and the old men. Where they talk about my sisters boobs and vagina. They talk about kissing naked among other things. It makes my mother and I physically sick. This girl has sent out messages to this guy pretending to be my sister. 

The mother of the girl deleted the pictures but as everyone knows once it's on the internet it's out there forever. I know that the police would be able to retrieve the photos. 

We took everything to the state police because we have her friends phone currently that has all of the messages. And the police said ""give the phone back and everything will eventually be erased from the internet."" They aren't willing to persu the GROWN MAN that is in possession of these pictures or the girl who has done all of this. They are sending us to our local police department and I know from experience when I was sexually assaulted that they will say the same thing or victim blame.

Please this cant be what we have to live with. My sister cant just be violated at 9 years old and have no justice. What can we do??"
148,148,[UPDATE] Coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex’s dog euthanized. Can I help prevent this?,"[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Glad to say I’ve got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn’t working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He’s also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn’t shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they’d require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can’t be “bitten” by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don’t allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog’s owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I’d call it a win!

Thank you all for your advice and support!"
149,149,My School is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (GA),"I found this out about two hours ago. My  High school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

In the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; ALL STUDENTS WHO DRIVE TO SCHOOL USING A PERSONAL VEHICLE MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THE KEY OR KEY FOB.

After I read this I thought it was a misprint or a mistake. So I called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

About 30 minutes later I checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. They went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

I personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can I do to stop this?

Edit: Campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

150,150,I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.,"I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

This is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances I worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

I am currently residing in Wisconsin.

I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**Information:**
My very first inkling something was up, is the day I believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when I picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. And they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

After this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

That night I had picked him up, I changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. This is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or “washes his hands” with the baby wipes. This time he was not himself. He was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. As I took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, “No! No no [Friends boyfriends name]!” And began crying hysterically. 

My heart sank. As a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. I know something was done to my baby. 

I looked my friends boyfriend’s criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. This man is dangerous, and I didn’t even know this.

**My Concerns And What Can I do?:**

Notably in Wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does CPS investigate the person reporting? Both myself and the party involve?

Will the investigators / CPS take this matter seriously when regarding my child’s age?

How do I go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

What kind of things will they (either CPS or law enforcement etc) look into?

If reported, and nothing happens, what things can I do to protect my child(ren) And my family? 

For a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs I can keep my eyes open for?

Any advice, any help at all will greatly help. I’m absolutely devastated and need help as I’m at a loss.

**Edit:** I need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why I’m scared for myself and my family.

**Edit 2**: I am currently on my way to my appointment with CPS and Law Enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases I will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, I honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome."
151,151,Door dash added my business to their website without my consent and failed to mention it to me,"I have a small but somewhat successful take away business in Australia that does pick up and delivery. 
For the passed month or so door dash drivers have been coming into my shop and picking up food for customers. We finally picked up on it and I called door dash and to my surprise my menu ( which was incorrect, with food and prices ) were on there. I asked them how this happened and to take me down. 


They told me it was done automatically. They never asked me or informed me. I told them to take me down immediately. They said okay.


About a week passes and I'm still getting door dashers. More and more frequently. I call them again and this time they try to argue with me saying that they are doing me a favour, insisting I stay with them. I explain I am losing money with them because instead of people paying me a delivery fee for my own drivers to deliver the food. They are paying door dash instead.

They tried to plead me to stay. I said no and even now I'm only temporarily removed from their website ( 2 weeks )

152,152,Adopted a dog from a rescue. Now one of the staff is threatening to confiscate my dog if I don't add her on Facebook.,"**Regarding the false sticky edit by a mod: When you adopt a dog from a rescue, the dog is spayed or neutered by the rescue before they go to their forever home, as they absolutely should be. I am not planning to violate my contract by breeding my dog. I don't know who I was reported to be to the mods, but that is 100% incorrect and it's baffling that they would make that accusation without any proof. I am just someone who adopted a dog and am now being bombarded with emails (and texts now too!) from a crazy rescue owner demanding I add her on Facebook. That's it. People can stop with the harassment, threats, and insults now.**

Pretty much the title. My fiance and I adopted a dog from a rescue a couple weeks ago. Then I received a Facebook friend request the evening after doggo came home from the lady who had been fostering him. She also happens to be one of the co-founders of the rescue. I have very few friends on Facebook (literally just 28 people) because I only want to share my life with good friends and family, basically just people I trust, so I didn't accept the request. I didn't actually take any action at all, I just ignored it. A few days later, I received an email from her ""reminding"" me to accept her request and that I need to post a photo of my dog weekly so that she knows the dog is doing well and is still with me. I told her I wasn't comfortable with adding her on Facebook since I didn't really know her, but would be happy to send her periodic updates.

Apparently, this wasn't good enough, and she responded with an incredibly snooty email saying that she requires social media contact in order to be able to assess how the dogs are doing and make sure they are in a good home and that adopters are adhering to the contract. She also said that if I refuse to accept her friend request, she may have to take ""legal action"" and have our dog forcibly removed from our home.

NOWHERE in the contract does it state that I must be Facebook friends with her, and when I asked my friend who recommended this rescue if she had to do this, she said she didn't, but that this person is kind of known to be very involved and protective of the dogs she adopts out. Do I have to actually do this, and can the rescue actually take my dog back if I don't? I'm even more uncomfortable with the idea now knowing how overbearing she is. It's just a boundary thing to me."
153,153,(UT) A deputy showed up at our door yesterday and attempted to arrest my wife only based on her name,"The deputy knocked on the door, my wife answered.  They asked her name, she told them, and they asked her to step outside.  She declined because she wasn't wearing shoes.  He said ""OK, we will do this inside then"", and stepped in the door.  He told her that he was there to arrest her.  She's never even had so much as a parking ticket in her life.  She protested that she had done nothing wrong, and that she had a common name.  Finally they agreed to let her get her ID.  After examining it, they went and looked up the birthday of their suspect and found that they were indeed different, so they left.

I'm upset that this happened.  If she had stepped outside, they would have likely arrested her on the spot, she did not have her phone, and I would have had no idea what had happened to her.  I would like to file whatever complaints I can, and ideally find the judge who signed the warrant to complain how poorly the deputies did in trying to arrest the correct person.  Any advice for the best next steps?"
154,154,"Neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the TWO spaces in front of our home. After asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving ALL their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.","California here, getting that out of the way. And full disclosure, its not my home. The home belongs to my parents, but I house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus I love my parents and want what's best for them). I will just be saying MY home or MY driveway so I dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


These neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with ALL the memories. I thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

My parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. He has it parked in the middle so that it takes up ALL the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. It has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. Why? I don't know. Perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. All I know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

I want to also mention they have a full garage. They also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. And a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

I politely asked him to move his car when I saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. He followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. Several days later I visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

I spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since I had asked him to move his car as payback. They said he's really mean and to just let it go. This did not sit right to me, so I later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. I explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

Bad idea. I assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. I assumed mom would just tell 'Billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. Turns out he got it from mom and dad. I get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how I did NOT just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

I didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. My mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. Apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an FU to my mom and dad. That's also when their car got keyed

So since I made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. Now the parents are retaliating too.They finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. The one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. The beater was moved so its parked on the OTHER side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. Sorry for the run-on sentence. Did that all make sense? I hope so.

This has been going on for a few weeks now.

Is there anything that can be done? My parent's just seem to want to let it go. Not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. My parents travel a lot and my work makes it so I cant always be there to sit the house for them. They fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. I used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. Is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?

She is refusing to pay vet bills this time because “I shouldn’t have been walking my dog around her apartment.” Houston, TX","The first time I let it go because she paid the vet bills and my dog got the care she needed. She is a medium sized, 35lb dog.   
This time, I turned a corner with my dog and her dogs saw mine, overpowered her (walking both at once. About 60-80lb pitbulls) and even though I picked my dog up, they bit her leg and dragged her down before going for her neck. I screamed for help and eventually people came out to help.   

One bystander said I “should avoid that area because I know her dogs live there.” And I guess they convinced that owner that it was MY fault that her dogs attacked my dog.   

My dog has a reputation around the complex for barking and trying to intimidate people, but I keep her in check and hold a short leash because of that. My dog has never attacked anyone or anything and has never gotten out of my control because I know how to handle her. This lady said that “my dog is known to provoke reactions” and is using that to justify why her dogs attacked mine.  

I’ve already called animal control and I am about to file a complaint to the property manager. What else should I do?

156,156,"(NYC) I am being harassed by the orthodox Jewish ""police"" in my home. This has been going on for almost 2 years since I moved in. I am at my wits end, what can I do to stop it?","**edit2: putting this here since this is locked. Thank everyone for all the advice/support. I will be following some of the advice recieved and update once I have one. If this works I’ll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what I’ve been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance I’ll have no choice but to move. Thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. That has been expecially helpful because it’s put my situation into perspective. Yeah it sucks but worst case I can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn’t the case for people within the community. And even though the NYPD has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. Hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i’ve Found myself in for what it is. Will update when I can.**


*Edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home SEVEN times. and this is common.*

I live in Brooklyn NY. I purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by Orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by Orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. I honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

Since i moved in though, this has been a HUGE issue. I don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. I honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. The issue is that they have been using the Jewish police to harass me. 
To give you an idea of the shit I am dealing with I'll tell you what prompted this post.  I chose to have a Superbowl viewing party today. About 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were FIVE people here) I get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. We were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). My condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   Since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people I INVITED from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. I don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that I have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

I am fucking done. I want this to stop. I have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. I have tried calling the NYPD every time they show up. This has not worked. I have complained to my condo association. No help. I have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city AND state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and NOTHING has worked. I keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home THAT I OWN WITH MY PERMISSION. 

Im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. I am just so fed up with this bullshit. I am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a HOME I OWN on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

am i crazy here? how is this allowed? what can i do to stop it? "
157,157,I (27F) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work,"Hello,

As the post says I am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **Virginia**. I work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. When I was hired I wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. I think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that I'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. I have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. So then I had to buy a wireless mouse. I have a nice computer and I hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200B;

Today I have strep. Strep as an adult is terrible. I told my boss I could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. That night on the phone she said yes please work from home. First thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. She said OK, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since I wouldn't install the timer and that I was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

&#x200B;

This is on top of the fact that I have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. Yes, I have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. During the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

&#x200B;

So listen, I know I need a new job but- is this legal? How do I approach this? I am now going to have to use sick/vacation time that I wasn't planning on using. I think I should be paid for my time today.

Thanks for the help!

She ended up taking me to court. Her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before I even met her, and she married me knowing it). Her lawyer claimed otherwise, that I had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. This was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as I had email communications with her acknowledging my record. She insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. Perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. Her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

She dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

Her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. He was a decent guy. Ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. It's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

I'm talking to my lawyer to change the custody agreement too.  "
159,159,My (29F) Husband (32M) served me with divorce papers last night and has been cheating on me our whole 10 year relationship.,"Hi everyone.. using a throwaway account because I know some of my friends follow here and know my username. 

So basically, like the title says: my husband has been cheating on me for our whole relationship of 10+years and served me with divorce papers..during quarantine. He wants me out of the apartment by next Friday but I am too embarrassed to tell my family. In my culture, no one gets a divorce and I don’t know where to start. 

I know I need to get a lawyer but I’m completely confused and blindsided right now and would like advice before contacting a lawyer so I don’t look as clueless as I am. He’s being completely irrational and doesn’t want me to have anything. Not the furniture in the house, the food in the fridge, or our dog. I’m hoping someone can help me out with the most important things below: 

First, We don’t have a prenup. I met him when i was 19 and he had opened up his first restaurant in the city, I really thought we’d grow old together. I know, stupid of me not to cover my ass but i was with him for so long that i got really comfortable and couldn’t imagine him doing this. We bought a condo in New York and most of it was paid for by me and my family but it is in his name. I’m scared of losing the house since my parents and I put so much into it. But, I also can’t afford to keep the house on my own for more than a few months unless I ask my parents for help which I’m also embarrassed to ask for. Can his infidelity help me out here? 

Second, he bought me a car for my birthday just last year and is telling me i have to leave the car with him- so i have no way of moving any of my stuff out and would put myself at great risk of getting covid-19. Is he allowed to do this?

Third, I am a co-signer on two of the small loans that he has on his restaurants. I’m also invested in them and they’re a great second source of income, even in these times. How will the judge (or whoever ultimately makes the decision) determine whether or not I can maybe keep one of the restaurants or still collect revenue from them? Again, no prenup and my husband was unfaithful. 

I’d love to hear your advice. Any bit helps right now."
160,160,My family is abusive and I want to emancipate myself,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My maternal grandfather also stays with us. My parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - I was in the car but I survived - and I was taken in by my maternal aunt. My dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

The last two years have been hell for me. Not only because I still can't get over losing my parents (I cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. My mom was actually estranged from her family. She was white, and my dad was black. Her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. They have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and I guess I'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

They have told me just that on several occasions. That my existence is a mistake. I get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. And I'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Sometimes it gets physical. Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a minefield. I have to be so careful about where I step cause the repercussions may be explosive. My ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. He has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

I can't live like this anymore. I'm an absolute emotional mess. I wanna emancipate myself but I don't know how to go about it. I know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 I'm close with a set of twins at school - I'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. Their parents own a farm and I work regularly with the family. I'm also into photography and I've been doing real good with shooting weddings. They are very lucrative and I've saved up a substantial amount. With summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but I also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

The parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. I've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. I don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

I would really appreciate advice.

Thank you

165,165,Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp,"My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I’ve done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. My front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn’t very visible from the street. I painted it to match the house as well.

Few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife’s never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which I chalked up to her being shy or whatever. However, recently I got a note taped up to my door that said she’s going to sue if I don’t take the ramp down, as it’s an eyesore and “reduces curbside value.” I have no idea what she means since you can’t see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

She refused to answer the door when I went over to talk to her about it. I’m trying not to lose my temper over this but it’s hard. There’s been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called “handicap accessible” places, I don’t want my home to be one of them. Does she have any sort of case? I’m in Washington."
166,166,[UPDATE] Local businessowner attacks women with power drill to groin. How is this not a crime?,"Idk if anyone would care about this, but I wanted to post an update anyways because it's good news. Original post was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9stxzx/a_local_business_owner_attacked_a_woman_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This happened in Wisconsin.  

Basically, almost 2 years ago, my family member was attacked with a power drill by a bar owner. He was trying to flirt with her (she was not interested) and then ""jokingly"" thrust a running power drill into her genital area. She pushed his hand away, and so he drilled through her jeans into her inner thigh instead. Instead of immediately stopping, he continued drilling and the drill bit penetrated her jeans, penetrated her skin, and also burned her badly enough to require treatment from the burn clinic, and caused nerve damage. She got an infection from the wound as well.  (Pics are on the old post)  The nurses at the hopsital had encouraged her to report the incident to police, and she did the next day, especially because there were *numerous* witnesses present for this entire incident who were horrified and wanted to make a statement.  

The police officer who responded seemed indifferent and even hostile towards her reporting this right off the bat, and he refused to see the wound or even a picture of it. He wasn't willing to speak to any witnesses. He did go and speak with the bar owner, who admitted to doing all of this, and claimed it was ""an accident"", and that he would pay her medical bills. (Spoiler alert: He did not.)  The officer deemed this answer satisfactory, and went back to tell my cousin that ""because alcohol was involved"" (owner was sober, she had 1 drink, no one was intoxicated?), that nothing could be done and that she was banned from the bar for life. That was the end of that, or so we thought....   

Now for the update:  Out of the blue in early 2020, my cousin gets a phone call from an FBI agent. I don't know how this works, but apparently our local PD has an FBI agent who comes in a couple days a week and works on or reviews stuff? Anyways, the bar owner was being investigated for separate, unrelated sex crimes, and the FBI agent came across the report my cousin had made against him. She asked my cousin what had happened, and she told her. The agent was shocked and appalled, she said because NONE OF THAT was in the officers police report. Nothing whatsoever about this guy taking a power drill to her groin. She told the FBI lady that she had very thorough documentation, pictures, and medical records from this incident, as well as a dozen witnesses, and the agent had her send it all to her and set up a meeting the following week to discuss.    

When they sat down the following week, she told her that what had happened to her was most definitely a crime, possibly even a sex crime. The witnesses confirmed her account, and were willing to testify in court. The officer who had blown her off was reprimanded and disciplined for his inaction, and tried to defend himself by claiming, ""I didn't know her wound was that bad"", to which the FBI agent asked him, ""Why did you refuse to look at her wound or pictures of it?"" Anyways, the FBI lady took this case to the district attorney, who agreed to file charges.  

The bar owner has since been arrested and charged with the following:  

2nd Degree Reckless Injury - Felony.    

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

Disorderly Conduct- Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.  

Stalking - Felony.  

His tavern license was revoked, his bar was shut down, and has since been sold. The case is delayed due to COVID, but they did arrest and charge him finally. This guy also sexually assaulted other women, both before and after this incident (he has prior disorderly conduct convictions and many restraining orders from women against him). These other charges include ""allegedly"" cornering a female bartender and demanding she give him oral sex--at which point she just ran screaming out of the place. He also violently cornered and groped another female bartender, and then stalked her mercilessly, smashed out her windows, slashed her tires, etc., until he was finally caught on video stalking her.   

It never sat well with me that the police blew this off, especially knowing his prior history, and hearing stories about him abusing other women. Obviously, this guy was escalating, probably because he never faced consequences for his actions before.  I'm glad to say he will finally face justice for his crimes, thanks to the actions of this FBI agent."
167,167,"My neighbors received a typed letter in a handwritten envelope through the post. The letter claimed that my wife and I are growing drugs, long time drug users and host bisexual swinger parties. My employer lives on my street and surely received this letter...

Fortunately, one of my neighbors shared the typed letter and hand written envelope with me. Other neighbors called my wife to tell her.

I plan to file a police report today after work.

What else should i do?  My wife is a real estate agent and the head of my company's local office is one of my neighbors.  This is all lies but could hurt both of our careers and we have a teenage daughter (she saw the letter).

Wow front page! I want to just thank everyone who's been extremely positive and encouraging and providing great advice in the comments and direct messages. I have some good avenues to explore but likely I think the culprit might be an ex-employee of mine or a neighbor with mental illness. With that said, the neighborhood has been rallying behind us. My wife and I have received multiple phone calls from neighbors expressing support.  We've collected everyone's letter and envelope on our street (except for one because they're on vacation) for when we file our police report.   I have a copy of letter that I wish I could share but this sub does not allow images but I did try and Google the wording and it seems unique for those of you that are asking if it's a template.  I will definitely be careful and cautious in the future and keep my home security cameras on just in case."
168,168,My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"".

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but I didn't know what else to do. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn't even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

Thanks in advance :)

EDIT:  He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like I'm gonna propose"" (that one was last April)

169,169,Bank gave away my entire banking account,"So last week, a check I wrote bounced from an account I have that I rarely use. It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case. 

Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.

So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?"
170,170,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP."

I’m 28, I would have been 13 and 17 at those times...    
how can something like this happen? I have never been arrested for a dui or anything similar in my life but there they are, two cases on my record.   

I don’t even know where to start

After some digging, I discovered that said DUIs (and license suspensions!) were attributed to a guy who lives in a different part of Minnesota and has the exact same name as me and someone inadvertently merged our records.

173,173,"Girlfriend's work ""lost"" her sexual harassment report, then tells her it's over and she's also being written up for work deficiencies.","This happened in California.

My girlfriend recently filed a sexual harassment report with her company after repeated inappropriate conversations, unwanted pictures, touching and hugging and all around creepy behavior that makes her uncomfortable by some of the males at her job. Upon asking one of her supervisors how to submit the report she and another girl who had similar issues were immediately taken to HR. She filed the report and chose to remain anonymous on all the HR paperwork. A few days down the road she is told by HR that both reports have gone missing and they think it was another supervisor that has misplaced it. This supervisor is a different one than the one that had taken her to HR and in my opinion, should have had nothing to do with handling her reports. After being told that HR lost the report, the HR lady then goes on to say that she will talk to the specific guys at work and will tell them specifically that they aren't allowed to retaliate against my girlfriend. Even though it was against her wishes to disclose her name to everyone, the HR lady seemed to be going to do it anyway.

It's now about a week later after everyone has been particularly bitter and mean to her throughout the week for no apparent reason. The head supervisor for her department comes down and says they need to talk. In the meeting is my girlfriend, the head supervisor, another supervisor, and HR. The head supervisor is the only one that talks and starts off with ""That (NAME REMOVED) crap is done and cleared, it's over now"" then continues into how my girlfriends work ethic, conduct, and paperwork has all been messed up since she got there and that they were going to write her up. She has never received any negative paperwork from the company and has only gotten an ass-chewing when she was late due to circumstances out of her control. The supervisor is pointing out things that have never been brought to her attention as to being erroneous and is now using it as a tool to write her up.

Naturally, she feels confused and angry about the whole situation. From other supervisors having hands on her report to losing her report and getting written up for bullshit. Part of the things she was being written up for she had nothing to do with.

What are her options here?  From what I've been able to find, she can submit a complaint through the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

Any help is appreciated.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

First off. Thank you for the support, she will be contacting a lawyer to get their opinion on it and to pursue the next course of action.

She has voice recordings of the inappropriate things these guys were saying and asking her as well as an email she sent to HR asking the lady to not reveal her identity.

What would be the hard documentation she would need in order to fight this? Her employers have already disappeared the report so it's her word against theirs whether or not she filed one."
174,174,[Update] Husband is physically abusive. He is a cop. I can't escape. Help?,"[previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/tp9en2/husband_is_physically_abusive_he_is_a_cop_i_cant/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Hello all,

First of all... I am alive!

Second of all... thank you all so much. 

In my first post I was really really scared because I thought my husband might kill me.

I'm glad to say I made it out.

After the threat I got new motivation and energy to go out. I made a little emergency bag and hid it in the laundry room under the dirty pile.

I started keeping petty cash from my shopping trips.

With the petty cash I bought a very cheap pre paid phone that I used to call a woman's shelter.
They helped me make a plan and got me out of there. 

That was by far the scariest night of my life. I left when I knew my husband had night shift. I was so scared that he somehow found out what I was planning and was hiding out to catch me.

I had been very careful too. I was sweet to him. Acted as if he had broken me successfully. Acted on his every wish. It was very painful.

But that night at 3 am I finally escaped with my little bag. I left behind my phone. That same day I had sold my laptop. I told my husband that I wanted to put some cash forward to his gaming PC so he wouldn't mind. 

I got an old tablet with Sim function for very cheap too. So that I had the rest of the 500 bucks of my laptop sale for me.

I left the car behind and everything left the house and just ran till I arrived at a McDonald's and from there ordered an Uber to the pick up place. 

As soon as I arrived they helped me close everything that could be closed (email, cashapp, my bank account etc etc). And they helped me get an amazing lawyer.

So right now I am in the shelter alive and well. I finally managed to get a TRO till the divorce hearing. My lawyer is realistic with the case.

But everything that matters is that I am no longer scared of going to sleep at night and never waking up.


Thank you so much!"

In Indiana

I'm in grad school, but still go to the same OBGYN in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. I was planning to switch once I finished school and settled down. I have him listed as my emergency contact. 

For some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. Things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(My father and I have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. I will also be switching docs ASAP)

This has to be a HIPAA violation, right? I can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. This could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse. 

tl;dr obgyn keeps calling emergency contact for appointment confirmation instead of my personal number. Worried it could get someone in a more vulnerable than me hurt"
176,176,[NC] My dog went missing a month ago and i found her on Facebook. The family that has her refuses to return her to me. What can I do?,"So a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. At first I thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. I made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

Last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. It was my dog. I should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

I called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. I told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation I all but confirmed it. Here's the problem, when I asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. Stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because I took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". I told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

I found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. I found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. She is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

I'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. That dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. What can I do? I have all of the papers that prove I own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. I also have that police report. What do I need to do to get my dog back?"
177,177,Creepy neighbor thinks he’s my new bf,"I am a mid 20s female. I bought a house with my ex-boyfriend out in the sticks of Kentucky about a year ago. Not terribly long ago, he cheated on me and abandoned our home to be with his new girlfriend. So, I own this property and live here by myself. One of the people that lives at the house (multi-generation home) across the pond is a 21 year old male. He has been watching my house and saw that my ex isn’t here much anymore. So he comes down about 4 days ago and we’re having a regular old friendly neighbor conversation about the Guinea Keets I was getting for him. Then he gets creepy.


I made the mistake of telling him my ex and I broke up, and he instantly started asking very personal questions. He asked to take me to the movies, if he could come over and watch a movie, to go fishing, to go shooting, to hang out. I said “no” to all of these, explaining first, that I am not interested in dating or hanging out, that he’s my damn neighbor and that’s weird and that I’m “seeing people”. 


He continues to insist. I tell him flat out “no” and that I can be his neighbor and that’s it; make an excuse to go inside. I go to a friend’s house for a few days and notice he drives past my house 10+ times in a 2 hour span on my security camera, every night.


I keep my doors closed and locked. Yesterday he decides that no mean yes and comes to my door asking to come inside, that he just wants to talk about the guineas and that he has a Rambo dvd for us to watch. I only have the door cracked a bit and tell him 5+ times that I am in the middle of something, that I’m busy and that he needs to leave. I’m pissed, so the final time he tries to insist, I slam the door on him and lock it. 


Any legal advice for this? What would you do? So far, I know I am going to be video recording any interactions he attempts with me from now on and keeping my gun loaded/close by, but I know trespassing is a sticky law, even in KY. I don’t have no trespassing signs up at the moment. I am also putting my house on the market this Saturday because I’m just done and want a fresh start considering everything that’s going on in my life rn, but I will be at the house a lot while it’s on the market."
178,178,"Boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, I was not raped.","I am in Boston BUT my abortion happened in New York City. I was 18 and this was completely legal. 

I’m 18 and in college. Like all 18 year olds, I mess up. I messed up big time and I ended up pregnant. I waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, I went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and I took a couples’ trip to NYC so I could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

We got back to Boston and life went on. I am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, I’m not considered depressed, I have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. I receive my therapy in a non religious environment. This is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before I went to college, my parents are toxic, and I needed help with that burden. 

I told my therapist immediately that I’d had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, I go to a university that I worked my ass off to get into and I’ll be damned if I let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. I also could not raise a child that I disdained. Selfish? Yes. But I’m not sorry). I also informed her that my boyfriend and I are still together and that he and I plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. He and I split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

I go home and do homework. At around 4 pm, I get a visit from the Boston Police who are investigating a rape. They think that I’m the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that I’ve been forced to have an abortion, I ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and I agreed that abortion was the way to go. After a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

Then I get a call from my parents. They’re ranting on and on about how I’ve gotten an abortion and sinned in God’s eyes, how I’ve been fornicating and screwed every man in NYC, and how my lack of contact (I’m NC with them because of abuse and they’re narcissists) is killing my mother. They screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they’ve been given my address in Boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

It becomes clear. My therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (I never gave her their number, address, or personal information. She did not know their names, I only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that I’d been raped and gotten an abortion. 

I never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. I never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when I mentioned the sex, I called it “consensual sex”. The police are still hounding me, I’m freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by CONTINUING to knowingly provide false information to the police (although I gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that I have Stockholm Syndrome and that’s why I won’t report my boyfriend, and I’m at a loss for what to do. 

I also know why she’s having some weird witch hunt. My boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, I was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). I was not and in the session I said specifically told her that I never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that I was raped at his fraternity house. 

I’ve also started to get calls from the NYPD investigating the “forced abortion” and I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. This is serious. 

At this point in time I know that I need to get the police off my butt. Is there a way that would help me? Is a lawyer the best way to go? Also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? Is there a way to make sure she doesn’t do this again? 


Edit: when the cops came the first time, I told them that she was completely falsifying everything and I gave them evidence. She is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so I’m not taken seriously. The last time the cops called was last night. "

She has stated herself that if she were to put the kid in school they'd have to start 2 grades behind. There are other things in their life that support this.

181,181,My rapist sent me an Instagram DM confessing to raping me 7 years later. The prosecutor still refuses to press charges. What can I do?,"For the sake of anonymity, i am going to keep this long story short. I was raped in college by a man i did not know and did not ever express interest in. He followed me home from a bar and snuck into my building and waited until my male friend who walked me home that night (to get away from him) left my building to come bang on my door. At the time I was an 18 yr old white female and this was a smallish college town in the south. 

I had a lot more evidence than typical campus rape cases (witnesses/text messages/rape kit) and this was not the type of guy that made one horrible mistake - if nothing happened i knew he would 10000% do it to another girl which is why i felt it was my responsibility to try to do something. 

By the time the DA finally officially told me they weren’t going to do anything 2 years later, because “it’s difficult to prosecute when alcohol is involved”, it was too late for me to pursue a civil suit. It might be worth noting that the man comes from money, and a lot of it.  I also found out they never analyzed my rape kit, let alone investigated the crime scene. There were few other things that were pretty sketchy about the police investigation /DAs handling of the case, but I can’t get too specific on here. It kind of felt like they were doing everything in their power to not prosecute, and there’s literally nothing on his record to show for it, not even a dropped charge.

It took me a long time to truly move on and accept that I did what I could, but i finally did. And then a week or so ago, 6 1/2 years later, I realized I had unread message requests on Instagram from a month prior and saw I had something from him (we were not Instagram friends). There were various messages in a row that clearly demonstrate he is not well mentally, but more importantly at the end he said “so I guess i raped you.  I won’t do it to anyone else ever”. I was shook. 

I sent it to the DAs office, who were utterly shocked and the next day said they’d get back to me in another week but that I “shouldn’t get my hopes up because this kind of stuff is really complicated and difficult to prosecute”. While they haven’t told me officially yet that they aren’t going to prosecute, I know in my gut it’s not going to happen. They’ll find an excuse. 

So i know i need a lawyer so please don’t give that to me as advice. I am posting this question to see if anyone’s ever been through anything similar and knows of nonprofits/resources/pro bono lawyers that might be able to help. I can’t sue him (statute limitations) and I can’t really sue the government (uphill battle), but I also can’t just let this go again. If there’s anything I’ve learned recently It’s that things/systems don’t change by staying quiet. 

What can i do to both get a mark on his record and shed light on the justice system that failed me and I’m sure many others?

Edit - I received so much helpful advice, referrals, and positive comments and I can’t thank you all enough. I now have a lawyer who specializes in these kind of cases, and is going to try to help me push the criminal case through the legal system. If that doesn’t work, plan B will be to publish my experience on media/social media. Thanks again!"
182,182,[IL] Neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). Landlord hasn’t done anything,"I rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex’s parking lot is included in my rent. I have a parking pass that I display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

I have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. I have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. I have also kept a log of every time I notice this neighbor in my spot & when I’ve contacted my landlord. (For what it’s worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he’s gone to reserve it, so I don’t think this is just confusion - I don’t think he owns a spot at all).

This past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. I confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. I once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, I shouldn’t have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

Well, apparently neighbor didn’t listen, because last night he was in my spot again. I called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn’t come or were talked out of it by him, because when I woke up this morning, his car was still there.

Additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an HOA, & my landlord always claims he’ll “notify them” when I make a complaint about my neighbor. 

I’m growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as I pay for this spot. With that being said, I’d appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. What can I do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. What actions can I take to ensure my neighbor doesn’t get me towed from a spot that I am authorized to use?

Update edit: I just spoke with the HOA. They confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn’t even have a parking spot at all. HOA also said he should’ve never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won’t happen again. Finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that I can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot. "

Her daughter is smart enough but constantly reverting to acting like a toddler; she's doing it more than she acts her age. I support extended breast feeding but this is getting weird. We work at a health food store; we are talking major crunchy granola.  So, once she let it slip that they all sleep naked in bed together. I honestly do not think they are pedophiles at all, but as liberal as I am, that's still getting weird at her age.  I've always minded my own business, but now she's saying she's going to pull the girl out of the public school because the classroom teacher is starting to question the emotional development of the child. Do I mind my own business or make a discreet phone call to CPS?  No way in Hell would I discuss the matter with her; she's on one hell of an ego trip.  Could I do this anonymously? I can't risk CPS telling her it was me. One last detail: another coworker's daughter spent the night at their house and they had both girls running around naked, which would not have been cool with the girl's conservative mom, but the adults were not naked in front of the girls. # Free Spirit!"

I never saw the ad, but I remember my sister telling me about it at the time. She was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. So she began a correspondence with ""Aileen"". I did not live with my sister, I'm older by 5 years so I was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

So she ends up going to this place last August, I think, maybe early September. I have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. I was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""Aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. That right there was the first time I thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so I didn't push it.

Over time, the tone of her emails changed. She would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""Aileen"" much. Then it gradually became that ""Aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""Aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""Aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""Aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""Aileen"" made her take drugs. Seriously disturbing stuff. I told her she needed to get out of there, that I'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""Aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

I didn't know what to do at that point. I thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and I trusted her judgment at the time. It's not like I had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, I didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""Aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. Yes, I was tentatively concerned, is what I'm trying to say, but I felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

My sister emailed me yesterday and I don't feel like that is the case anymore. Something had happened and from what I was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""Aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. My sister was forced to participate in this. She seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. I don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

I stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but I couldn't figure anything out. I know my sister took a Greyhound to Lansing and Aileen picked her up from the bus station, so I think this freak show is probably in either Eaton, or Ingham but as to more specifics, I have no idea. I don't think my sister even knows. I have a hunch they're in, or around Mason because Aileen made the kids spend the night at Seven Gables, but other than that I'm coming up empty.

I know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but I really need to know what to do. How do I handle this situation?  

Good update: I did what a lot of people suggested with the IP address. I would have never thought of it, I'm not very tech savvy. She is in Mason or at least uses that library. I'm going to contact the police there. You guys are rockstars."

189,189,"Have been sick for 18 months. Found out through a 2nd Dr. opinion, the day before Christmas, that that my first hospital/doctor likely misdiagnosed my condition. New doctor says says surgery is now no longer an option, and was told to get my affairs in order. What can I do?","It’s three in the morning here. Haven’t slept much in 4 days. Apologies if I’m unable to separate my emotions with objectivity. 

I’m (44M) a husband to my wife (40F) and a father to two children under 18. 

In June of 2018 I began having small seizures and went to see my PCP who referred me to my hospitals Nerology clinic. The clinic ran bloodwork, did a spinal MRI, and a 60 minute EEG. Concluded that my seizures were psychogenic. For the next year+ the seizers grew worse. I went back to the neurology clinic a dozen more times.. my wife and I practically begging for some... any... additional testing to get to the bottom of the seizures. Well documented. 

Fed up, in early December of this year I went to see another neurologist / hospital for a second opinion. I’ve was in the hospital for weeks where they ran much more extensive testing including a complete brain / spinal MRI, brain CT, Lumbar Puncture, and other more exhaustive EEG tests. 

On December 23rd, my last day in the hospital, my “second opinion” neurologist and neurosurgeon told my wife and I that I have an tumor that likely spread from a misdiagnosed growth in my right front parietal lobe... which has spread to the base of my brain stem. The right frontal tumor is operable, but the cancer in the base of my brain stem is not. 

The 2nd doctor(s) dont seem to want to throw the other hospital under the bus, but it’s obvious (at least to my wife and I) that they think my first doctors made some pretty bad mistakes in missing some fairly obvious signs and failing to run some basic tests,

I’m sick to my stomach. I think partly because I’m scared out of my mind for both me and my family, but also at the thought that this could have been avoided. It’s likely I won’t have the strength to find out if, or how, the first hospital messed up.. I’m not sure I’ll even be around to find out let alone ask the questions.

No one thinks I should worry and stress about what “could have been done”, and to focus my energy on getting “well” whole getting my affairs in order. 

I can’t help but rage at my first doctors for, what it feels and sounds like, is a major fuck up.

Assuming that the first hospital made a mistake, where do I even start to get the legal help I need to unwind the last 18 months? What happens if I’m not around to get to the bottom of the possible mistakes the first hospital made?

Edit - Located in California as are both hospitals."

The whole situation looks like ""a  clusterf... of massive proportions"" in their opinion, and they haven't gotten to the bottom of it in any way.

It happened February 3rd, 2018. The attack was classified as a level one trauma. I arrived to the dog park before noon with my two dogs. The dog was being aggressive towards my dog, a puppy. Before this they were dry humping each other. I went to lift my dog to prevent a situation but the pit bull turned on me. The last thing i remember is it *****. I remember me being on the ground covered in dirt and mauled for like three entire minutes. He locked on two of my limbs. Ripped my face apart, and left my dog for dead.I tried so hard to defend him and myself but this dog overpowered the both of us. I was rushed to the emergency room,  given an immediate mike of fentanyl for the road but even that couldn’t calm the pain. Which is really the only thing I can remember for the aftermath part. I almost went into cardiac arrest from rate my heart was pumping is what a nurse told me. i wasn’t aware of the extent of my injuries but i couldn’t see from my left eye.

192,192,My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I’ve been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street.,"NYC. I’m sorry if the text is one big block, I’m on mobile. I don’t really know what to say, I’m baffled. I’ve been living with a new room mate for about 3 months. Two weeks ago, my room mate accused me of stealing 3700$ out of his bedroom and swears up and down that it was me because he has “footage”. He also filed a restraining order. According to the police report, this theft occurred between the hours of 4 am to 5 am of August 22, 2019. However, during this time I was about an hour away from home and have receipts to prove it. I went to a 24 hour CVS and a bank that places me somewhere else. Not only that but I was at the airport at 6 am going on vacation. This was not me. I didn’t get word of what was going on until 3 days into my vacation and was told I was wanted for grand larceny and fleeing the country. As soon as I came back to New York on the 28th, I called the detective and set up a meeting. When I did meet with him, I showed him the receipts and provided him with my license plate to prove that I was not in the neighborhood the day of. He very much nonchalantly brushed me off and let me know he’ll “get around” to my case because he has more important cases to take care of. However this is literally ruining my life. I have not been home since coming back and I’ve been staying with a friend. My room mate is literally squatting in the apartment and ransacking my room.

193,193,[UPDATE] I have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! And my landlord’s response was: “If you don’t like it- just move out!”,"[Here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

I have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400CAD a month) in my apartment in Ontario, Canada.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the advice I received from the original post – here’s what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200B;

**I managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* I noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month I was consistently consuming around 2600 kWh. No matter the month – no matter if I was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* I also checked the specific weeks where I was on vacation. I was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- I paid around $70 for each week I was away. A total of $140 I paid when I wasn’t even home for two weeks!
* Furiously, I called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit Is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* She also Informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**The inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* I was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* The Inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* The closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! Feeding hot water to all the units.
* To prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! Meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* Also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

After emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. We noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). After he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. I had to shower at the neighbor’s house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200B;

**Yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to “see what’s going on.”** *My boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* Instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. He is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* My boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and FIX this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven’t already done enough).
* The landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said “**If you don’t like it- just move out!”**

**I am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* Due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* Since my boyfriend and I are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with NO hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**My question to all of you:**

1. What do I do now?... Can I trust my landlord to ‘solve’ this issue on his own – even though his “plumbers” will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. What happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. Do I need a lawyer?

Thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200B;

***EDIT!***

* Thank's to all of you who commented last night! - Unfortunately the comments got locked before I could even reply to any of you! 
* I am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on Monday!

194,194,(UPDATE} A clothing company I used to work for is sending me a cease and desist letter for using designs they rejected.,"[Orignal post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e7ohlh/a_clothing_company_i_used_to_work_for_is_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I brought this up to a lawyer and they laughed. I made the designs before I started there on my own computer on my own time. They had no legal claim to them, and they were just trying to bully/strong arm a 19 year old designer. 

My lawyer sent back some type of legal letter and they immediately apologized and said that any designs I didn’t specifically make for customers were mine and mine only. My lawyer said something along the lines of “they can’t afford this type of suit.” as they are a mom and pop type company. Lawyer did it free of charge. 

All worked out in my favor!"
195,195,(Update) Bought a PS4 from Walmart for Christmas and it had books in it,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

Ever since discovering right before Christmas that the PS4 Spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

I took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""We stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

Corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. So I've been back to the same Walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. I wasn't yelling, or causing issues I just want the PS4 my wife purchased for our son for Christmas. 

So the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""I believe this man has been trying to scam us since Christmas Eve claiming his PS4 had books in the box"". Cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that I've been constantly dealing with and I get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

I again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

So the outcome? No PS4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and I cannot do a chargeback. If you are ever purchasing anything expensive from Walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. Merry Christmas Walmart.

196,196,"[WA] My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. Is there anything I can do?","Hi, so my life is falling apart.

As the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. They have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. I love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and I would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

She has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. I don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. The reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but I know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. As a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

I was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. I opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. I told him that if he did end up having custody I would want to be seeing her as often as possible as I consider her my family. He told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. I don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that I am too as a result. I slammed the door. I was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

So basically, I have a few questions:First, Can anything be done to stop him having custody? There are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research I have completed.

Third, at the very least, could I contend in a court that I have visiting rights to her? I'm not actually related to her, so I'm not sure what the standing is there.

Third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway I can straight up adopt my step sister? I have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, I have an apartment of my own, and I would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**EDIT: I want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

Thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. I'm at my wits end and I will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and I don't care about the cost."
197,197,"UPDATE - [NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago.

So after talking to a lawyer, he wrote a strongly worded letter to my supplier basically outlining that they are responsible for losses incurred during shipping (FOB Shipping). My supplier has changed their tune drastically after that letter and refunded me. Unfortunately they have decided to no longer do business with me anymore, which hurts a lot. 

UPS however is still a complete and utter mess, but someone told me to send it to a local UPS store via ups my choice, which actually worked for some packages while others seem to be stuck in internal limbo and are just not moving. 

Anyways with my lease renewal coming up i have more or less just decided to start winding down operations in the coming months and plan to close my store by the end of the year. This isn't happy ending, but between COVID / this screw up / having issues getting products my customers want i simply would rather just wind things down rather then trying to keep something going that isn't profitable. 

Thank you for your advice and help though."
198,198,Update: My ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (Florida),"**EDIT:** Forgot to add this...My first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update."
199,199,"When I was hired I was given a key and told if I lose it I owe $15,000. I lost it. Do I have to pay up?","I am located in Michigan.  

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss’ boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the “money I owe.”   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me “you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we’ll worry about that later.”   I replied with “to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven’t signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?”  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn’t forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of “verbal contract?” At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I’m not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. I can not afford this “charge.”

201,201,good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some. The next morning I found all my tires had been slashed. Screw him, I don't feel bad any more.

The rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise I don't know nearly enough about what I'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. A lot of the decisions I've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because I knew it would but because I had no idea what I was doing and left it up to him. I've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what I have. Thanks for all your comments."

They also interviewed me to check that he was safe with me and seemed to conclude that he is even though they didn't tell me very clearly. They couldn't/didn't want to tell me whether they would recommend he stay with me or go back home however. We were also advised to call law enforcement, which we did. I also called our parents to let them know. My parents showed up at my place the next day and demanded to talk to my brother without me present. I let them in but I stayed there the whole time. My brother didn't budge and said he would stay with me no matter what and wouldn't go to the camp. Things got very tensed and there was a lot of yelling and ranting and nasty things were said to my brother. That's when I said  they were no longer welcome at my place and I would call the police if they didn't go away, and they left.

They came back that night to tell us that my brother can stay but he and I are disowned, they won't do anything for any of us now, they won't take him back and we're both dead to them. Then they drove back home. In a way convincing them to let my brother stay with me, at least temporarily, was easier than I had anticipated. The price to pay with our family is high but there was never going to be an easy solution. I was afraid of a big fight and they would call the police and accuse me of kidnapping  but thankfully that didn't happen. Good thing is my brother isn't going back to our parents, and our lawyer thinks that there's a good chance DCFS will allow him to stay with me. Complicated thing is that I hadn't planned to be taking care of a teenager any time soon so this is all new to me and frankly a bit overwhelming.  We're going to work with our lawyer to establish guardianship if that can be done. My bro and I are relieved that he (likely) can stay here and he's safe but there are tons of issues we still have to deal with like transferring schools, and above all helping him adapt to a new life in a new environment. A lot of work ahead of us for sure..."
203,203,I found my 30 year old fiancé talking to 13 and 14 year old children. What is my next step?,"I apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but I am pursuing the legal route instead

I found messages on my fiancé’s Snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. I took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before I left him. Upon talking to them I discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. The 14 year old claims that my fiancé was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. I have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. She also had one of my fiancé’s best friends added to her Snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

We also have a one year old daughter who I am going to protect from him at any cost. What can I do to ensure this?

I have not contacted the police yet. I am not sure if a crime has been actually committed as I’m unfamiliar with the law. I just need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row and what my next step should be."
204,204,"[PA/NY] Adopted out biological child has severe special needs, adoptive parents pushing us to help.","My now husband and I legally gave our first child up for adoption 10 years ago to some relatives. We now are married and have a child together. Our biological child has severe autism. He is nonverbal and cannot be toilet trained, among other things. 

The adoptive parents obviously know who we are because we are distant relatives. This was supposed to be a semi-open adoption, but we have only seen this child twice at family functions since his birth. Since December, they've started sending out messages and phone calls that make it clear that they believe this is somehow different than a normal adoption. They now want us to assume custody and care of our first child. The only written proof we have is a few texts saying that we need to ""take responsibility"" and that I ""need to contribute more than I might have thought"" because the child isn't normal. They've insinuated on calls that he may need to come live with us soon enough.

We can't afford the care this child needs, and he was legally adopted by these people at birth. What is our obligation here? We've stopped responding at all out of fear of creating an agreement or expectation, and we don't have money to just donate anyway."
205,205,Banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.,"in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I used to take the bus daily to get to work. Not a big deal, I'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

But every thursday was awful. Every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. Still, generally not an issue because I'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

But this bus company was not reliable. We have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. One day, a little school bus came instead. It had 9 seats. Since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. So you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

I have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. Considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, I needed that time to sit down. So, that's what I was doing, as always.

The group gets on the bus, I've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. I look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. I take out my earbuds and she says to me that I need to give up my seat. The other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when I tell her I need it she says that I need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. I try my best to explain that medically I can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says I'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). So after a couple minutes of this I snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as I'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. She gives me a look like I just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

Two days later when I tried to get on the bus I was told I was banned from the service.

When I called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. I explained the medical reasons I needed it and was simply told I have a lower priority because I'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as I ever knew. He ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as I know, but I feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

On my original post it was suggested a lot that I make a post here. I live in Ontario, Canada. I don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. I know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

Anyway that's why I'm here for help. Am I in the right to sue? For how much? I don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

EDIT: There's a lot of responses on here so I'm sorry if I don't get to everyone, but for now I will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Center on Monday. Thanks everyone. I'll still be accepting further advice if there is more I should do though obviously I can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

EDIT: I gave them a call. It went well, should be covered from here. Thanks all."
206,206,"Cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. He was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. I have her recorded confession. What should I do with it? (Arizona)","She accused him of rape years ago. She was 18 and he was 22. It was false and never happened. He was arrested and eventually convicted. When he served his stance and got out he was broken. From what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. He tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. His record, his name on the registry and lack of options. He went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. Within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

Yesterday was 3 years since his death. This cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. I said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. I went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. Also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). She told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. I asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

The voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

Are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? I want to make my brother's slate clean. Not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). His son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. If so, how do we begin the process? Do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

What consequences (criminal) will she face? Will she go to jail?

And, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? Of course this belongs to his son now although I don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). And can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? This conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

I know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. So please help put me in the right direction."
207,207,[AZ] Discovered a video of my father raping me as a child,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.

I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.

Thank you all so much for your support, I am completely shocked right now"
208,208,[MA] Man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. Now they won’t take it off until he verifies that we don’t live together. He’s blocked my number.,"I bought a car last year from a mutual friend that I didn’t know well at all. Everything was fine until this past June, when he fell into some heavy debt. He gave me a call sometime around June, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which I refused. Red flag number one right there. After this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than I should’ve been monthly for this car). I eventually just gave the car back and that was that. I gave the car back mid July and purchased a new one (Nissan Altima) from a legitimate dealer. This morning I received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. I calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don’t live together, (we absolutely do not) I still have to pay it. This is absurd, how is this allowed? The guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can I provide proof for someone else? This is in Massachusetts and I have progressive insurance.


Update #1: okay so a lot has happened since I first posted. For starters, I should clarify some things. We signed an agreement that I would pay monthly increments for the title. Until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. Initially he said I would be under his insurance, but only a few days after I saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. I did not have the car in my name, which is why I was able to give it back so easily. I just thought “screw this drama, I’ll just get a new car.” Today my adjuster happens to be “out sick” but I reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. A representative of Progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. I have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. I’ve been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. I’m expecting a phone call and will update soon.

Update #2: Not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. Luckily I kept all of the text messages between us, which I attached to the reports I filed. With my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it’s a bit difficult to get this taken care of. After I settle this, because I am NOT paying an extra $500, I will most definitely be switching providers."

I wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. Today however was really busy, I spoke to a few people I was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

I'm told by the end of the week I should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything I need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so I can continue to survive until I can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

I'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

I am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

I probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure I was going to be OK and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! I also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that I won't make and explained the situation. They are somewhat understanding and hopefully I'll be back at work soon to keep current. 

Thanks for everyone's help and advice! "
213,213,My coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.,"About 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. It was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. He has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. The police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

Well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. They worked together and went to highschool together. 

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm in a very bad position. Would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? Is there anything I can do legally? It's been about 6 months since the disqualification and I'm in arizona.

Edit: I wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me."
214,214,Landlord thinks my house is his,"Y’all. I’m so annoyed. we’ve been living in our new place for less than a full week and our landlord has popped up over here and tried to just walk in with his key three times. Today I drove up just as he was unlocking our door to walk in and I’m just like “what are you doing here?” 

The first time I walked out of my bedroom up to see him just standing in my living room looking at my thermostat. Literally didn’t even acknowledge the fact that he was in the unit like by saying “anyone home” or anything. I was about to pepper spray the fuck out of him because his back was to me and I was home alone. 

Today he said he needed to do maintenance on the a/c and proceeded to crane his neck to look in every room with a door open and rummage through my cabinets in my kitchen. 

I really don’t wanna be THAT tenant but I can’t do this for a year. It’s always just him telling me some small shit that could have been said over the phone. The anxiety of thinking someone is in my house when I’m not home is too much. I’ve rented since I was 18 and never had a landlord who just pops up at all hours of the day."

216,216,"Rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.","I hired a well reviewed [rover.com](https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on Fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. I dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on Fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) I break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. I find out through Bunz and FB that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

I get into the city and start looking on foot. He informs me that he has called the police and TAS (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough Rover. He then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. Great right? This is where things get unpleasant.

It's -10C outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider I realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. I call [rover.com](https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. I get a tip from Facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to TAS, but I needed to call them for a more accurate description. I call TAS when they open on Sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. At that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that I would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) This is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

I continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, I double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. I finally get a tip off to his location through Facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. This is after 17h straight of walking in -10C weather. I covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because I was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. I couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

I speak to [rover.com](https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. It turns out they were never collected from the Staples that printed them. So this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. I have them now as evidence.

&#x200B;

Emotions aside, is there any course of action I can take to deal with this person? By lying about the search, the posters and the TAS report he delayed valuable search tools that I could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. I also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

This guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. (If at all) 

Edit: to clarify I did eventually find my dog, he’s safe but it was a hellish experience.

218,218,Update: [FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"Link to original post in case you need it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

I've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, I can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) The day after my post, I called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since I inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. He went to both houses the next day, saying that I had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. He went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. Apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how I need to learn my place. After he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) I conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. As expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. I'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, I never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until I watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) The bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""Our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that I'm getting married!"" The pastor, feigning innocence, said ""I thought she was evicting you all because your father and \[Groom\]'s father cut down \[My Great-Grandmother\]'s prize magnolias?"" Hardest game of You-Laugh-You-Lose I've ever played, still proud I survived.

4) According to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. Then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say I would be quite happy with half that number, but I know when to zip my lips so I'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) They did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. I have enough savings/inheritance left that I can live without the rents for a while, so I'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before I was born.

6) The bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. They had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (Am I a bad person for being amused?)

7) Hurricane Michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) My boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

&#x200B;

Other than that, you'll have to wait until the eternally slow court systems process through. I do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time. I'd never really stood up to my elders like that before, and it was comforting to know that not only did a gaggle of internet strangers have my back, but there were resources and protections in my community as well."
219,219,UPDATE Brother's friend wanted a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes and a bed' while he moved back with his parents until the covid crisis is over. My house was packed with stinky furniture and it's all OK now. NSW Australia,"It's all solved. On Monday morning I sent photos of everything disgusting I could and of doug's furniture on the lawn to doug and his dad telling them it's beyond foul and I wouldn't be keeping any of it inside my house, and I'll dump it this week if they don't come get it.

Twenty minutes later I got a call from doug's *mother*. She asked if it was so bad could I send her some evidence, like photos. I told her I'd already sent them to her son and his dad. She yelled out in the background to one of them ""She says she DID send photos"" then she got off the phone.

Half an hour later she called me back and said they'd be down to pick up doug's stuff, and apologised. She asked if his books were OK. Apart from the mouse gnawing and droppings, yes. I'm not a barbarian, they were outside but under the eaves.

This morning they turned up from 600km away. doug and his dad wanted to begin packing in their pantech but doug's mum wasn't having any of that. They dumped 90% of it at the tip and came back & took just a few things home. Even the food in the freezers was off. His mum apologised and offered to make me good with cash, but she's already solved enough and I declined. She left it open ended and said if I needed anything fixed to call her.

I know I didn't follow legal advice, but this was the equivalent of someone asking you to hold onto a small keychain sized box for half a year, but instead they sneakily cover you in fifty kilos of feces you're not allowed to wash off until you get a lawyer and fill out all the right paperwork and wait a month. I just couldn't do it. I got lucky.

I've had words with my brother and changed the locks to my place too. He'd opened up and let doug and doug's mates in, then left the key behind with him. He didn't know how bad it was either.

My brother is an idiot and doug is a 32 year old baby and hopefully I'm a little wiser."

221,221,[MA] A restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant,"So I wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

I won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks I've missed out something crucial, I'll be happy to edit the post.

My boyfriend and I went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. My boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. We had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. We arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

We have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. The waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. She said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. We see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. She says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. She started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). The waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. She came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. We said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

We flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. She was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. She told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. She asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. The waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

The waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but I insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. She went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

My boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. As of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

On my original post, I was given many different types of advice; I was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. As I have been looking after my boyfriend all night, I have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. As a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the ER or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. However, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


TL;DR - My celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?"
222,222,"UPDATE: I am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. I got found out.","I post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

How incredibly bad is that plan? Before anyone says it. I know... I know ok I should have quit a long time ago. I did not.

My fiance, now husband did pull through! He's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys. He was in a coma for over a month and the doctor's were pretty sure he would never wake up. His recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier! Although it was a horrible thing to go through it changed both of us for the better. You don't realize how much the small things matter until they're about to be taken from you. 


He was appalled by his sisters actions when I finally discussed it with him. We recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance SIL or BIL will get any money if both of us were to pass, or God forbid our children too. We also chose godparents for our children and we are expecting a baby girl in 2018!

225,225,I found explicit videos and pictures in my child's phone,"My ex and I share custody of our daughter (age 6). When I picked her up today, she brought her phone that usually stays at her dad's house. She was showing me pictures she took, and as I was scrolling I found dozens of nude pictures and videos of men mastubating in her cloud. These pictures have been uploaded for the last 6 months at least, and she has had access to them. 

If what I think is the case is true, then it seems like her grandfather has a dirty little secret, and because her phone is logged into the same account as his is their pictures sync to the same cloud. If this is true he probably has no clue that he has basically been giving her access to this stuff. However, like I said she has had access to these things for the last 6 months at least which is unacceptable and extremely worrisome.

What should I do? Is there any legal action I should take? She was extremely upset when I found them and tried to hide them. She also lied about not recognizing one of the men in the pictures. It is actually someone she knows very well. I am planning on trying to find a therapist maybe to talk to her about what all she may have seen, but I'm really at a loss right now. It's 2 am, and I don't know what to do. Also in Louisiana if that makes a difference.

EDIT: For those that are lucky enough to not have to coparent with a difficult ex or have not been through a divorce--here is some insight as to how custody orders work. As we have joint custody, we both have to agree on decisions regarding medical issues and education. Outside of those things, we each get to set the pace when our child is in our care. Ideally we would mostly be on the same page, but my ex is much more lax than I am about basically everything. Not only do I not want to change our moderately structured routine to match his lack of one, I have two additional kids in my home that thrive on it and changing it every other week to match his level of parenting would be terrible for them.

We had a conversation about the phone when they gave it to her two years ago (YES SHE HAD JUST TURNED 5), and I objected. If I had any actual legal grounds to prevent them from giving it to her, we wouldn't be in this situation."

OP is still published at the bottom of this post

I know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. Which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how stupid I must be for believing his reasoning. Whelp! He got off house arrest on Tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), I asked if he would mind if I uploaded his “certificate of completion” to reddit and he said that was fine.

[Certificate of Completion ](https://imgur.com/a/BY974wg)

A few people asked some really good questions so I’m going to try to be as clear as possible:

He really was not on probation or parole. When he went to trial he was given the option to “complete the program,” which was a year with a PRIVATELY OWNED house arrest company. If he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

The terms of his house arrest, as per the company’s rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. He could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. Every other week he was required to “check in,” which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. He had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

Now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was “sentenced” due to DUS charges).

He was never on parole. He was never on probation. This entire ordeal was due to being a “habitual traffic offender.” A year of house arrest. For driving without insurance. He could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. Does ANY of that make what he did okay? Absolutely not. But I did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. He has completed the program and now we’re going to the beach.

Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk I hope this cleared things up. Sorry for the lengthy post.

OP:

Title explains it all. What is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? I suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn’t go anywhere. He thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn’t go anywhere. 

Time is a factor. What do we do??

Edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. He called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it’s supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iPhone so we even shared his location with them. Everything we could think of.


At 12:29am we got this text back:
“Sorry so late.. I have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. I looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn’t. Either it’s not connected or charger not working. Still showing low battery. Call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. I’m sorry.”

Crisis averted. Sounds like we’ll just stay put until the office opens and then we’ll go in to get everything checked, and we’ll be sharing his iPhone location with them until then.

I would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. We are in South Carolina.
2. He is not on probation or parole. He has never in his life been convicted of a crime. He was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were DUIs, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. The house arrest company is a privately owned business. There is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/WEEK. Capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

Thanks again for everything and if anything changes I’ll let y’all know.

Final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! Horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. Thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

EDITEDIT: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. I want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. I may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once I get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it’s late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. Thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


Absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: Okay kids, it’s been a long day. We laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. But at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf’s current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three DUS (driving under suspension) arrests. He was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. Irresponsible? Oh absolutely, he’s known from the beginning how I feel about it. But, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. The disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where I was confused and as a result confused some of y’all. He had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. Was that stuff irresponsible? Yes. Illegal?? Also yes. But a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? You betcha. We had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and I learned a lot. To everyone saying I’m dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and I’m sorry to disappoint you but that’s all there is to it. He will be getting off house arrest on September 10th, and to celebrate we’re going to the beach. The end."
230,230,"Cousin needs a life-saving hysterectomy but insurance doctor won't approve because ""She's not done having babies.""","My cousin has been getting these terrible infections after having her first child. After trying a few treatments, her doctor informed her she's at serious risk of life-threatening hemorrhaging and she needs a hysterectomy.

231,231,[UPDATE][Oregon] Neighbor cut down trees on my property,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


Hello legal advice community! I have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! I'll get right to it. I can't speak to all the details, and I'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway I figured it would be best not to). To keep it short, we (my lawyer and I) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). I don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


I hauled his ass into court. Well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. The trees were on my property and they were white oaks. The arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. I also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. It then became a question of whether I wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. Basically, do I want the trees back or do I want the cost of the ones I lost? (apparently you can't have both).

Well guys...

I PICKED THE TREES.

The actual court stuff started a lot sooner than I thought. We filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. Apparently he was wealthier than I thought. We accepted and while I can't speak to the details of it...

I'M GETTING THE TREES BACK!

It's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until September since the process didn't start until just this week due to the Holidays), but I will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! My neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and I haven't seen him for quite some time now. Oh well! There's a bit more to the settlement, but I don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

I remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. I ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. My trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). Not even close! Just thought I'd add that in.


Anyways, there it is! I plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and I have them back. I'll be sure to share them! I want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! I didn't know you all were so into trees, but I'm glad you are!

Have a good one everyone!"

233,233,Suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. She requested I take care of her children (1m 3f). Her family took them instead against her wishes. (UT),"My best friend is a single mom. The other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. She has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. She has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

She has requested that I take care of her children while she is gone. We are very close and her children love me. She trusts me completely with them. We have plans to move in together in soon. I am not a parent, but I have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

I received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). They wanted to watch the children for a little bit. I was fine with this as I wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. My friend was very upset that I let her cousin watch her children and requested I pick them up as soon as possible. She has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

Her family doesn't want to return the children to me. They claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. They believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

What can I do in this case? Her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. I have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. She even wants the children to be with me and not them. Does her will not matter to CPS? Would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? Or would I be completely fine caring for her children?

**Edit: I have received a lot of great advice. Thank you! I will be going to get the children asap. Many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. I can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. She also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state I am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that I am having difficulty getting them back. Should I continue to have difficulty, I will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. I would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. I understand their concern about CPS and I'm hoping that the advice I receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and CPS won'tbe an issue. Should I show them my home and that I am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**Edit 2: I have the children back. I talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me CPS was a non-issue. She even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. Her friend is with me in this and believes I am fully fit to have them. Still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and I'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**Edit 3: Thread has been locked but I have received plenty of helpful advice. Thank you for all of your well wishes. I have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. The 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. I also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. I am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**"
234,234,I was fired for not coming into work with 5.5 hours notice sent at 3:30 am.,"This happened in San Antonio, Texas.

So at 3:30 am today, my boss texted me to come into work at 9 am. I was asleep and didn't check my phone until 3:30 pm. I responded by saying I was asleep when I got his text and if I had been awake, 5.5 hours is not enough time to sleep before a day of work(8.5 hour shift). I also asked him to please start giving me 24 hours of notice before work (he never posted a schedule, only texted me at most two days before he needed me to come in, though often less than a day's notice). I was never once 'on-call'.

I was a part-time, W-2 employee (I think, because tax deductions are on my paychecks, though I was never given a W-4), though I always drew my paychecks from the folder labeled 'contract labor'. I was employed from 7/30 until 11/11 (today).

As I understand it, the Fair Labor Standards act says employers need to give at least 24 hours notice before work, but I am in an at-will employment state and nothing I can find online tells me whether or not this federal act applies here. Is there grounds to sue for this?

Edit: Someone else mentioned to me this might count as retaliation. Is that true?"

He has been arrested for the child porn. Unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. It's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. People wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

My sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. We are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... Ideally.. 

She and I both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. Our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  Mom is still not in the picture.

I fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. My case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. Thanks for that advice reddit, I got that from here. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice. It helped me talk her into how serious it was.

(New York)

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

Thank you."
239,239,(Ohio) Cop blocking my driveway and harassing me and my wife.,"**EDIT** 

Holy wow this blew up. Thanks for the silver kind stranger! I received so many messages, so if I don't reply to your message I'm really sorry. I will go through and reply to as many as possible!

I have received so much amazing information on this post since I made it. Unfortunately it is a holiday today and I am going to try spending today with friends. I am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can’t figure this out. No updates or calls back as of yet... I’ll keep everyone posted.

As of 12/31 at 3:40PM EST I have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. I have yet to get a call back. I’ll update everyone here when I get a call back (if I do.)

Hello Legal Advice!

So, here’s some backstory:

Me and my fiancé moved into this new place back in April. We’ve been living here since then. The town I live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. The cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. There is a major highway that runs between here and Cincinnati. They are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what’s happening in town. 

Fast forward until now. There was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiancé had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that’s kinda loud). She was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. She took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. Right? Nah.

Now, this guy knows where we live. He drives by all the time and he knows when my fiancé leaves for work. He follows me now, in my 2010 Honda Civic (it’s a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as I do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. There is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and “clock” people, however, it’s right across from our home.

Today was the last straw. When my fiancé was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. He is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. He sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as I’m almost home begins pulling out. My fiancé needed to go to work, so I decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

On her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiancé to leave. He sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. She calls me and says she’s afraid to leave, so I tell her to stay for a bit. He eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

Here’s the kicker. My ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. I’ve saved a copy to my phones storage. What can we do about this? This is clearly harassment and this guy doesn’t let up. It’s a shame when I’m fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. Is there any way I can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? I only fear this will make things a lot worse. Cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

Feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

Thanks, sorry for the long post."
240,240,I think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. What options do I have? (OK)," I’m a high school teacher. I work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. “Dan,” my “across the hall mate” has  been here 8. His son,”Leo” has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. Leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. Since Dan was the football coach, Leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. Leo would  often visit his dad’s classroom before and after school and I got to  know him as well. Leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

This past summer, Dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. They asked me if I would be a source of support for  Leo while they were away. While Leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so I would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. I also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. The last day I was to be in this role, Leo sent me a VERY  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. I told Leo that  was inappropriate and that I would be telling his father.

I showed Dan the text and he claimed that Leo’s phone must’ve been  “hacked” or “played with” while Leo was at work. I didn’t believe that  explanation, but I accepted it and moved on. The next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from Leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could “hold on to me” and “take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler” and “kiss me gently.” I forwarded the texts to Dan and did not  response to Leo.

Dan came to my house the next day and said that Leo was not sending  those texts. He said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. Then, I started getting texts through some “unknown number”  that were the same in tone and writing. A selfie of Leo nude was also  sent. I called Dan, thinking this might be something happening at Leo’s  job or something.

This didn’t stop. I was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. As soon as I blocked one, another popped up. I went down to the  store where Leo worked and spoke with the manager. (I taught all of his  children). He told me that Leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker’s phone and he had already talked to Dan about it two weeks  ago! So, Dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

I changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. This included my new number. Dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. The next thing I know, I’m getting crazy texts again. I  said something to Dan at work. Dan said Leo was “harmless” and I should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more I avoid him, the  more miserable it makes Leo. Dan even said those days that my number  stopped working Leo became very angry and Dan had to give him  medication.

Last night, when I got home from work, my kids told me that Leo had  come by looking for me. I was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. The kids said he arrived in a car, but not Dan’s car.  My son guessed it was an Uber. I don’t want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

Am I being stalked?  
Am I being unsympathetic to Leo’s problems?  
Is it wrong of me to expect Dan to manage his son’s problems?  
What do I do next? 

I’m not going anywhere, and I doubt Dan is, so we will be “across the hall mates” for another 10 years…

(I initially posted this to relationships but was told this was a better place for it.)

Thank you in advance for any suggestions."
241,241,Minor Daughter Refuses Abortion.,"TW: Sex, Minor

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm still shook and my boyfriend and I have been freaking out since we found out. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

Our daughter is 11 years old. We found out she was pregnant. She had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. We never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
I'm at such a fucking loss. My world is crumbling.

Officially as of today Jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. We were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). Which i did. Honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

I talked to someone who is doing a story on Jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on AirBNB (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). She isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

I don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. AirBNB to this day still has my place being listed on AirBNB. Who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

My apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. There are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. But my apartment is safe more or less. 

Anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at Christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. "
245,245,[NE] HOA towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land,"So this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

Link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


So I was away for the holidays and I came back on Monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to HOA. I immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. The car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so I have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. It's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the HOA.


I had my lawyer draft up the C&D and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. I hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since I'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

My lawyer suggested I send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. A local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested I ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. The HOA has lawyered up so I think it's best I no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. I didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. I've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. It's bad but should convey the land.

246,246,I'm pregnant and I want to leave my husband [update],"Hi everyone,

I want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. I read every single comment on both threads about my situation and I really really appreciate the support and help. If not for the advice here, I probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

I'm sorry for taking so long to post, but I am now back home in NH with my parents. I feel like I'm coming out of a fog and I feel really stupid for believing everything; I guess I just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

I left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. I'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as I am still on my dad's phone plan. My husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but I haven't spoken to him.

I managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. The third is a local bank and I did not want to stay in the area any longer. My parents told me to just leave the money. They are going to help me get the medical procedures I need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. I thought they would say I told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree. 

Thank you again for all your kind words!"
247,247,Update - PhD student here being accused of plagiarism. Only that it's my own work that I used. Massachusetts.,"I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my PhD thesis.

To make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what I had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. This wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

Last week I got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that I talked to. The email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, I will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

I asked for appointments with a few people. Head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. I haven't managed to see any of them yet.

Today, I received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. They apologized for the stress that this has caused. A little later, I received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who I talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

So that's that. Now I can graduate in peace. I cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. Thanks all for advice. "
248,248,Being sued for helping a choking victim (OR),"I was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. I realized he was choking and went to help him, I had Heimlich training at my place of work (I’m office safety manager for my floor). The guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. He looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. I felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. This was two weeks ago.
 
Today I got a letter from a law firm that I’m getting sued for battery, they said I bruised a rib, I have no clue how this guy figured out who I am. I thought I helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. How did he figure out who I am? I never actually spoke to him. Is this a real letter? Do I need a lawyer for this?
 

Edit: the language i used to describe him choking was wrong. He was choking, gagging sounds but otherwise silent and obviously distressing. "
249,249,"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they’ll drop me from my classes","(IA) I was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

I am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and I’ll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

I’d spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days I’d be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work I’d be missing. 

Unfortunately, one of the days I’ll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

His request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if I missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

My professors were comfortable marking these as “reported absences” which basically means there was a justification like a doctor’s note or other official documentation. 

I showed the deans that I was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn’t  even really like I had a choice. I figured that would be enough documentation. 

The dean said that “personal non-medical conflicts” could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if I’d just  slept through class). They suggested I apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise I’d be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

This attack took enough from me already, I went to great lengths to be sure I didn’t miss a day of school while recovering, I do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

I spoke to the title IX Office who’d promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

I do not want to take a leave of absence. All my professors were ready and willing to work with me and I was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

Do I have any legal recourse here against the school? 

Thank you in advance. "

It's been almost 3 months now and I thought I'd come in real quick to give an update. 

Overall, the kid and I are doing great. I really expected the adjustment period to suck but I feel like maybe this poor kid really needed some structure and stability and totally glommed onto that. I try to just give her as much of my love, patience, structure and stability that I have to give. I've been learning a lot about attachment, trauma, and everything. It's been overwhelming but every night, no matter how exhausted I am, I get into bed and I thank God for her. I wouldnt trade her for anything in this world. I tell her every night she's my favorite thing. 

Legally things are kind of boring. I did the DNA test, unsurprisingly got the result that she's mine biologically. The emergency order is still in place. Had mom is still in jail, she was offered the option of going to rehab and refused. She'll be in jail for at least a few more months, and after she's out we will make a parenting plan for visits with help from the social worker. Realistically i think she'll die before she gets clean. That sounds like a horrible thing to say but it is how it is. 

It's been a wild ride. It's not easy. But it's joyful and it's really changed my life & made me want to be better in a lot of ways."
251,251,Boss constantly touches/chokes/body checks me. Others who report similar behavior to HR have been fired.,"NJ: I am an adult male and my boss (male, few years older) consistently touches me in front of dozens of other people in a professional office setting.

I’ve told him to stop but that makes it worse. Other people have complained to HR and been fired for this exact complaint, so I feel like I have no recourse there. 

On top of that he is a blatant racist and sexist, and says shit out loud in the office that I wouldn’t even say to my friends at the bar.

252,252,Does my employer have the right to tell me that I'm not allowed to use food banks - WA,"I'm a social worker, and work primarily with homeless teens. It's something I'm passionate about because I fled my mom's sexually abusive boyfriend when I was 13 and have been flying solo ever since, so I can really relate to what it's like being a street kid. I enjoy my job and feel like I'm really good at it. However, I only make about 29k/yr. I have a husband who's a forklift operator, and together we have four children, a cat, and a dog. Our household income is about 40-50% of the median income for Seattle, we live paycheck to paycheck. When crap hits the fan and unexpected expenses come up, we often need to use food banks, and then we normally use things like free clinics and the Salvation Army coat drive. It's not unheard of for me to run into current kids in the program and former clients from work when accessing these services. 

My employer overheard some kids (clients) in the office talking about how they saw me with my children at the food bank over the weekend. I brushed it off like, oh yeah they're great folks, our car has been giving us trouble and we needed a little help. No big deal right? I naturally transitioned the conversation into other things that weren't about me.   


So my boss pulls me into his office later and starts grilling me about why I'm using the foodbank. Uh, because you pay me 29k/yr? I have a family? My car keeps breaking down and I can't afford to replace it? It was like he was trying to shame me. He was acting like I was gaming the system because I'm a social worker, taking resources because I can, which couldn't be further from reality. He brought up the ethics of seeing clients outside of work and how I needed to be mindful of places I went, saying I shouldn't be going to the foodbanks and resources that we refer clients to--which, spoiler alert, is pretty much all of them in the city. I told him that I was eligible to use them based on my income, that my family depended on them to eat right now, that I wasn't using my employment status to garner any kind of favoritism, and that I went to the foodbanks closest to my house. 

He basically told me that I need to stop going to the food bank or I'd be let go.

It turns out, I actually ended up calling the wrong police jurisdiction. This morning I called the East Lansing PD non-emergency line (whom I called the previous night), and I spoke to an officer who told me that they only have jurisdiction on campus and 3 blocks surrounding campus. The venue/bar I was attending is actually on the city line between East Lansing and Lansing, so the officer directed me to the Lansing PD. 

The LPD officer told me that bar always calls about fake ID's and-- in his words-- ""90% of the time, they're wrong"" so he told me not to worry and he would get my identification back for me. Long story short, I got my stuff back and I got to rub it in the bartender and managers face that I was right all along. "
254,254,Friend forced to have sex with boss while she was incapacitated,"My friend was interning during her summer while she was studying at university in Pennsylvania. Her boss was always very nice to her, and asked her to get drinks with him on her last day of work. They went to a bar, and got sufficiently drunk - where he admitted he was attracted to her. She brought up the fact that he's married, and he acknowledged it. He wanted her to come to his house to meet his wife. She agreed, and so they went to his place. My friend met the wife, and they all drank some more. At this point, my friend blacked out and can't remember anything that happened after this point. She only remembers her boss saying, ""you should take your pants off."" She doesn't even remember if she did do that.

Next morning, the wife was dropping her off, and was extremely hostile with her. Turns out, the boss had sex with my friend, while the wife was watching. The wife also apparently made out with my friend. In the morning, the wife forced my friend to take a Plan B (apparently, the guy didn't use a condom). She somehow got a hold of my friend's phone number, social media handles etc., and harrasses her regularly - calls her names and insults her a lot. 

My friend is afraid to take any kind of action as she does not want her parents to find out (she's an international student). What options does she have? Is it possible for her to proceed legally in the US without her parents ever finding out back home?"

I told the first two (who arrived together) they were not welcome, and that just because I asked the company to remove me from the mailing list does not mean I instead want them to come to my door.  They were upset with my telling them this, but left.  I work from home and make phone calls and they cause my dog to start barking, so this interrupts my work.

I presumed contact would stop.  A few weeks later, another rep showed up.  I told him I had already advised his company that their reps are not welcome and he is now trespassing.  The rep stated, ""yeah I know, but that wasn't \*me\*.""  He emphasized the ""me"" part of that, which told me the company was aware I told reps to leave, but planned to swap out reps and send new ones.

I called my local sheriff and the deputy told me that he could not go to Spectrum itself and serve them any sort of notice, as he could do with individuals.  He said he would recommend I reach out to the company further.  

I contacted Spectrum's chat (no corporate number available) and was escalated to a manager, and informed them that I have repeatedly told their agents to leave and any further agents they send are violating 17-A MRS §402 and are trespassing.  I advised her I work from home and of the disruption.  She verified my address and assured me that I was removed from further contacts.  I saved screenshots of the chat.

Yesterday, another Spectrum agent arrived knocking at my door.  I opened the door, took a picture of him, walked out and took a picture of his license plate, and called the sheriff, and asked a deputy to arrive to explain to this rep that this business cannot continue to do this.  He arrived, took down the name and DOB of the rep, and said he can only issue criminal trespass notices to each rep.  The Spectrum rep's manager called him and said he would be there.  The agent asked for my number so the manager could call me, and I provided it to him.  I advised the deputy he can meet with the manager, but if he doesn't feel I need to be around I am going back to work.  He did so (I could see from the window) and I believed it resolved.  

I received a call from the manager, which I thought would be apologetic.  It was not.  He advised me that since the house is a rental, if he takes it off the list for ""service"" (these are not service calls; they are sales) then no other tenants in the future could have service.  I advised him that is not true, because those tenants could simply call Spectrum and change the status, since both he and the agent have told me this is a toggle-able feature in their system.  He said he would not do that and I said that I hear him implying I have no rights as the tenant, and that the landlord needs to contact him, but he is not explicitly stating that; he is just stating he will not remove me from marketing because he wants to continue in spite of being told they are not welcome.  He advised me he did not feel the call was productive at that point (at no point did I swear or curse) and I advised him at this point he is pushing me to a lawsuit.  He said to go ahead and file my lawsuit.  I told him that is never something a manager should tell a customer, and he said ""yeah, hearsay buddy"" and disconnected.  

I am awestruck at this point.  I have done everything I can think of and Spectrum has acknowledged the impact to my work, has acknowledged my multiple reports to the authorities, and because of the apparent unprofessional culture of their sales managers, they are going to continue to harass me at my residence.  

Can anyone with knowledge of a person's rights in this sort of situation in Maine give me advice?  I have no idea what to do at this point to avoid the continued harassment and trespassing."
256,256,Diabetes,"Hey, my 17 year old son has T1 diabetes. He relies mainly on his phone for glucose monitoring. Yesterday the public school he attends took his phone. Their policy is that is you are “Using for your phone to much” they take it. First time 1 day. Second time 3 days. Third time 5 days. (End of school week) In the past is has not been a problem because after school I have been able to get it. I am out of the country on business and my wife is out of state as well. My wife called the school and they say the will only give the phone back to a “Parent or Legal Guardian” the school knows he has Diabetes. There is no documentation that he uses his phone for glucose. He offered to show the principal. Yesterday my son went to the drug store after school and got a finger pricker. He told me he would be “Fine”. I know how much he hates using one and it is not as good as the continuous glucose monitor on his phone. What legal rights do I have to make the achool give him back his phone before Thursday when My wife gets home?

I am in Alabama

Thank you all the support and advice. My son’s endo faxed an order and made multiple thinly veiled threats over the phone. My wife’s mother went and met my son at school today. They gave her his phone. We have his phone. All is good for now. However, to make sure this doesn’t happen again I am going to have a lawyer send a letter and hopefully scare them shitless. They are going into apologies and cover my ass mode. It is getting late here is Germany and I have a big day tomorrow. Thanks again!"
257,257,Found out wife was married before me and never divorced,"My wife and I are getting divorced after 19 years of marriage. She moved out 2 weeks ago and is living with her parents. The kids are with me. One of my daughters was at grandma's house this week visiting her mom and grandma mentioned to her this is her second marriage. My daughter mentioned it to me when she got home. I phoned my wife and she told me her high school boyfriend (he was 18, she was 16) took off to Mexico and got legally married. When they broke up a year later, they just broke up, never divorced. 
I have called my attorney to get some answers on this, his legal aide said he is out until Tuesday. It is killing me. I basically have 2 questions. Was I even married? We wed in the U.S., not Mexico and divorcing in the U.S. And two, we have a beach house in Cabo San Lucas. Is that now owned by 3 people (her first husband) and will that affect the sale when we try to sell? 

Also, no, I did not file for divorce because of this. It was just growing apart. I actually think it is kind of funny as long as it doesn't mess things up."
258,258,My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised daughter. Update.,"[Wow, that last post got real popular it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/), for better and for worse. Seeing as you guys got were interested in it I thought I would come back with an update. 

&#x200B;

Well, a lot has happened since that day. My daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. She is getting better every day. I know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200B;

After I made that post I took the advice given to me and the next time I saw my daughter I told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. Along with that I saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. When I went to see him he told me that this is ""A case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. I immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. I also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. He says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. Along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything I gave to him. He has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200B;

During this time, my ex started to get suspicious. Maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? Who knows. A few days later when I saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. She became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. Including telling me that I want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. She was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. After this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that I am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. This was sent to my lawyer. As he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200B;

Outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200B;

This week I received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. I have heard that the DA is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200B;

And that's really it for now. I'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. I do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. When this is all said and done, if the interest is still there I may come back again. But for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

260,260,"Manager told coworkers I was suicidal and a “pill popper”, I brought it up and now I have no job.","(FL, USA)

Yup, you read this crazy title correctly. Awhile back I had some major health issues and required a few surgeries to resolve things, and because of that I had to take some time off work. Management knew the situation, why I would be out and when I would return to work. One manager sent an email to my coworkers, without realizing I was also on the email chain, saying that I was in the hospital because I had popped some pills and tried to overdose and end it all; he said I may not ever come back to work, since I may not wake up. I only know this because 1) I was on the email chain and 2) MANY coworkers starting reaching out, very very concerned for me and saying they hoped I would be alright and recover. This all seemed so odd to me until I saw the email chain. I have NO clue what compelled this manager to do this, other than I know he was very mad with me taking short term medical leave, because he told me that. But being suicidal and overdosing was NOT at all true, I was just having another surgery. When I came back to work things were just awkward with coworkers, trying to explain that somehow what this manager said was not true, many people welcomed me back and said they couldn’t believe I was alive - it was just so weird. I tried ignoring it but it really made the relationship with some coworkers a bit more awkward, as they really didn’t know what to believe, because why would a manager make something like that up? When I finally had the confidence to ask some general questions about all this to the manager he was clearly annoyed, he did not want to talk about it, and oddly enough the next morning I came in I was told I no longer had a job. Even though my contract was good for another year, it was abruptly ended, after I brought up my concerns about this entire situation to this manager. I could not help but think these are somehow related. Even if they are not, and they had a legitimate reason to get rid of me and my job, what was said about my health issues, the lies that were told, I think should have never happened. And now I worry that once I leave work, what this manager could try putting in my file that may prevent me from working elsewhere in the company in the future. If they were willing to spread something so atrocious and untrue, what else would they do? I’m struggling to figure out what I should do, if anything. Do I just forget it and move on? Tell HR so that my side of the story is documented? I have the emails and numerous coworkers who would vouch for what they were told, both via email and what he said to them in person. Is there anything I can do? As I said, I just can’t shake the feeling that me asking about what transpired, and seeing how annoyed that made him, that the very next day I’m unexpectedly told my position is over and ending early....

261,261,What happened to my brain damage settlement?,"When I was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car I was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. There was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. My left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. My heart ended up stopping for a while and I was revived. I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from. I'm not saying I'd ask for it back, for all I know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but I still have a right to know. How do I do that without help from my parents?

Edit: This happened in Missouri, STL.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and Ive been able to use case net to find my old case. Unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? But I do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. Specifically when I was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. I'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

But im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. Some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. Despite my head injury I'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal UN-serial killer life. Thank you."
262,262,"[Update] I allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say I kidnapped her to avoid child support (CT to NY)","Update of my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200B;

So, I had my day in court today for the child support hearing. Dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. My sister (let's call her Valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but I'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because I could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

The judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that Valerie is now 18 and in CT would be ineligible but in NY would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

Dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of Valerie and that Mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  Then he said how Valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that Mom never speaks to him about anything, that I make no effort to have a relationship with him and that Valerie doesn't either. Boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  Sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""Why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

He then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. At that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, I piped up and asked as calmly as I could manage ""Why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at Mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

My mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if I could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. Valerie was 17 at the time she moved to NYS and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and I've been her sole source of support ever since. 

The judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. My mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. Dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. The judge asked me what amount I was looking for. My answer was that I just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so I asked for a total of $250 from Dad and the max $50 from Mom. Dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). The judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and I held firm on $250. Dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

The judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 AND I never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

Thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for Dad's intimidation tactics.

263,263,My ex has a restraining order against me and now lives in the same apartment complex,"My Ex Wife and I had a rocky marriage, my alcoholism didn't help. She pushed for a divorce.  We lived together during this divorce and one day I found out she was dating another man. I snapped and hit her, pretty hard. I was charged with assault, spent 3 months in jail, went to anger management and I was also issued a 3 yr restraining order.

&#x200B;

This was 2 yrs ago. I have since sobered up, met a wonderful woman and moved to a completely different apartment complex in a completely different part of the city and never had any further contact with my Ex Wife. I admit what I did was wrong, I paid the price, I've seen re-established myself. My current woman who I've been in a relationship with for 2 yrs is aware of this back ground story (which makes things slightly easier)

&#x200B;

Well unknown to me my ex moved into my apartment complex about 5 months ago with her now new husband (who had always lived here, I did not know this) I saw her in the lobby just before new years. She greeted me, I turned shocked and said hello. She asked me what I was doing in the lobby I said I was just coming in from work she told me that the restraining order is still in effect and I need to move out.

&#x200B;

I tried to reason with her and told her I'd be happy to steer clear of her, I know we don't live on the same floor (I don't even know what floor she lives on, I don't care to know) I told her if I saw her on an elevator I wouldn't get in and just wait for the next one. She told me she was going enforce the restraining order against me.

&#x200B;

My partner and I literally just signed a brand new 2 yr lease 6 months ago. We love the place we live in, and wouldn't want to move. And it feels unjust having to move/incur financial hardship because the person I had a restraining order against moved into my apartment complex. 

&#x200B;

The reason why I'm bringing this up is cause last night building management was informed of the restraining order and told us we need to figure this out.

&#x200B;

Would she really be able to force me out of my home even though I lived here before her? As long as I do my best to avoid any contact with her (which I'm perfectly fine doing) shouldn't that be sufficient? I work a really early schedule and the fact is she was dating this guy and coming over to this apartment complex for the entire time I've been here, and we ran crossed paths, and she's been living here full time for 5 months and just recently crossed paths. Not sure what to do.

264,264,UPDATE: My dad's house is serviced by a community well that is now owned by an HOA..,"Hi all I wanted to update on the outcome of this.  Sorry, it's honestly a pretty boring outcome - no cool courtroom outbursts at all sadly.  It turns out there were just some liars and there was never actually a legal problem in the first place, my dad was just the victim of the HOA trying to scam him.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gijkoz/iowa_my_dads_house_is_serviced_by_a_community/) is my original thread. The summary is that my dad lives in a house served by a community well that is next to an HOA (but my dad is not part of it).  The HOA told my dad that they now own the well and that he needs to join the HOA and effectively pay them $800/mo to use the well service plus the actual water bill on top of it.

He did end up getting a lawyer to see him ASAP. The lawyer told him the first thing he needed to do was get records of ownership for the well and try to get his hands on the details of the sale. However after a couple days he said he was having issues getting up to date records and was waiting to hear back from a contact at the county because he wasn't sure if COVID had delayed records filing or what.

Then my dad got a surprise: a water bill from the original well servicer, right on time for their 3-times-a-year billing. Obviously that's odd considering he's been told that they don't own the well anymore, and he called them up.

It turns out he was just lied to. The well servicer was never looking to get out of the well business permanently, but rather was looking to contract out the day-to-day testing services of the well to another company because many of the wells they service now require more testing than they did years ago and they no longer have the manpower to do all of it themselves.  But they were not selling the well, simply hiring an independent contractor to drive around and do well stuff all day.

During that time the HOA had asked them to attend an HOA meeting so residents could ask questions about things like filtration, and they mentioned it at that meeting to let residents know that they would be seeing a new person going around doing testing and wanted to let them know because the testing involves taking samples from individual properties and they didn't want anyone to be freaked out.

So when the HOA told my dad they now owned the well, they were just plain lying. When the HOA said they had a new company doing the servicing, they were half truthful: a new company was doing the testing, but the HOA had nothing to do with it, the contract is between the original well servicer and the individual guy they're contracting out to.

The original well servicer also told my dad that the HOA had reached out and informed them around the same time they were contacting my dad, that they were taking over handling billing, and that the well servicer should bill the HOA for all properties and the HOA would then include it in the HOA dues billing to ""streamline"" things for residents claiming it would make their residents' lives easier if they only had to keep track of one bill and not multiple. However the HOA actually has no authority to just declare this and the well servicer just outright told them no, they will continue to bill individual properties.  The timing of this coincides with when they started contacting my dad, so they were just trying to pull a fast one on everyone.

The well servicer is confident that the HOA has 0 legal authority over the well situation and says they respected the HOA in an organizational capacity, like calling meetings so residents could ask questions, and were professionally annoyed with them trying to insert themselves into billing, but they were not aware that the HOA was claiming to own the well. They told my dad that he should not give the HOA any money for water servicing or accept water servicing related information from them in any way.

So going back around to the lawyer, my dad got an appointment with the lawyer to tell him all this and the lawyer had his own news that matched up entirely: The reason he wasn't finding up to date records following the supposed sale was because he doesn't believe a legitimate sale has happened, he thinks my dad was just getting scammed.

So all in all my dad will continue to use the well as he always has.  He is pretty angry that he had to spend a bunch of money to find out what he already knew, that the HOA is made of dicks, but we are definitely breathing a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile as for the HOA my father's lawyer has suggested that there may be room for legal action against the HOA reps for what was basically fraudulent claims. My father doesn't want to spend the money persuing it at this time, but the well servicer did ask for copies of everything he received from the HOA because they want to review it with their own lawyer.

Thanks to everyone who gave advice - we're grateful for it and also for the fact that we didn't have to use most of it, ha ha!"

Concerning eviction/retaliation, I have not lived at the rental residence for a year now. I was in fact homeless and living in a tent for 7 months of last year and am only recently in assisted housing thanks to my state's Department of Social and Health Services. It took time, but I jumped through all the hoops and they deemed me worthy of housing assistance.  I could not be more thankful.

I know she (former landlord) had filed me as a dependent as she admitted as much via text message. She claimed then (2 months ago) that she would correct it but has not as far as I can tell.

The housing was not assisted at that time and my mother was kind enough to pay for my rent for 5 months before I moved outside waiting for housing to come through. Paid by check. I have the copies.

How do I live on $200 month? Not very well. I recently bought underwear for the first time in years. I had to save up for it. My internet is 9.95/month through a low income program. My cel phone is free service also through low income program. I live at the grace of the state for now.

Not only was the landlord not a caregiver, but I cooked, did yard work, took care of the cats etc. She is 70.

Thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

My sister and I contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in Karachi. They were able to verify that she exists and she's a US citizen. We told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

The challenge was getting her into the consulate in Karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the US. We bought tickets for her to go from Karachi to Doha and then to Boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

By the time her parents realized what's what she was on the Doha to Boston flight. Her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the US but their visa applications were refused. I'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

She currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. Her priority is to learn English. 

Her parents still try to somehow make her return but we've closed down the lines of communication and hopefully her life from now on will be stress-free. "

Except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. This morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

I know morally going back and paying is the right choice. But what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? Because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if I go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should I go back and pay our tab?

Edit: this all happened in Eastern Europe, part of the EU.

Update: I felt really guilty so I went back there around opening hours. They were extremely above and beyond nice about it. Apologized and explained the situation. They said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. I'm pretty sure we didn't pay so I insisted, but they were like ""Don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" Tbh I'm so embarrassed I probably won't go back there for a long while, but I am glad I tried to do the right thing.

The next day I received an email that said something like, “Supporting documents that accompany your transcript get destroyed after 5-7 years, so this is going to be tough, but we’ll continue to look into it.”

Not really the response I was hoping for, but I guess at very least they’re “looking into it”.

The other day I filed a complaint with the department of education, but I would really like options on what legal standing I have. This whole thing could have a ripple effect through my life in some pretty catastrophic ways, as well as being emotionally exhausting. It’s hard to imagine calling up your school nearly 13 years after leaving and hearing them tell you that you dropped out and that you’re not a high school graduate, even though you clearly did not, and nothing was said to you about it in over a decade, but take my word for it, it feels terrible.

Update: For those confused about college acceptance without a verifiable HS transcripts, I was told I could still enroll, but as a non degree seeking student, for only a set amount of hours, I believe. As far as the military goes, at the moment, I have requested all my paperwork on VETRECS and my transcripts to not show, only DD-214, Evals, medical reports, etc. AFVEC only appears to have my CCAF data, of which I have only completed 37 credit hours. I will call the recruiting station I went through tomorrow to see if they have access to records. 

As far as names are concerned, it shouldn’t be an issue. There where 95 students in my graduating class and not a single other person with either my first or last name.

Update #2: I have called the recruiting command who I enlisted with after high school. They confirmed they have my diploma, but not my transcripts.

Update #3: The college has excepted my high school diploma, but still waiting to see if my job will accept me into an accredited management training program without them."
269,269,Update - the current owner wants us to pay for ac unit a year after selling house,"This is the update to this post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z8ei4/sold_townhouse_a_year_later_ac_goes_out_new_owner/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I know only a handful of people will read this but I figured why not do an update. 

We were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the AC unit. The case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

What was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. Almost to the point of self righteousness. The way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. Additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. His lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. Oh well. It's over.

270,270,update - Colorado - What do I do with my house? Just leave the keys on the counter?,"I want to thank everyone for the advise on my last post and to give a brief update.  I spoke to an attorney about it and she started looking into it.  First thing she said is that I am still the owner and that the eviction process was never completed.  She also told me there's still a lien on the house, which is where it gets interesting.  

My mortgage was ultimately sold to a 2nd mortgage company which no longer exists.  The 2nd mortgage company that had my mortgage was absorbed by a 3rd company, which went bankrupt and collapsed.  Because I've been maintaining the property and paying property taxes, coupled with no leinholder asserting their rights she believes she can get the leinholder removed from the title.

So as it turns out, I may end up owning my home free and clear after all.  Unfortunately she doesn't know how long everything will take, so I don't anticipate an update for a while, but thank you all!"

Is there anything I can do to get the mistaken arrest taken off my record? I have confirmed with the police that the charge was dropped but not the arrest of it. It would be under Michigan law."
272,272,I was filmed against my consent at a party. (UPDATE),"[Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

History: Myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. In a private villa where expected things to be private. A pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. I asked if we have legal options against the person.

We went to the police. Myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. They didn't. They said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

It sucked. I didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone I know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

BUT this didn't end there. This perv didn't stop. He tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. They got him and handed him over to the police. So he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. They took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

He's now locked up. Our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

It took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him. 


"
273,273,Coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if I don't have sex with him.,"So a guy I know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. I thought I had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but I guess he somehow found the video. We work in the finance industry and I do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. The guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

This is also because I went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

So, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, I'll just call myself H, he found revenge porn of me online. At first I was relieved that it was him cause I've known him for so many years and thought I could trust him. Then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. Horrified I push him away. He then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if I come over to his place and have sex with him. Other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

We're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. That day I just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

He's told me that I should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. Over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

I feel so betrayed, since I thought we were good friends. and I'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. I've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

If anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

Tl;Dr- Coworker found revenge porn of me online. He's been sexually harassing me and Is threatening to share it if I don't have sex with him.

Edit- Many people are telling me to go to the police. It's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. He is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. He's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone I know if I don't have sex with him. 
Also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. I'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

274,274,I think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare [x-post from /r/parenting],"Originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested I post here... Edit per bot request: we are in California.

My son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. At the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because I needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

He seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.

I'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""I don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

We had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! But cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! Pretzels now!"". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". My husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (We only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

My husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

I've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.

Are we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


Edit:

First, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. We are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. We are also very grateful for all of the advice.

Second, an update. Our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. We didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. We'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. I have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

This morning my husband called CPS and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. Next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. The school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. Finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). We met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. When she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. Without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  As frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). As many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. The social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. We were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. If anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

I think that covers everything that happened today. My husband had to go back to work so I've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. If there are any developments, I'll update again, but that is it for now.

Thank you again for everything, Reddit. You truly came through in our time of need ❤️

"
275,275,Neighbor has left her 6yo daughter with me for 4 days. How to proceed?,"Let me break it down in bullet points.

\- I live in a building that has a mixture of regular and subsidized housing. About a year ago, a young mother moved in next door with her daughter. I am a 40yo man, working from home through Covid. She has confided in me that she struggles with heroin addiction, but was getting clean. I lent a kind ear and gave her a few bucks here and there. I have no interest in exploiting her. Dad is completely out of the picture. Grandparents too.

\- It started with her just 'running to the store' and leaving her child with me. That was fine. We set up a little play area and she is happy/quiet cute little girl with a good imagination.

\- There were times when she would go out and wouldn't come back for several hours. This escalated to a few times leaving her overnight. I've converted my office into a bedroom and got a bed from Craigslist. I always make sure she has breakfast, lunch, dinner and take her to the park or to the beach. Mom never compensated me, and the way she talks, it sometimes makes it sound like she's doing me a favor.

\- The thing is, I've always kind of wanted a kid but never got around to it. We have bonded. I think that this is most love and structure this girl has gotten her entire life. I've enrolled her in school this fall, which is online learning. I was able to get her social security and health information. I'm university educated and we have structured learning time. She is incredibly bright. I've also looked into getting her enrolled in dance, since she has shown an interest.

\- Mom hasn't been back in 4 days. I contacted the LL and apparently she hasn't paid rent in 3 months. Her phone has been disconnected as well.

\- I know I should contact child services, but she has grown so attached I know it would break her heart. We would both be heartbroken to have her taken away and put into the system."
276,276,Wedding photographer has been giving us the run around for 4 months. Informed us today she lost all of our images.,"I am in West Virginia. 


What on earth can I do? My wife is devestated. The photographer has lied and made excuses every couple of weeks with moving deadlines and “I sent it last week you didn’t get them?” 

We received our sneak peak, which was only like 25 pictures, but it didn’t include any pictures of the bride and her family. 

I understand a refund is a given, even though she has not offered it. (She offered a free family shoot... get the fuck out of here.)

Is there legal recourse on getting more than our refund back due to the impact this will cause and the fact we will NEVER have pictures of our wedding day?

Even the refund is going to have to go to court, I feel. The photographer made sure to mention in the apology message that she is “working 3 jobs and falling behind just trying to make ends meet.”


Edit:: hey guys. Too many replies to acknowledge. I have reached out to a lawyer. As many of you have implied, there is definitely more to this story. Something just isn’t right but I don’t know what happened on her side of things. 

She has made so many excuses along the way. She even claimed at one point that she mailed the usb drive(it never came) and when we told her it never arrived, she claimed she would have to do the work all over again but she would ASAP.

She was young and fairly cheap, but not like $200 cheap. It was around $1000 total. 

Everything has felt off the whole way (after the wedding that is. She was great that whole time) , but I never expected this 

She claims that this morning she was trying to make us a new jump drive and that’s when she realized that JUST LAST NIGHT her whole system corrupted and she most all her files for the last year. All of her projects for all of her clients. It sounded pretty insane to me, and after reading other professionals comments here, I can see it is.

277,277,"[ON CA] Mother was living in a condo I purchased. Upon her death her new husband (and his family) expect me to transfer ownership to him because ""he owns it"".","While I am not wealthy, by any means, I have been investing my extra income for many years now. As my mother was on the verge of becoming homeless some years ago, I decided to use income generated from other properties to finance a condo for her in a retirement community. She was single at the time and the verbal agreement was that she could stay there as long as she needed but she had to pay for the utilities and condo fees.

A few years ago, she married a man who promptly moved in with her. I've had a strained relationship with my mother for many years and while this man seemed nice enough, we never became close. Before they got married, they sent a note to me and my siblings stating that the marriage wouldn't change how their assets were split up upon their deaths (e.g. his kids would get his stuff and her kids would get her stuff). My siblings and I didn't care either way and just wanted her to be happy (even though she was basically estranged from all of us at that point).

Early this fall, my mother passed away. My siblings and I all did what was expected during this difficult time but it was made clear to us that the new husband was running the show. After that took place, I decided that I would wait a month or so before telling the new husband that he needed to find a new place to live as I was going to be selling the condo. Before any of this could happen though, I got a very angry call from the husband about why I was listed as the owner of my mother's residence. I tried explaining what the reality of the matter was but he was having none of it. Things have now escalated to the point that his kids are calling and sending me quasi-threatening emails.

In the last communication, they stated that my ownership of the condo is fraudulent because my mother had been making the payments on it for all these years and I tricked her into signing it over to me when it was first purchased.

Do I have anything to worry about? I'm not very confrontational but I will stand up for myself and what's right when push comes to shove. I won't be able to sell the place until it is empty which means evicting this guy but that will likely get him even more riled up which I would like to avoid if at all possible.

Thanks in advance."

279,279,[CT]. Cops keep showing up to home around 10:30PM-12AM looking for past tenant,"This has happened a few times but I work overnight so I’m usually not home around the time they come. I was home the past two times they showed up. First time, it was only two cops. Of course they knocked really hard and I live in a small community so it woke everyone up. 

Last night, I counted five cops coming to my door at approximately 11:47 PM, banging my door down, “POLICE OPEN UP”. I jump out of bed and open the door.

Some people have asked for an update so I thought I would provide one.

I ended up retaining the services of an attorney and this seems to have been the linchpin needed to get the wheels turning in my favour. Some time in mid January, my lawyer was notified that the condo would be vacated before the end of the month and they even turned over the keys through the building superintendent. 

The condo was messy / dirty but nothing was damaged. A good cleaning and some fresh paint made everything look as good as new.

The condo fees were last paid for December so I had to get that taken care of once I got the locks changed. In the end, I will be out a few months condo fees and the cost of the attorney. There are some issues with the utilities which are i) still in my mother's name and ii) in arrears by a few months but I'm told this will all be resolved quickly (and I won't have to pay for the outstanding portions).

With any luck, the unit will be sold by the end of this month (thank you hot real estate market).

Lessons learned from this ordeal; i) get everything in writing even when it's with family and ii) when push comes to shove, walk away and hire a lawyer!"
281,281,"Drunk driver drove through my friends house, almost killing her. 6 months later she has no compensation and is struggling to afford to live.","As the title says, 6 months ago it was 3am in British Columbia Canada and my friend was asleep in bed in her house she owns. A 19 year old drunk driver plowed into her house. The car went through the ground floor and she is lucky to be alive (the car demolished her bed side table, missing her bed by inches). The car couldn’t be moved for almost a month because the house may have fallen down due to how much damage it caused. My friend shared the house with her brother and disabled mother, who she is a full time career to, on top of working as a teacher.

6 months later, my friend has had no compensation. She has spent all of her life savings dealing with the repercussions. She is still paying the mortgage on her place which is completely unliveable, as well as rent on a temporary 2 bedroom place for her an her mother to live. She is having to pay contractors herself to fix the house. All of this is incredibly expensive in Vancouver Canada. She is a single salary teacher and is now having to borrow money from me in order to get by. If she didn’t have friends to support her, it’s very feasible her and her mother could be made homeless from this. The financial burden as well as the mental stress from nearly dying and then being displaced whilst having to look after her wheelchair bound mother is monumental.

The kid who drove the car is lawyered up to the eyeballs. The insurance company (ICBC) is being incredibly unhelpful, due to it being a drunk driving incident. The insurance company sent a representative to meet with my friend (I was present) and the rep admitted that, had the kid not been drunk, they would have paid out compensation quickly. Because it’s a drunk driving case they are saying the kids insurance is invalid and aren’t willing to pay out quickly to my friend.

My friend has met with a couple of lawyers (I wasn’t present) and in her words, they said she has a clear case but didn’t think they should take the case as they would charge 30% fee and they may not be necessary. This is the bit I’m unsure of, as 6 months down the line she has only been offered menial amounts by the insurance company (a couple of $1500 cheque’s, she hasn’t cashed) and her and her wheelchair bound mother are struggling to make ends meet.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I feel like this case is pretty specific to ICBC, (a particularly poorly run insurance company with a monopoly in British Columbia. Recently ICBC tried to wrongly blame the death of a police officer that was killed by a drunk driver, on the the dead police officer... just to give you a taste of how they operate)

*EDIT* 
First of all I want to say thank you everyone for all the advice, it is massively appreciated! I am currently travelling back to canada and haven’t had time to go through all of this but it seems the biggest question is regarding her home owners insurance... I need to speak to my friend to confirm but from what I remember she certainly has home owners insurance, she has attempted to get them involved but they have also been very unhelpful. They have said they won’t pay for certain things in the house, saying that even though it was destroyed, the place is over 10 years old and so the valuations are ridiculously low. They have also tried to shift the responsibility to ICBC. My friend has set up meetings with 5 different lawyers to get one of them involved ASAP. Honestly everyone, I’m blown away by all this help! Thank you. I will go though all the messages once I get back to Vancouver tomorrow and respond as needed."
282,282,"[Update] Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

Just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. The last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

I have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

My condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. Apparently there were noise complaints on Friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. Our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

On Sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were AirBnB tenants, and they said yes. He then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

Jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. She also stated that she will be going to the LTB to ""make a formal complaint because banning AirBnB is not allowed"". When i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. She went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

I have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. I asked a friend to book my room for one night through AirBnB for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment."
283,283,(OK) Mom passed away and things aren't adding up.,"[Update]

The last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  I kinda feel like I'm living in one of those crime novels. At one point, I seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility I might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

I obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but I do want to let everyone know I have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired FBI agent with a LOT of connections. As of today, I have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. I also have been granted access to her property.  A lot of things are missing.  The vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which I'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

Thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. I will never be able to express the amount of gratitude I have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. You guys are amazing!!

To those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...I hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. When you do, think of me.




I'm not really sure what to make of all this and I could really use some insight on the matter. Evidently my mom passed away last Wednesday June 5th...I say evidently because my brother and I weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

I'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and I'm afraid if I try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but I feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

We first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (See...weird huh?) He claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) She told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

My mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while I'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and I wasn't even aware he had my number. He immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last Wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. They supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. Then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and I, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend Sheriff Whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and HIS attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to Salvation Army. He was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

How is that even possible? Can he do that? I mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and I are required to attend? Is this how this stuff goes down? I really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? Never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and I can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. But my feelings aside what is the legal process here? How could I find out for certain if there even is a will? 

The situation gets a little crazier because after I called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and I are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming Wednesday because he has meetings all day Tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. To my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

This makes me think there is no will. If there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and I were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

I'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

The most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, I know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  She reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...I'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

Isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? Is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? Or even if they don't?? Sorry for the long post. I'm still trying to understand all of this. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. Who should I contact first? The police in her area? An attorney? What do I do?

Update: I can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. No I haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. He and I are getting together today to get a lawyer. This is in fact very real and I'm not making it up at all. I created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. My brother and I are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  As far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. All I can tell you is, sorry I didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. I guess I'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, I'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me."
284,284,I run a small artisanal fruit farm in France. American Tiktok influencers destroyed approximately 15% of my crop. Can I prosecute people in a different country?,"As per title, I operate a small fruit farm in France that specialises in rare and luxury oranges and other citrus fruits. These are produced in VERY small numbers, and are sold for very high prices to private buyers, restaurants, and upmarket hotels.

About 2-3 months ago about 15% of my crop had been sliced, squashed, crushed and left to rot on the ground. I liaised with local police at the time, but no one knew what had happened. The police suspected local vandals or perhaps migrants travelling North searching for some food. We have had several groups of people head towards Calais over the past few years. If the latter was the case I wouldn't have begrudged them taking some fruit. Refugees deserve to eat.

This morning I was linked to a video on Tiktok showing an American woman on my farm picking a citrus fruit off the tree, cutting it open and crushing it in her hand so the juices flowed out. Upon investigation there are approximately 4 accounts posting similar content from my farm.

It appears that they had been repeatedly squeezing my fruits trying to get a perfect shot as a girl can be seen in the background of one of the videos squeezing a fruit before lowering her camera and picking another from the tree.

Without getting into specific numbers I have suffered thousands of Euros in lost product, and thousands more from breaching contracts with hotels RE the supply of fruit.

Can I, as a European, prosecute American citizens for damages?

I have their identities from their Tiktok accounts."
285,285,School bullying issue.,"My son has been bulled every day for the past 2 years by the same boy who literally goes on a manhunt to find him and just make his life hell.

Monday the bully kicked my son in the balls so hard he was down for at least 20 mins since he wasn't in class for afternoon count and took them 20 mins to find him (there's a running track this blind spot where the teacher can't find kids)

I went to the school and raised all kinds of hell with the principle and his teacher because I've been to they school countless times to discuss the bullying problem and they just give me the bs run around saying there's nothing we can do, blah blah blah

Well i kept him out of school to recover and sent him back today and told next time they corner you over there, do the same exact thing.

And he did, and obviously I was called to school and now he might face assault charges, but when it was my son absolutely nothing happened.

Anything I can do to fight this?

286,286,"NC - Since golf course owner moved the tees my house is getting struck by golf balls constantly. There is a lot of damage (12 broken windows), multiple family members have been struck, and we can no longer sit outside safely. Can we force the owner to put up a net or move the tees?","My family has been living on this golf course for years. Everything was fine before the owner moved the tees, as the house had only been struck very rarely, but now the house is being hit at least 10 times a day. There is a lot of damage (12 broken windows, 2 severely dented garage doors, 6 plus dents in our cars, 2 seriously dented gutters, a glass door that has been broken 9 times) and family members have been hit by golf balls on numerous occasions including several near misses. After having balls narrowly miss hitting young children we no longer feels safe sitting outside during the day. We can't even use the back half of our property during business hours at all.

We have complained to the owner a half dozen times and he has made a lot of promises but never followed through with any of them. Other residents are very unhappy with the owner as he is very difficult and never follows through with anything he says he is going to do. All I was ever asking for was for him to find a way to prevent my house from being hit 10 or more times a day. Either put up a net to block the balls or move the tees back (or some other solution). I never even asked for any damages even though there are easily thousands of dollars worth of damage. I just want to be able to use my own home.

Do I have any legal standing to make the owner address this situation?"

Luckily I didn’t run them over, and I don’t see how I am at fault here. 

Their mother, came out and started screeching at me and threw more insults than I can count. She called the police and paramedics and they arrived. All of that went well, but today, a week after this happened, I got someone knocking at my door asking for my name and gave me an envelope saying I am being sued. 

I am only 18 so I don’t know how any of this works. I am waiting for my dad to get home because he works with stuff like this. 

I do not have a dashcam unfortunately. I told the police I was going speed limit, and these two kids happened to run out into the street without looking both ways, and the big SUV parked on the street was blocking my view. They dismissed me and I left, so I do not know what they said to the mother. 

But now I am getting sued, and I don’t know how to defend myself really, and we don’t have the budget for a lawyer right now. We do, but it’s not how we want to be spending money at the moment.

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

288,288,[PA] Landlord from 6 years ago is telling me he forgot to cash my rental checks. Am I obligated to send him new ones?,"My landlord of six years ago sent me a letter with photocopies of old checks I had sent him. According to him, he forgot to cash said checks and is requesting new ones. There are several checks and the total amount is not insignificant.

I'm in a fairly tight spot myself at the moment handling a mortgage, house repairs, etc. I don't see how I could pay back the requested amount without causing undue stress on myself.

Can my former landlord pursue legal action against me? Is there some sort of statute of limitations on this?

I went to the bank and they confirmed with me all checks were cashed and gave me printouts stating as such. Thank you very much for your advice."

Found out my sister contacted the police about this last night and whoever spoke with her brushed the entire ordeal off as a ""small claims court"" matter which disheartened her and my mother.

Following the suggestions from the thread, today we spoke with the deputy who was the first contact with my sister about this entire situation and he escalated it to his superior. The deputies then went to the hotel to set the manager straight. They essentially told him that he can't keep the belongings as leverage and that he'd have to pursue damages properly in civil court.

The hotel staff were very nice and understanding, but the manager's entire demeanor was extremely hostile and unprofessional. Apparently he was very rude to the officers. I did not like the way he spoke to his staff.

But we got their stuff back without any major further hassles.

290,290,TX - My pregnant ex girlfriend is told several lies about me and got me arrested. Kid was born and turns out not my kid. She just called me.,"Ex was a one night stand with no protection. She gets pregnant and we assume its mine. 

Things go to shit and we break up. Talk of custody and child support comes up and I tell her I was going to try for custody.

Three hours later I am picked up for questioning. I refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out I have a restraining order against me. 

The kid is born. DNA test is done and its not mine. 

Since all of this started I have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because CYA has literally saved my job. 

I just got a phone call from an unknown number. It was my ex. She said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. I told her we should not be talking. She agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

I immediately hung up the phone. I have her on recording admitting to false Rape reports to the police. 

Will I get in trouble for this? I made no effort to call her and she called me. The call lated 1:28 seconds and I hung up on her. 

Second question. What are the chances of using this recording to get restraining order dropped?

Third. What are the chances that Dallas police will arrest her for the false claim?"

I was going to the gym and returned what looked like a forgotten phone to the desk.

The man came looking for his phone and I told him I brought it to the front desk.

He became EXTREMELY agitated and demanded me to go get it.

When I said no, he became more enraged and threatened to beat me up.

He threatened to kill me several times.

He broke my headphones and when I approached the front desk for help he snapped my phone in half.

He threatened me several times and said he would kill me/snap my neck like the phone.

No one at the gym batted an eye, said anything or helped.

He never punched me, because I reminded him of the cameras and the police, but he was extremely imposing and like I said did threaten to assault me several times per minute.

&#x200B;

My question is should I go to the cops?

I just don't know if the Brooklyn police will do anything and I am worried that he or his friends would actually assault me should I go to the police. 

I am also worried that the front desk might give away my information to him since he is a long time member. I think they only have my credit card info, but still.

I have what I believe to be his first name."

Do i need to sign some contract to make sure it happens or does the bank automatically split the money between my parents? (Its my own account, neither are co owners).
I cant ask my parents on it, since they are in denial that im dying and refuse to talk about anything relating the fact that im dying. 
Also what about life insurance? Is it possible for me/my parents to take a life insurance on me even though its a official fact that im dying? 
I want to give them as much as i can after my death, because i know that my mom wont be able to work after my death.
Advice pls?"
293,293,(Texas) Power of attorney seems fishy?,"So, I'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time I try to, they threaten me with this. I do have mental disabilities, however I am fully functional and I also have never been diagnosed. This leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. I do remember my parents dragging me into an SSA office when I was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. They just told me to sign it without question and being my parents I didn't think to question them. Later they told me that I had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. Every time I try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since I'm disabled and I have no guardianship over myself, whoever I go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. I'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. They tell me I'm crazy and helpless and I can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200B;

Other things that might be important that make my question things:

They don't care about my well being. They don't allow me to go to therapy even when I've asked. They refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when I finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. I know for sure I do have a mental disability, I just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. They've always been controlling and I wonder if this is just another method. I get too scared to call Suicide Hotline when I'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" I've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and I have a hard time seeking help. I feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how do I go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? What are their rights if this is true? What are my rights? Can I, I guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? What can I do about this?

&#x200B;

Is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that I haven't thought about asking for? Can I do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? Can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200B;

I should also I add they sabotage any jobs I try to work because of the POA thing. I currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and I'm not on any official payroll that I know of. Is this also legal????

&#x200B;

I have so many questions and I feel so helpless and lost. I'm sorry.

Thanks in advance"

My offer letter says that I have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. It is NOT possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in California. The process takes about 4 months. I was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

I moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in October. I was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. The schedule is for several weeks ahead. I brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. I was told that I MIGHT get more hours at some point if I learn to work more efficiently.

I pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. He says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. He also said that the offer letter was void because I didn't get licensed within 90 days. He said that if I work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

Is he correct about all this? I went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 I don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. The board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

One day about a week ago she had trouble breathing and it got bad enough an ambulance came out and gave her a breathing treatment. Since then her coworker who is an older woman has been causing scenes at work about her even when she's nowhere near her. Accusing her of putting everyone at risk, and refusing to go where she's been. The manager sent her coworker home one day because she wouldn't stop. Today she found out her coworker called the CDC and reported her and has been trying to get other employees on board to get rid of my girlfriend. My girlfriend shows no symptoms.

It has been extremely hard on her since she already hates being in the condition she's in. Is there anything we can do?


Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. As of now she's filed a report with the store manager for harassment. Being a small company they don't have HR so from there there owner will be involved. Apparently they're saying the store is considered disaster relief so they are not shutting down. I will be talking to her about still taking time off though I know she's afraid of losing her job and or not being able to keep up with bills but we'll make it happen. Thanks guys!"
298,298,Planet Fitness lied...,"
Question for you guys. 

So I moved out of state but before I left I went into Planet Fitness to cancel my gym membership, signed the paper and everything. I  noticed like 3 months later that they had still been debiting my bank account, so I called my bank who said they had my account/routing number and they would block future debits and refund it. 

A month later I noticed that they had billed me AGAIN for the 3 months plus a fee. So I called my bank again who said this time they used my debit card and would refund the money and open a fraud dispute, since I cancelled it and did not permit these debits. 

Just today I got a notice of legal action from my bank with documents from Planet Fitness saying that I had never cancelled my membership, and said I went to the gym on March 6, 2020 at 12:30pm and sent a picture of me walking in dated on March 6, 2020. Mind you I have been out of state since November and the picture showed me with very short hair and I have had extensions since September 2019, they sent an old pic and are lying about me checking in. I have proof I was at work in a different state that day they claim the picture was taken. 

I am pretty positive it’ll get figured out with the bank, but my question is how could I let people know publicly about this fraudulent company without getting sued for slander or something. Also, could I sue them for blatantly lying?? 

TYIA!

Edit: Thanks for all the responses!! I absolutely have proof of all kinds on my credit card, being at work that day in another state, everything. I didn’t get a paper from the girl who did it, who seemed annoyed in the first place. But being that they now blatantly lied and I have evidence of that, their case wouldn’t stand either way. They even mailed it to my parents house, which hasn’t been my address for 7 months, and my mom was furious haha. I never thought to contact the attourney general and make sure they don’t get to keep doing this! Thanks all."

My original lease was for the first year here, after that we never signed another lease but we've never had any issues at all about that.

I've always paid the rent by making a deposit directly to his account at his bank. When anything goes wrong, he's quick to hire repairmen. We've had a good relationship for the last decade, even if we don't know what the other looks like in person.

Cue coronavirus. My SO and myself both work in the hospitality industry, and restaurant\bars have been shut down for a month now with no clear end in sight.

Edit II: I found the property tax information and it only lists his middle initial and a PO box for my state and county.

Edit III: thanks to a lot of help, some info has been tracked down and I have an address that I'm pretty sure is my land Lords actual house (not just a PO box that might not be checked often). I'm going to send a certified letter over that way explaining my situation and proposing a payment plan for deferred rent. In the mean time, I'm going to keep as much money put aside as possible until I get cash coming in again, when payments will be resumed.

I'll let you guys know if I hear back.

300,300,Ex girlfriend says she will never stop suing,"My boyfriend left his ex-girlfriend almost 2 years ago. They were together for about 5 years with no children together.  They had just purchased a home together in the U.S. and have been going to court for a year and a half over it.  He paid for almost everything,  so the court  said they must sell the house and awarded him a much higher percentage of the proceeds. She appealed on the grounds that the judge was unfair to her as a single mother (she had a 24 year old son)  and although we are still waiting to hear back,  it sounds like the court will probably stand by their original decision.  All this really did was prolong this ordeal. 
She emailed my boyfriend a few days ago and basically told him that because she can't keep the  house, she is going to sue him for multiple reasons after they finish this round. Although I don't think she will win anything, we really can't afford to keep paying a lawyer to represent him for another year or two.  He has already paid over 20k and we just can't do this much longer.   
My question is,  can she just sue him over and over? How do we handle this? His lawyer honestly has not been overly helpful.

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over. They search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. I ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that I don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

They didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

Not sure if this is legally relevant, but I'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. I also had an LSU sticker on the back of my car.

Is there anything I can do regarding this, or do I just chalk it up as part of the Alabama experience and just fly next time I need to pass through the state? I have a frontal dash cam which did not catch the tailgating behavior but can prove my speed."

Last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. On the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. This air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. This campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

As soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. He showed no remorse whatsoever. He laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

I was so furious when it happened that I didn't know what to do. I sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. I wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while I emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. But instead I  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. It's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. It's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

He clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. While everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""I heard your ears were ringing. Sorry about that."" He didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. I grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but I absolutely do not forgive him.

This happened last Saturday, a week ago. For the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. Since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. It's the worst when I'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. I hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. Sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. I think I could have permanent hearing damage.

This  guy has been giving me shit since I was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. I've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but I figured some people here might have good info as well. I won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. Any info is appreciated. Suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but I really don't care about that if I end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. It's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. Thanks for any help.

EDIT: I am seeing an audiologist and ENT this week. I will post an update here when I have one if the mods allow it."
303,303,"I missed my court date by accident, this sub prevented a major panic attack! (Arkansas)","Back in April, I got pulled over for expired tags and got a ticket for failure to register my car. I didn't know how to, but it gave me the kick in the pants to get me to the DMV. 

I swore my court date was on the 8th. I put it in my calendars. I took time from work. NOPE. It was the 6th. But I searched this sub, found out I needed to call. So I called first thing in the AM. They told me to come on Friday (today) and I could pay or I could reschedule my court date. I said I wanted to just pay and they told me my ticket would be $95. I asked if I had a warrant out because I missed, and they told me I wouldn't as long as I came and took care of it by 4:30 on Friday. 

I went in, had to wait about 20 minutes while they got all the people ready to go into traffic court. Then they helped me. I paid $95 and was only 10 minutes late for work. 

I'm so glad that there were people here to help calm my anxious nervous brain!"
304,304,Employer gave us all $0 paychecks because they haven't been doing our taxes right,"Colorado

When I got to work yesterday I was surprised by a $0 paycheck.  Apparently our taxes haven't been done right since 2015. They were just audited. Here's the note that was attached  https://imgur.com/a/yNjT4jm and my lovely paycheck  https://imgur.com/a/f1Ra4jc . This only affected the servers.  This is only my part time job, so I'm out about $100. Some of the servers though had worked over time and had $500+ checks that were zeroed. We were given no notice, and were informed that the people who had worked the most hours this year would miss another check. Is this legal? Can we do anything about this?

We give our manager a sheet after each shift showing exactly how much in tips we made. They do the claiming for us. I talked to one of the owners,  she was unaware that claiming 8% of sales was wrong and that she's been doing that for 30 years. It looks like this whole thing isn't illegal, just really shitty timing and poorly executed. "
305,305,A 15 year old girl made false allegations to CPS about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.,"My daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. I don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know I was talking about them. 

The girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... She just has delusions of grandeur). The mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

I will refer to the mother as Lorrie and the daughter as Katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

Lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying Katy. The assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss Katy. I'm not sure if Lorrie had anything to do with the CPS report but I can not contact her directly. Lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. I tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

Katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. My daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that Katy said and I advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. When the friendship fell apart, Katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. My daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

One of the things Katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and I remembered it pretty vividly. My daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

A few days ago, CPS knocked on our door while I was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what Katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. There is no one else who could have made this complaint. It was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. My husband said the CPS employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. I wasn't there so I don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

The problem is I have no proof. The assistant principal at my daughter and Katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around Katy when she made these comments about my son so I might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Do I even have a leg to stand on? All I have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

Any advice is welcome. I'm terrified.

I am in VA.

Edit: I'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. I just want to clear all of this up and I want Katy to be held accountable for making a false report. The things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. The allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. They were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do."
306,306,Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don’t think they actually took anyone’s dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I’m a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn’t know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I’m a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We’re not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I’m just dropping off a tray in someone’s room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. I guess I was acting paranoid because I was pissed about being suspected when I’ve tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


Hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. I hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she’s not here anymore, and I don’t know what is happening). Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**Edit:** I think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because I was acting like *I* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. That is some of that addict mentality, that I’m still working on with my sponsor."
307,307,Confidentiality Breach Made My Family Think I'm a Pedophile[GA],"I checked into a mental health clinic after being at a lowpoint in my life and having some suicidal ideation. I was underage at the time so it was a legal requirement I go. 

As I was being discharged, i was told I would not be going home with my grandfather or aunt and instead a DFCS (Georgia's Child protective services) would come to speak to me about group home placement. I was baffled because there's no reason that should happen. Eventually the worker decided I would go home with my grandfather, anyways. 

I learned this was because the therapist at the hospital told my family I was a Pedophile and often ""daydream of sexually assaulting children."" It was determined that I was a risk to young kids and they refused to discharge me into my family's care due to the young toddlers in the home. This is absolutely not true! During my stay, I told the therapist I often had flashbacks or nightmares about how I was raped as a toddler. I disclosed that I often thought about the violence that occurred to me during the day because I was mentally scarred. This does NOT make me a pedo.

Is it legal for her to say that? Since this, my family has isolated me, uninvited me from family gatherings and tried to put me in foster care. I am not a pedo, I struggle with PTSD from my own child sexual abuse. Once I turn 18, can I sue? What's the limitations on that? Please help."
308,308,Employer raised money on my behalf. Never received proceeds. Now laid off.,"My employer held a fundraiser on my behalf last fall when I had a major medical issue.  They solicited from a lot of my contacts, that were not aware of my condition.   This forced me to disclose to people that I would not normally care to do so.

I told my employer that I did not like the idea, but did not resist. 

I did not receive any of the proceeds, even though owner promised several times to get it to me.  Also of note, the total he told me that was raised has decreased over time.

Yesterday I was laid off.  Still, no proceeds disbursed to me.

What legal recourse can I take?  

Edit:  NC, USA

Edit 2:  thank you all so much for the responses.  I appreciate you taking the time to assist me.

I shared this post with a close friend, and they said that I should include the following info:

   I notified my employer on Friday that my condition has returned.  (My treatment team and insurance company are trying to figure out which risk is greater;  to treat in hospital, or to wait until the current crisis subsides. )  Laid off on Monday, and found out today that a part time has been promoted to full time and is doing my former responsibilities.   

I did not have health insurance  through my employer.  I was one of approximately 15 - 20 employees.

Again, thank you.

309,309,"A drunk driver hit and killed my older brother 2 weeks ago. 7 minutes prior, she was stopped by police in a neighboring city for being asleep behind the wheel and they let her go. There were witnesses to the stop. Do we have legal recourse?","Just found out this shitty news during this nightmare of my life. Like the title says. There were witnesses to her being stopped in the neighboring city. I don’t know the details - whether her car was sitting there and she was approached by police, or if she was swerving and then stopped by police. 

Either way, they did not test her, they let her go, and 7 minutes later, she killed my brother and had no injuries. 

With COVID I am sure she is going to get a plea deal for convenience and it makes my blood run cold to think that she might only get something like probation for committing manslaughter! 

This woman altered the course of our lives in the worst way. Is a civil suit against the PD possible? Is there anything we can do? We can surely sue her but if she is from around the area where he was killed it’s safe to say she doesn’t have any real money. 

We are just really lost and wondering if I can get some legal advice on this."

tldr; can i get youtube videos taken down if the guy is using my picture? there is a strange ass random man using pictures of me and implying that i am his ""ex"". to me, this is slanderous and borderline stalking. youtube ignores me. if i make a response video to expose him do i need to protect myself first (get receipts/etc) or can i just talk? i don't know how to ""prove"" my side of the story. i just want it taken down"

312,312,I (23F) genuinely think that there’s someone living in my attic.,"I’m not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. I have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

To note. The house hadn’t been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I’ve been moved in for about a month and a half - I’ve heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then I’ve just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been too scared to see if anything’s up there since I’ve moved in so I’ve never even seen the attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there’s a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn’t do anything and didn’t even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It’s a tent. There’s playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

Other than that - Do I hire someone to check the house? Do I call the cops again another day?  
Should I not stay here alone?

UPDATE: My other sisters boyfriend came over today and the two of them went up there and scooped it out. It looks like a weird grow op. Can’t can’t if anyone was there. To me it doesn’t look like it. But it’s strange regardless

313,313,Landlord's kids moved into my room during quarantine; I'm still paying rent and have to get her permission to *enter* the premises,"Hi Reddit! Long-time reader, first-time poster.

Hoping for advice on what actions I can take as a paying tenant, if any:

I'm a recent grad who rented a commuter bedroom last year to live closer to work. My lease has expired, so I've been going month-to-month. Back in late Feb/early March, my landlord (who is actually renting the place herself) asked me to **prepay 3 additional months of rent** because she needed the cash to afford her dentures. I had already prepaid a bunch of rent in January, so 3 additional months would cover me through June 2020.

Seeing that she needed help and sounded really exasperated, I took money out of my own savings account and **willingly prepaid my rent out to June 2020**. Unfortunately, a few days after that, shelter-in-place began, I went back to live with my mom, and I haven't lived in the commuter bedroom since.

This whole time, my rent was fully paid and I figured it'd be nice to still have access to the room should I need anything. However, when I asked for permission to come pick up  personal belongings a month ago (around 4/05), she asked me to ""please wait 2 weeks"" because I would be ""bringing foreign germs into the house"". Fair, since we *are* in a pandemic. So I waited.

**Turns out, her kids returned from college and fully moved in into my room during this time.** I stopped by on Friday to grab my things (medical prescriptions, retainer, etc.), and ended up moving out entirely and forfeiting my keys after seeing my belongings shoved into a corner of the bedroom I had been (and still am!) paying for. Given there was no physical space left for me to actually live there, I did not see any other choice.

After moving out, I sent her my notice to vacate (on 5/01), providing a full 30-days' notice and asked for my June rent back, in addition to my security deposit. I actually felt it was generous not to ask for March, April, and May back too - given that her kids had fully moved into the room without my knowing. She has completely ignored me.

I live in the Bay Area and work at a nonprofit, so rent is not cheap. It feels especially egregious that her kids have moved in while I continued to pay for the room *and* be told when I ""can"" or ""cannot"" enter the premises.

**Reddit, is there any recourse for this situation?**

I looked up California renter's rights, and understand that I have [rights to my security deposit back](https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-eviction-security-deposits.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en). How can I get this back now that she's gone dark on me? And what about rent that I prepaid as her kids quietly moved in and I was told not to enter the house? At the very least, I think getting June back is reasonable, as June would be *after* my 30 days' notice.

Thanks a ton in advance!

\--

**tl;dr -** Landlord's kids moved into my room during quarantine; I've prepaid rent through June 2020. We're month-to-month, so I could've cancelled anytime. How can I get my future month's prepaid rent back (would be after my 30 days' notice) and my security deposit? Can I ask for current prepaid rent too? (Given that her kids are already moved in?) Thank you!"
314,314,[CA] A friend snuck her cat into my home against my explicit wishes. My dog killed it.,"I posted an editorialized version of this in r/relationship_advice, but I’ll stick to the facts here. 

My dog is cat aggressive. Before I adopted him, he’d killed 3 cats that entered his fenced in backyard. Animal control declined to do anything about it since he was on his own property every time. Ever since I adopted him, I have been hyper vigilant in making sure he never encounters a cat, and there have been no issues. 

I live in a house I inherited, and allowed a friend “Rachel” to live with me for $300 a month. She did not have an official lease and lived with me for 5 months. About a month ago, another friend “Ashley” needed somewhere to live temporarily, and I agreed she could live with me for free for 2 months. 

I told Ashley her cat was absolutely not welcome in my home, and explained that my dog had killed 3 cats. She argued with me about confining the dog and cat on different levels of the house, or slowly introducing the cat, but I was firm that she either find other arrangements for the cat or she wasn’t welcome. All of this took place over text, so I have a paper trail.

I thought we were on the same page, but when she showed up to my house, I wasn’t home (but Rachel was) and they brought the cat in. My dog mauled it to death. 

When I got home, I was furious. I screamed at both of them to get the fuck out of my house and told Rachel her shit would be on my front lawn. I know I should not have said that, but I didn’t really put her things on the lawn, and we arranged a time for her to come collect things a week later. I’m not sure if this was technically an unlawful eviction. I did not change the locks, call the police, or otherwise try to force her off the premises. I screamed to get the fuck out and she just left. She willingly gave me her keys to the house and didn’t try to fight me on moving out. 

Ashley now wants me to pay $1500 for her to get a new cat, as she claims the one killed was a British Shorthair and was that expensive. She has contacted all my friends and family telling them about this, and has left me increasingly angry messages. 

I did have some damages to my home from the attack. 

How at risk am I for 
A) having to pay for this cat
B) owing Rachel damages for evicting her

What i’d really like here is to get a lawyer to draft up a letter to Ashley detailing that if she doesn’t stop harassing me, I will sue her for the damages to my house + the emotional distress of having to dispose of her cat’s corpse (which she left in my house). My main goal here is really just to be left alone though, and I definitely don’t actually want to sue her."
315,315,Guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. Said he’d sue me since I didn’t slow down (GA),"EDIT: Finally know everything that has occurred legally. My stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. After the officer told me I could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. Guy told him I sped up and that I was “mad he was passing me.” Said Officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. I didn’t even think he actually got it) and saw that I already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. So. The officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

My parents are furious and we’re just waiting for my day in court because there’s no evidence I sped up, there’s no dash cam footage that’s mysteriously came up, there’s nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



Hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (I have a speeding ticket but I did my time for it). I was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it’s been rainy for a few weeks and I’m also just still paranoid since my first ticket. Two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

Cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. I guess he didn’t look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. I swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. The first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

I moved on from it since I didn’t cause the accident and I went on to school. Yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying I was being faulted for an accident and that this guy’s insurance was coming after me. I was so confused because my car wasn’t damaged, I don’t need this on my driving record, and so on. My stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because I was supposed to slow down when I saw him passing. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do here. Is this a situation where I can tell him to pound sand or should I take it seriously? 

Edit: My stepdad called juvie court today and asked what I was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene I spoke to (I told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. He asked to see my license. I didn’t see why not. He basically said “Thanks for reporting I’ll contact you if I need anything else have a good day”) is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. And the reason he let me go then was because he “didn’t know I could’ve prevented the accident until further investigation.”

We’re even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we’d all just have to wait. I’m guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him I sped up or something. I don’t know what to do here because if this sticks, I lose my license until I turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket). "
316,316,"An Airbnb I recently stayed at had hidden cameras in the bedrooms, my friends and I were recorded having sex. Anything I can do to have the footage deleted?","Some friends and I met up in Southern California to have a little weekend together since we all live in different parts of the country. I brought my girlfriend with me and so did a few of my friends. The weekend went how it went and on our last day there we noticed there were small hidden cameras speckled through the home. After checking the bedrooms we confirmed there were in fact 2-3 cameras in each room all pointed towards the beds. I contacted the hosts and they stated that its their home and legally they can have security cameras in the home. Is there anything we can do to have the footage deleted or something? I understand the need for security cameras in case of damages or stolen items, but being pointed at the bed in all the rooms? It makes me feel really uneasy.

UPDATE: Made a call to the local police department, as Im already back home. Informed them of the situation and filed a report over the phone with explicit details. My friend who lives in the area is going to follow up in an hour or so after work ends for her."
317,317,Update sister took $250K from mother with dementia,"original post is nearly a year old.

Mother passed away, and within a week older sister & caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250K, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20K left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  She realized I had a good idea of the value of our mother’s estate and admitted it to me.

I tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250K would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

I filed a police report for financial elder abuse, the detective just emailed me, he subpoena’d medical & financial records, and is having sister come in for an interview in the next week.

I hope it gets resolved.  Please forgive me, since this is an active case, I don’t want to disclose the location."
318,318,"[Norway] My classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. The sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. Me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. How do I get her to give my/our money back?","Over three years ago (January 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. My classmate, let's call her Frida, received money from us and then placed the order. We were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

Long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. Frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. In August 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money ASAP. Everyone were relieved and happy. After a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. One person said she got her money (Frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. Now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

I sent her a PM the other day asking for an update. I said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. That the silence is the frustrating part. She has completely ignored it.

What can I do to get my/our money back? I thought about telling her I'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. The report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200B;

**Edit since I cant reply to people**: Thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. And you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if Frida had them a while). I do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

I'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. Norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. Since we left that school three years ago I don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. If it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

We are all spread across the country now, but I'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as I message Frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. Hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then I'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. I won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

I'm also gonna pop her then-boyfriend a message and ask him what he knows, as he's one of my best friends and might have some intel. "
319,319,NYC- I just found out when I applied for unemployment today that my previous claim was deemed an 'overpayment' and I now owe the DOL $5K. My former employer lied to get my benefits terminated. This is from 2016 am I totally fucked?,
320,320,(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

322,322,"Dog died while under sitter‘s care - story does not add up (Los Angeles, CA, USA)","My fiancé and I were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (Los Angeles, CA). We dropped the dogs off on Tuesday. The sitter informed us she was going out of town on Wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from Wednesday until her return on Saturday. She also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for “emergencies”. 

Today (Saturday) I get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn’t going to make it. I call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. He was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when I left him. 

I drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the “bite marks” he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which I immediately explain I know nothing about. They bring out my dog’s body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. I immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

Original sitter finally caves and explains that he was “attacked at the dog park” by a “pit-type dog” and she did not get the other dog owners info. Says that she didn’t tell me because she “didn’t want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal”. I ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a “No....Yes... Kind of” and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn’t want to “ruin my trip” and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

I wait for original sitter to get back to town. While outside I confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. While waiting for original sitter to show up fiancé overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying “[original sitter] told people we’ve been working together and I don’t normally do this kind of stuff but I could lose my job” - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

Original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. She cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (I have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

She tries to say it must have been a “brain disease” and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... But the vet I spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that A) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; B) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

It seems to my like the original sitter’s story is not adding up and I’m wondering if she didn’t have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. What can I legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do I have against her? I don’t even care about the money because it won’t bring my dog back, but I want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else."

324,324,"Papers served to me weren't for me; person serving demanded to see my identification, in my own backyard.","I noticed a man I didn't know standing in my backyard, which is not that unusual as there's another house back there with a separate address and sometimes sales/delivery people get confused. I asked him if I could help him and he mumbled a name that sounded similar to mine. I said, ""Yes?"" at which point he handed me an envelop and said, ""you've been served."" I've never been arrested, to court, or sued, so I read the paper and saw the name was not mine, not even close really. 

I told the man that wasnt me and he said, ""then why did you answer yes when I said your name? You've been served, you'll have to take it up with the court."" And started to walk away. I told him he mumbled, I dont hear well, and he could walk away but he hadn't served the right person because that was not me. He proceeded to argue with me, insisting I had answered to the name he said and it was up to me to figure it out. I said again, ""okay, you can leave, but I'm telling you this is not me and whomever is supposed to get it has not been served."" He then started demanding to see some ID, and I refused.

At this point, being home alone, I set the paper on the deck railing, stepped back into my house, and locked the screen door between us. Here's this stranger standing in my back yard, telling me I lied to him and I'm legally obligated to prove I'm not who I already said I was. I told him to leave or I was going to call the police myself. 

Eventually he left and I didn't have to call the police. Was I obligated to show him ID? If he comes back, can I report him for tresspassing? This is in Southern California."
325,325,"My neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. He has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else I show the house to.","I'm moving soon and need to sell my house. When my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what I would expect to get.

After I turned it down he became agitated. Since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them ALL about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". He stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

I can only conclude that he's expecting to get a cut from getting his friend the house at an extremely low price. Are there any laws against this? Do I have any legal recourse if he follows through with his threats?

326,326,[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can’t thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: “Someone I’ve never met claims they own my house”.  This is the first update, and I’m hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they’d been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner’s title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a “Bargain and Sale” deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn’t called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said “Where is the deed?”  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we’re starting to think they don’t have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who’s like “Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can’t see it.”  It’s possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it’s not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn’t been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them “You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.”
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of “Take the Lis Pendens off.” And “Ok”.  I’ll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is “Where. Is. The. Deed?”  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we’ll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that’s like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I’m not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude."
327,327,"Banned from public unuversity due to false allegations without hearing my side. Banned lifted three weeks after person reda ted all charges and admitted to lying. USA, Washington","Edit: title should say ""redacted"". Sorry for the spelling errors. I didn't spell check before posting.

Edit2: It was a female. It is a title ix investigation
I did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said I didn't have much to fight for. The ""online"" courses were not online. It meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. It wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. And even so, only one class provided me resources. The dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

I was banned from campus following allegations against me. I was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. The allegations not only never happened but I have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

I was brought into the Dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. I told them I had no idea what they were coming from and I barely know this person. They still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class. Then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. And another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. Despite this I am still ""under investigation"".

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

Because of this I have no school and no job.

The university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

Do I have any rights whatsoever??? I'm out a job. Thousands of dollars and school."
328,328,"My truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. [WA state]","My truck (‘87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid October. I immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

Fast forward to last Friday, I receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... On November 1! Six weeks prior! From my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

I called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. A later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which I would think is illegal. Apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but I had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. I had no idea it had even been recovered!

All I really want is my truck back, which I don’t think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. Am I entitled to compensation? And from whom? The towing company sold it before it’s stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. Do I have legal recourse here?

I have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their “complaint hotline” until tomorrow. Same situation with the towing company.
Any advice greatly appreciated."
329,329,Brother's friend wanted a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes and a bed' while he moved back with his parents until the covid crisis is over. My house is now packed full with urine-stinky furniture. What can I legally do with it? Country NSW Australia.,"I get on OK with my brother, and his friend hadn't shown any hint of being an idiot over the last 15 years so I went along with this. I'll call my brother's friend Doug.

My brother phoned me a while back and asked if I could do a favour for Doug and he put doug on, and doug told me he's gotta move back in with his parents because he lacks work like all of us, and needs a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes full of clothes, and a bed' for about six months until things open up again. My brother told doug I had a spare room with not much in it (which is true), and I was happy to help so I said sure, bring it over. The spare room is more than big enough for a couple of wardrobes and a bed.

Through miscommunications and a shift change at work I couldn't be there when doug moved out of his old place and put his stuff in the spare room, so I dropped my spare key to my brother and he supervised doug. on Friday afternoon I came back home to a house packed full of what looks like every possession doug has ever owned packed into every room of my house, and almost all of it is urine stained and covered in mouse droppings.

""A couple of wardrobes full of clothes and a bed"" has turned into two wardrobes full of mouse droppings clothes and boxes, a dozen garbage bags of more clothes, six chairs and a kitchen table, a bedside table, a dozen boxes of books, two bookcases, boxes of kitchen implements, half a dozen wall hangings and paintings, a house door covered in stickers, a credenza, a single bed and a double bed (both of them REEK of urine and bloke), four small chests of drawers, three kitchen cupboards, a pair of card tables, and two refrigerators with food in the freezers and plugged into my power, and more bags of bedclothes, electronics, just about everything to fill a regular small house.

Everything in the house stinks and I can't do this. I don't mean it just has a scent to it, it stinks badly. I can taste the stink in my mouth even when I'm out of the house. With the heater on now it's winter it's nauseating.

I phoned doug and told him he has to come and get this all out, and he can't. He's already 600km away on his parents property and has no money left. I told him I'm going to dump the lot of it if he doesn't come get it, and he told me I'd made a binding verbal agreement with him and if I damaged anything of his he'd come down on me like a tonne of bricks with legal action. ten minutes after getting off the phone with him, his dad phoned and made more threats the same.

I can't reach any of the shelving in my spare room, I can't use half my couch or my art desk, I can only JUST reach my own clothing in my bedroom drawers and I can only use one chair in my kitchen.

I've contacted my brother and a stupid shrugging noise and said he thought that's what I agreed on.

What am I legally allowed to do with all this? I agreed to a couple of wardrobes and a bed. I did NOT agree to a house full of stuff. I want to at least get the worst of it out of the house immediately but it's been raining and we have a week more rain forecast. I can't afford to put it in storage, I'm slowly draining my savings the last few months as work has been cut back due to covid. I don't have a garage or shed, I have no undercover place to put any of this. Best I could do was borrow a tarp and wrap up the worst wardrobes and clingwrapped the beds but that's only a minor help as it all smells bad.

I did a house plan drawing, sorry it's rubbish. on the left is my normal house, TV is the lounge, S spare room D desk room B bedroom and K kitchen. on the right is the same with all of doug's stuff added in red. https://imgur.com/a/I0eXuDz

Edit: ok this has gone beyond legal advice and beyond a joke I think, I just went around taking photos and doug has a dried up used cat litter tray in the bottom of his wardrobe underneath clothing, the bags of clothing have mouse nests in them, and there are cockroaches. I've phoned friends, we're dumping it on the front lawn tonight (it's 1130pm here) and I'm texting doug's parents with the photos and if they want any of it they'll come get it. I'll deal with the consequences of that later, my sanity and sanitation is worth more."

When I arrived in court and spoke to the prosecutor she told me this would result in points on my license. It was then I brought up the fact that the wording of the ordinance specifically and exclusively refers to ""scooters"". She then left and came back 2 minutes later. I was told to request to have the officer present for questioning I think. The prosecutor said that I need to ask the officer what I was riding when he pulled me over and that if he says ""skateboard"" that I'm home free.

331,331,Won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while I was in high school. They said I had to wait until college to receive the money. The organization is shutting down. Can I do anything to still receive my money?,"**location:** I live in Rockville, Maryland, and the organization is based in Rowland Heights, California (I believe)

Basically, I won this high school gaming tournament where the winners were promised $2000 college scholarship money. The other winners (my teammates) started college in previous years and have already received their money.

I only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. They gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (WTF?). I suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. Their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

There was no written contract, but the money was promised. They also made a Facebook post after the tournament saying ""Congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

Thanks in advance! This is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: to make it clear, this is a small organization, not a big company

edit: I have been contacted by the organizers and they claim they are working on it right now... I think I will still pursue action, especially if they don't give me a definite response on when I can receive my money.

edit2: They told me """"within one month"""" to ""verify"" my identity as a student. I have already provided the information, I'm thinking that if they're not ready to send the check within a few days then I will get legal involved.

332,332,Just found out that a warehouse is being built on land that I own. I was never told about it and didn't sell my land to anyone.,"I own property in North Carolina. It's a piece land of on the outskirts of a town/small city that's slowly expanding. It used to be farmland, and there was an old house of little value. I live out of state and have not visited the place in 8 years. No one has been living in the house for the last 18 months. After all this time I just went to have a look at my property.  I was in for a quite a shock as I arrived where my house used to be: the house has been torn down, and there is a construction crew working all over my lot. They said they're building a warehouse and offices. There's a huge hole in the ground. As I was there there were 2 excavators digging further into my land. A small hill that there was was flattened.

I couldn't believe it because I've not been told about my land being used for construction, ever. I haven't sold my land or the house. I've never been called by anyone seeking to buy it.  As I was driving there I noticed that the city has expanded and there are now buildings much closer to my land than ever before, but I had no idea that my own land was being used for development. This is so crazy. I can't believe I'm even typing this. I've paid the property tax on this lot every year. It's my name on the title. I'm livid, my land was taken from me without anyone telling me about it.

I want to make the construction crew stop working on my property immediately. Then I want someone explain me how this could happen, and of course get appropriate compensation from whoever is responsible. Where do I start? How do I make them stop? I tried talking to the workers but they wouldn't listen.

Edit: I get it, I'm getting a lawyer.

Edit 2: and now the GIS website says it's no longer under my name. This is so f...ed up. I have no words. I've paid the taxes every year. How does this even happen? How do they send me taxes for property they don't think I own?

333,333,"Pharmacy gave my controlled substance prescription to someone else. Refuses to admit they were in the wrong, refuses to refill my prescription, refuses to tell my doctor they screwed up, and is telling me they cannot help me until they do a month long investigation.","I take a medication which is considered a controlled substance, if i don't have my medication i struggle to function properly. I go to a common pharmacy chain in Ontario, Canada. 

Last Monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

On Wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. After taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance Tuesday afternoon. I denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in Thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

Thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* Insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. Which i denied repeatedly.
* I told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* Now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. I told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. Who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* Unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. Which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* I called my Doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. The head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. He told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* The head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

I went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. They agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

On Friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance.

(PA),"I got a lot of good advice so I just wanted to thank everyone and let you know what happened.  I went back to the station and managed to talk to a police officer who was actually interested in doing his job. I showed him the texts, the conversations with the coworker, and copies of the vet bills. He went to have a chat with this coworker, and she voluntarily gave the kittens up. My cats are home safe! She did deny that she paid for them when talking to the officer, but I don't know what to believe. 

Someone did suggest on my post that I go through my belongings to see if my BIL had stolen anything else. It turns out some stuff was missing, though nothing too precious because we didn't notice it missing right away. Still, I believe we will be pursuing this with the police as well.  "
335,335,(Update) Cease and Desist letter after posting a review on YT and tricked by developer for address/name,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

So it's been an interesting two months, after my post I started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

I finally found an attorney that understood what I was talking about and wanted a link to the Reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice I received. 

He accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist I received and a few possible future letters/calls.

He responded asking them exactly what statements I made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. Since I previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

He also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between QA, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

It also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that I still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

Also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. He also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between QA, developers etc.

So after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. Nothing for about a month but then I received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom PS4 limited edition console, bobble heads, Funko pops, just every piece of swag I think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""Sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

My attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

He sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. They sent out a check for $500 and some papers I needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and I won't sue them.

Thank you LA, I didn't get sued and after it all I came out ahead. I'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!"
336,336,Rear ended by a cop who pressured me not to report it [MA],"This is happening right now. I work at a dog daycare and was driving a group of pups back from the dog park, going the speed limit, when a car bumped into me. Turns out it was an unmarked police vehicle. Since I’m at work, I asked if I could just photograph his insurance information and file a claim later. He said that since he’s police I would need to stay and wait to file an accident report. 

He kept emphasizing that this would be a long process, that the damage wasn’t that severe, and that I should let it go. He also tried to accuse me of speeding, which I wasn’t—this happened maybe 50 yards past a crosswalk at which I had stopped, so I don’t even think it’s possible for me to have been speeding unless I had floored it. It made me uncomfortable that he was so adamant about me not filing a report, like maybe this isn’t his first accident, so I went ahead with filing it.

What should I expect to happen next? Is it true that he wasn’t able to just give me his insurance so I could have moved on with my day? Can he make this out to be my fault somehow? Am I owed any compensation from him personally or from the police department for the rest of my shift I’m likely going to miss?"
337,337,[Update] They removed all the cats from my mom's house.,"Animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. Over the weekend I took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that I cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. She also thanked me for getting her a new bed. She couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house. 

 Animal control, with a lot of help confiscated all the cats except two, and all of the birds. For those debating it, no it was not a swan, but a young duck. I should probably have known, but I wasn't going to take a second peek into that room. The total cat count was 213, and the total bird count was 87. There were a significant amount more that were, unfortunately, dead. Many of the cats were sick, and may have to be euthanized.

My mother is extremely upset, she has been admitted to the hospital for reasons I would rather not get into. I don't know if the house is saveable, the situation is still being assessed. I'm sorry it's not a happy update, but at least I'm no longer drowning in cats."
338,338,Drive-in theater neighbor telling us we can't watch,"Location: Indiana

My grandparents own a house that borders a Drive-in movie theater. They have lived here for over 20 years and the theater has been here longer than that. They have a pool with a raised deck, and you get a perfectly clear view of one of the movie screens from it. So ever since the theater changed their sound to FM, it was always family tradition to have movie nights on Grandma and Grandpa's deck, along with a bbq and the pool.

Anyways, this past weekend a few of us family members were over and we had our chairs out on the deck and grandpa had burgers on the grill. We were about ready to watch the movie when the owner of the drive-in came to the edge of the property line and told us the movie was for paying customers only. This left us quite perplexed and in order to avoid any confrontation, my grandparents cancelled movie night.

My question is, does the Drive-in have any authority to tell us we can't watch? It's not like they're losing any money by us viewing it, they put the sound over the free FM radio, and we aren't tampering with any fences or trees that might be blocking the view.

Edit: Please stop sending me PMs asking which drive-in this is. I will not dox them or us."
339,339,(MA) My elderly father was laid off in a position elimination three weeks ago. 24 hours ago they posted that they are hiring for the same position.,"(Massachusetts)

Hi all,

Need a bit of guidance here. I am writing this on behalf of my dad.

Three weeks ago, he received a call from HR letting him know that he is being laid off due to his position being eliminated. I work in HR, and probed him for a bit more info - he forwarded me the emails from his HR rep, which indicated that about 80 employees were impacted. My dad just turned 65, and the other employees impacted that he is aware of are older.

I asked him to ask his HR rep for a list of impacted ages and positions. Based on the information provided from him, it seems his HR Dept would be required to send this over according to the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. The HR rep explained that this wasn't a large-scale layoff, and that each layoff was an individual situation (unsure what this means) and that this was a position elimination. He asked her again through email and she again said no.

About an hour ago, we saw that his position (incredibly similar yet reworded) was posted. He signed his severance agreement two days ago, and it appears that it was posted immediately following. He has seven days to retract his agreement. If it's relevant, my dad was basically a superstar at his job and received glowing performance reviews.

Really looking for advice here. My dad is at a loss. Thank you.

Edit: We will be reaching out to lawyers tomorrow. Thank you to everyone that contributed and continues to contribute, we appreciate all the advice that is coming in. And thank you to the kind soul for the gold, which my dad is ecstatic about (he is not familiar with Reddit) - I let him know that someone liked his post so much that he received a gold medal and he keeps asking me about it. So thank you for making his day, especially during a stressful situation.

Edit 2: thank you everyone for the well wishes and the advice. The majority of support here has been overwhelming.  We have been in touch with a local lawyer and I will update in the future once we come to a resolution."
340,340,"My sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. Now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to Canada. Is this legal..?","I am in **Ontario, Canada** while my sister was in Vancouver BC.

My brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. He is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

Nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). In agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

My sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. She asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. I agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

One month turned into two, and then finally 4. She kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in Europe to visit her fiancee's family. When she got back she would let me know. Then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. Never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

Finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* She isn't coming back to Canada, as she has decided to get married in Europe and live there with her fiancee.
* She isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* She said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

She has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

I know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. I can't take care of my brother anymore. On top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

I have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. I was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

So like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? Isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? I know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

To clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. We have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. To the point where i worry for our future. I can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question. "
341,341,"Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","Mostly what's in the title. Condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. Upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. Tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. About an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. All $1 of it. He told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

Our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. The police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. The condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as I plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

To me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but I am nowhere near a lawyer. To that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but I am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

I have no idea what to do here. Luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. Unluckily, my wife and I turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

I'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. Beyond that, do I have grounds to evict him? If so, how do I recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? Does the tenant have any sort of liability here? If I do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can I sue the seller for that as well? What about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? Is there anything else that I am not thinking of?

I am shaking with anger right now so I apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Edit: Location is New York, specifically Putnam County.

**Update (4:45PM):** I just got a call from my attorney's admin. He's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. Apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. Needless to say I am looking forward to hearing from him.

**Update 2 (5:25PM):** Just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. The evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. We're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). I'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for the advice and reassurance. Wish me luck!"
342,342,TX - Update. I informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.,"Met up with him after work and got right down to it. I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

343,343,UPDATE: Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"Delaware, USA

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

I found the fence on Thursday. Saturday I was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. So on Friday morning, I had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. I called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

I took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

I also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. If I find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, I'll be informing the police.

So, on Friday afternoon, I removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which I put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

We still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now I don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. I will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

Thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if I learn who built the fence I will be sure to update again!"
344,344,My Brother used my name in a traffic stop,"Location: Vermont

My wife and I received our auto insurance renewal and noticed a huge increase in our premiums. I saw the word ""citation"" next to my name in the insurance paperwork. I haven't had a speeding ticket in over 10 years.

After calling insurance, DMV, and the Judicial Bureau I was able to get a copy of the ticket that was issued back in July. The ticket was for a 52mph in a 35mph zone in the next town over from where I live. The ticket was contested and the defendant never showed up to court. It turned a 100 dollar ticket into a 250 ticket.

Turns out my Brother, who hasn't had a license in over 10 years, was driving my parents car and gave my name to the officer when he got stopped. This isn't the first time this has happened and I honestly don't know how he can get away with it.

I'm currently at risk for losing my license for the unpaid ticket and am now paying hundreds more for insurance.

What is my next step? The issuing officer no longer works for that police department and I want to press charges and get reimbursement if possible.

Thanks"

After completing depositions and discovery, we were able to settle. It was an extremely difficult process. A little advice: treat your work email like it is public record, because it is.  Even though it was hard, I am really happy I went through with it. I am happy with the settlement and happy I got to make their lives difficult for a year.  I am using part of my settlement to buy my daughter a small memorial in a public park.

Today they were forcefully removed from the property by the police. Our lawyer was somehow able to get a judge to look at everything and approve having them removed. The police officer basically told us to not move in and have the entire house professionally cleaned, as there is a bunch of needles and other things laying around.

On top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. All the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. In some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. Basically our house I guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

Our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. I wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

I purchased a car Saturday in Massachusetts. I paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. Upon pickup on Tuesday,  I was told I was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that I was not entitled to. The dealership told me I need to pay $500 or else I can't have the vehicle. At this point, I already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything I needed aside from registration. As far as I was concerned it was my property at the time. After a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would F me up etc etc. After threatening me, I told him he couldn't do that. He then rushed me and violently pushed me . At that point, for my own safety, I tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. During the separation he hit me several more times because I was the only individual restrained by the other employees. The other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. The police were called and I filed a report. I have yet to request the police press charges. I declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. I had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated VIN.  Police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. If I requested the charges be pressed I couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  I sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed.

352,352,[FL]Car dealer threating to sue me because I paid off the loan immediately after buying the car.,"Long story short, I have excellent credit (800+). Recently bought a 1 year old car. Dealer did not allow outside financing, must finance through the dealer. I played dumb, got them to eat all dealer fee's, and before I signed on the dotted line I asked if they could take a bit more money off the car for a higher interest rate and a longer loan term. They said yes no problem. They gave me a rate of 7.99% for a term of 84 months. I bought the car, and drove off. The next day I went to a credit union, got 2.75% for 48 months, put some cash down with the credit union on the loan, and refinanced the car. That entire process took roughly 10 days as the bank that originally financed the loan didn't have the payoff amount available immediately. 2 months later the car dealer caught wind of what I did, and called threating to sue me for 3K in lost ""revenue"". There was no language in original loan contract regarding any kind of pre payment penalty to anybody. I could have paid of the entire loan to the original bank on day 1 with cash according to the contract, which, is what I basically did, except I just refinanced instead. The dealer is claiming I defrauded them by asking for a higher interest rate up front for more money off the car. I haven't been served yet, but I have been getting a LOT of nasty emails and messages on my voicemail. I'm fairly certain I can tell them to eat shit, but I wanted another opinion. Thanks!"

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

356,356,Update-I need more help. My ex deleted my BA thesis and it’s due in 7 days,"I need additional help. Based on the advice from my last thread I took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. They said I’d have it back by the end of the week. That would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

I got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. Tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

I’m not looking for technical advice. I need legal advice that I can use for my college and ex. My advisor said he can’t give me an extension, which means I won’t graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. Is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? My paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. Plus my backups were deleted. This whole situation is beyond my control. 

Is there any action I can take against my ex?

For the bot: I’m in Illinois. 

Edit:

[This is my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b856m5/my_ex_deleted_my_ba_thesis_and_underlying/). Basically, my roommates and I had a party on Sunday. My ex showed up which is not unusual because we were on good terms and her friends are friends with my roommates. My computer was available for people to play their own playlists. Again, nothing unusual. I woke up on Monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where I made weekly backups of my thesis). When I checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. I freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

Texted my ex later on Monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn’t hear back. Her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. She did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

I have a fellowship lined up after graduation that I’m not eligible for if I don’t actually graduate. I need an extension until I get my files back. I’m completely completely screwed if I can’t turn in my thesis. "
357,357,[Update] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.

Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)

The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state."
358,358,California. Can my ex force his religion onto our minor child?,"Me and my ex are both Muslim, and neither of us are practicing. We're divorced, mostly because of his strict cultural believes ( I'm American, he isn't). He was forcing me to wear headscarves and not work. When I took it off and got a job, he divorced me. 

My daughter is 3 years old and he's already telling her she can't do this or that ""because she's a girl and girls don't do that"". I always tell her the opposite because I think gender roles are unhealthy. 

She was in a toddler soccer team and he stopped taking her because he says it's for boys. I also wanted to put her in the toddler dance classes and he said only whores dance and he forbid it.

He is already forcing her to cover up and I always take it off of her, which starts a huge fight. He says his daughter will wear hijab and not be ""a whore"" and I tell him she doesn't have to wear anything she doesn't want to. 

She's obviously confused who to listen to.

My question is if he's legally allowed to force his religious practices on her against my wishes?

Edit - Please stop spamming my thread with religious advice. I'm seeking secular, California LEGAL ADVICE ONLY. I already know the rulings. You are going to get my topic closed with your off-topic spam. Thank you for understanding."
359,359,[UPDATE] Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? Oregon,"Previous post a month ago [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

I'm safe, and I'm out.

I organised a place to stay with a coworker. I have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. My dad has some regular sport meetings on Saturdays that go for hours so I prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. I've been approved for a rental and I move there soon.

I contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when I told them he'd been telling me I couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

I took copies of all of his paperwork too because while I was getting ready to move I found most of what I knew about my parents separating was a lie. There was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. My dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when I was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. He's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when I'm 21. Some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. I think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. I did not find the letter I read when I was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

After I moved out my dad did try to contact the police. They came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say I couldn't look after myself. His words were that I was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

I've been back to Canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. We're still working out the details with a Canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but I have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people I remember. They were really worried about me when I went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

Thanks for all your help, your comments gave me the confidence to act."
360,360,"Hunters shot house again, broke window","My parents live in a rural area and are surrounded by woodlands that they do not own. A couple years back a hunter shot in the direction of the house and broke a window. The cops came out, the hunter apologized and paid for the window, but nothing really came of it.

Now it’s happened again (different window, same scenario, possibly different hunters-not sure). The hunters are friends of the guy who owns the land, and the owner is upset (as he is also friends with my parents), but I feel like that isn’t enough. What can/should be done?

361,361,I went on a 20 day trip. I came back to find squatters in my home. They (falsely) claim to have been there for 6 weeks. Do they have tenants' rights?,"I own a house in Orange County, California. I went abroad for 20 days. When I got home at the end of that trip, I found my locks had been changed and someone else's car was in my driveway.

I called the police. That led to an argument with the people (at least 2 adults) occupying my house. They told the police they'd been there for 6 weeks. I explained I knew that to be untrue because I was only gone for 20 days. At the end, the officers said it's a civil matter and left.

So basically, these people have been in my house for no more than 20 days, but they claim to have been there for long enough to be tenants. Do I need to treat them as tenants?"
362,362,"A bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.","Basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

EDIT: The bot asked me to include a location so uhhh i guess Jersey? Kinda don't wanna get more specific than that."
363,363,Parents took $6000 from me without my consent. Resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.,"I live in Alberta, Canada. About a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. I was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

My father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. At the time, I didnt mind since I was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason I gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. Hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

All was fine until a couple months later when I decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

The tap function was on the card.

I confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. However, this only happened for three months. Around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. Due to a plane ticket I bought to see my gf this August as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, I was left with about $1000. However, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

I burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. While I was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

I had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. I was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. A couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

I lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. What should I do? 

UPDATE: After seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, I decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while I get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. Thank you all, I never thought this would blow up like this when I went to sleep last night. Knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than I did before.

You see, I have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement I was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as I found out just now during the moving preparations. It's still $500 cheaper than the room I paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. If you guys have any more advice, I'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation. "
364,364,Update!!! -My landlord called the cops on me for trying to pay my rent- cop made her let me pay- now I'm being evicted for non payment-Texas,"Thank you all so much for all the wonderful advice!!! I definitely feel more educated and informed about my rights now. 

I'm no longer being evicted and I got all of my late fees back as an account credit, except for $5, but at this point I don't even care to ask why.

 I used the property records to hunt down their main office in Houston(I live in Dallas) and forwarded them the same email outlining all the ways they had violated my lease that I had sent to the TAA, the City, as well as the apparently pointless (thanks, guys) BBB.

The guy there got me set up with the online payment system that they actually DO have, contrary to what the office manager here told me. Next month I can just pay online!

He went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. I actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court. 

I also now have the contact information for a pro bono place that specializes in housing, just in case I ever need it. 

Thank you all so much for the overwhelming amount of responses and information <3"
365,365,Company refusing to allow me to take personally owned tools home.,"I am from Illinois USA.

366,366,Wife’s girlfriend retracted my son’s foreskin and it got infected; my wife didn’t take him to the doctor and I found out only after witnessing his infection myself,"So my wife and I separated five months ago and she moved in with her girlfriend she was cheating on me with that led her to discover she wasn’t straight but lesbian. I should start off by saying this woman always gave me bad vibes, mainly because she is ditsy and irresponsible and avoids taking responsibility.

Anyhow. My wife has had our son the last few months during quarantine. Now that summer is coming and some states are starting to return to somewhat normal, I asked her to return him to me for some visitation. We are NOT divorced and as such we have no official custody agreement.

Honestly my hope was that my wife would realize she missed me and our marriage and would come home but now I am preparing to finally let go.

Anyways I went to pick up my son and took him home. I had to change his diaper and right away I noticed that his penis was very infected and swollen and abnormal looking.

I immediately phoned my wife and asked her what happened to our son.

She confessed that a few days earlier, her girlfriend volunteered to give him a bathe because my wife was really tired after a long day’s work (she is a substitute teacher and works night shifts in a warehouse).

Wife’s girlfriend has never cared for a child before let alone a boy let alone an uncircumcised boy, so she had no idea what the protocol was.

Apparently she googled how to clean under foreskin and stupidly read to pull it back and wash it with soap and water. Well that’s what an adult might do, but baby boys have their foreskin attaches to the glans. During or after puberty, the boy should be the first one to pull it back as part of exploration.

Anyway, she did pull it back and scrubbed it really hard because she thought it was so dirty it stuck together. Again this woman is an IDIOT.

My wife since then has just been putting Vaseline and neosporin instead of taking him to a doctor!!

I immediately took him to an urgent care center and they told me that he has an infectious growth there that needs to be treated with antibiotics.

I am so angry that my wife let this happen. She basically agreed to let her circle fiend who has zero child care experience bathe my son which led to his current serious injury.

What I’m wondering is would I be justified in keeping my son indefinitely while I begin working with my lawyer to draft a divorce agreement?

I also don’t want this woman (the girlfriend) ANYWHERE near my son whatsoever even if she gets partial custody. And would be I be a jerk if I used this incident as evidence of negligence? I recorded the whole conversation where she admitted to me what happened (and yes it’s legal to do so where I live).

Please help me think this through because I am incredibly frustrated!!! And angry! My poor son :(

367,367,I’m being sued by the at fault driver who doesn’t know I have dash cam footage,"Hello, 

I got hit in Brampton, Ontario in October 2018. 

I’ll try to keep it short! Last October a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as I started going through the green. 

I called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. No one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. They didn’t ask questions or care. No ambulance came, no major injuries. 

The insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as I was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). No issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that’s it I moved on. 

Fast forward about 5 months and I received mail that I believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what I believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

Her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. It doesn’t make any sense as she wrote “he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light” 

The funny thing is, I don’t think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. This footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as I’m moving forward at the green. All very clear on the footage. 

My question is, how can she sue if she’s at fault? I’m sure I’ll win a case with the footage I have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? That’s what I’m most worried about. 

Any thoughts on this situation is helpful. 

Thanks"

You guys are good it was indeed a scam as some of you said! So I took the letter to my manager and we went to the general manager's office. Seems like everyone (my manager, coworker who was on the same shift) received the same letter. They said not to worry and go back to work they will handle it, at most I'll be asked to give a statement but I won't be liable for anything.

Then they pulled the security tapes, by luck they keep them for long, and they were quite interesting. They even called me so we could have a good laugh. So this lady and her husband had been at our store and bought two full carts of groceries. They both were pushing a cart and for some reason the guy wasn't able to control his and it started taking speed (parking lot has a slight slope) and hit the woman. She fell hard on her ass, must have hurt. She had a hard time getting back on her feet so maybe she was injured for real and that's where the medical bills come from? Anyway. She went back to their car and half an hour later back into the store. Then she literally flew herself to the ground when she passed the section I was cleaning. That was quite an artistic ""fall"". Then of course she starting yelling and everything. So yeah, a scam alright, but maybe the injuries were real. It sucks that she got injured but it's really scummy to try and scam minimum wage workers who don't have money to throw around. I don't get why people do that. I must say I was quite scared before you people gave me advice, thanks a lot for your help."
369,369,URGENT! My boss threatened to fire all staff for unionizing for wanting safer conditions and I think he's going to follow through later today. Can someone explain difference between non-recall and termination as it applies here? NY,"Hello. I've been organizing my coworkers in union activity in an effort to get safer working conditions (and maybe higher pay) when we, a retail business, reopen after COVID-19. We don't feel like our safety concerns were taken seriously or that they were willing to budge on some important parts of our requests. This business is a small chain with a corporate structure above us. Our demands were sent to the higher ups after our boss freaked, and I don't think enough was done and neither do any of my coworkers who have participated. We were told that they ""are aware of \[our demands\] and will address them when the time is right."" After our demands they very suddenly decided that they are going to reopen this Saturday, the 30th. Without discussing doing more about worker safety concerns than the half assed nasty email that was sent. About half of the staff at this store has an underlying health condition, and imo, they have offered the bare minimum if that.

 I have educated myself and my coworkers about the National Labor Relations Act and that we should be protected should we unionize. That seems like the direction it's going. Shit is going to hit the fan TODAY. He privately emailed a coworker that if I (serious health condition) or another coworker (also with a serious health condition, but has another job and may just leave this one) didn't agree to work a specific shift he will have considered us all to quit and will replace all staff. We have been clear that we ARE willing to work, just with better conditions. We have been clear that we do not want to quit. I reference the NLRA a fair bit in the email and make reference to the ADA (he's not willing to make reasonable accommodations for those of us at higher risk). But the part about ""considering us to have quit"" is throwing me. Can someone explain non-recall and termination as it relates here? I have been referred to a local law service, but I do not know how long that will take. A similar organization (unrelated COVID crisis, yay me) referred me to a lawyer within the same organization who doesn't practice employment law so she was unable to answer some of my questions and I do not know how long it will take me to get put in touch with an employment lawyer, but I have to send this email TODAY. 

All help is appreciated, TIA!

370,370,"Someone has spent the last few days submitting copyright claims on almost all of my cosplay/art. I am lost, and don't understand what is going on.","Hi,

In the last few days i have received thousands of messages from various different sites i post pictures/videos to claiming it was removed due to a copyright claim. Pretty much every single photo, original art, or video i have ever done has ether been hidden, or outright removed.

Everything from cosplay photos, to art i drew, to a random video of me drunk with friends from 3 years ago that i posted to my instagram. I don't understand.

Most of the stuff removed says it was removed via a DMCA claim, while Instagram/FB says it was removed due to Copyright Infringement.

Some of the notices reference a person who is doing the claim, i have no idea who this person is. Other ones reference a company in China, and yet again i have no idea who they are.

Some sites want me to submit a counter-DMCA claim, but give me very little explanation as to what that is. While some other sites provide a way for me to file this counter claim however i am required to provide all of my personal information including my address which makes me extremely uncomfortable.

A few of these sites seem to have terminated my account due to the number of infractions.

I am really confused right now, can someone give me some advice as to how to handle this? I don't really understand what is going on, and considering the sheer amount of these things can i just cut my losses and ignore some sites?"
371,371,I'm a pedestrian who waved in an SUV in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.,"This happened a few days ago. I live in Philly and I was walking along a busy street and I see this SUV at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. There is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. The SUV wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. I saw that he did and I just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. He ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb I guess and turned at the last second). 

They got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim I think. I didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since I saw the whole thing. They both shared each others insurance and ID.

The SUV guy asked me for my ID for witness too for his insurance claim. Soon after he took a picture of my ID on his phone he said I was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. He is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. I felt bad because I gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he DID turn at the last second. The other guy was also annoyed that I shouldn't have told him to go. 

He called and left a VM that I need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. He said that if I agree to pay I can just pay half of the damages.

I'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and I don't want to go to court. If it goes to court will I have my credit ruined? Sorry I don't know too much legal stuff!

Edit: Now he is saying that my future will be screwed and my credit score is going to be messed up and that there is a possibility that I may be criminally convicted?? I am an immigrant here on a visa and I am worried that it's going to affect me!

Edit 2: Hey guys, thank you so much for your support! This has been really helpful. However, I am getting conflicting advice here. Some are saying that the other person (SUV guy) has a case and it seems like there have been cases similar to this. Some are telling me that I am absolutely guilty and should have everything taken from me! Also I am not sure who Ayan Rand (legal author?) is and how this affects me? I spoke with a legal hotline service and they said that they are not sure of the laws but I need to get a notarized letter from the SUV guy saying that i won't be sued if I choose to pay. I am honestly super scared and stressed that my immigration status will be affected (like the guy said). Should I be contacting immigration lawyer too?"
372,372,"[Manitoba, CANADA] (UPDATE) My cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.","Previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting nasty messages, I figured I should edit this to let everyone know that I have finally convinced my cousin to report him. He will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is Saturday. We are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. Also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of June 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

There you go folks. Please stop insulting my cousin and I."
373,373,Divorce agreement states that I get to claim our children on my taxes but she has contacted me saying I can’t and wants me to refile for the last five years so she can claim them.,"We live in Western New York and while the backstory to why is a bit long and drawn out, though not pertinent to the situation at hand, according to our divorce agreement that was signed in 2014 I get to claim our children (there are four children) on my taxes each year even though I’m the non-custodial parent. Her financial situation as far as I know is that she doesn’t work and only gets my child support and disability checks as she has epilepsy.

This week with the Covid-19 stimulus going on she apparently started looking into tax return law and found out about form 8332 and is now wanting me to re-file my last 5 years tax returns so she can file and claim our children. I was vaguely aware of the form, but mostly in that when filing (on TurboTax) it would mention either needing that or an agreement, written or oral, thus I figured I was okay with just the divorce agreement.

She says that that isn’t so and that she intends to force me to refile, etc. so, I guess the question is am I basically screwed? Or is it possible I’m in the right on this? Thanks."
374,374,"Cop took my plates, wont give them back. Bought new car, legally transfered my old plates to my new car. Got pulled over in MI, cop wont accept paper work from me or directly from DMV.

You send in the approved application/e-reciept with the title, both signed and dated. 

You keep a copy of everything as well. On the bottom of the e_reciept it stats 'operation of this vehicle is legal when you place the documents listed in the mail for delivery to:....'. 

I got pulled over in MI for an unrelated reason(not important but i can go into detail if you want) he couldnt find anything in their data base connecting my current car with the plate. Thats to be expected because of how soon it was. He also did not like the paper i have from the DMV with the above quote. He then had it impounded and removed the plates. That was last night.

I ask him exactly what he needs from the DMV to prove that the plates belong with my car. He says he needs some paperwork directly from them. I have the DMV fax and email him all paperwork involved they have, and he still wont accept it until its fixed in their system where he can electronicly check it. Which is different proof then what he asked for earlier. They even call him to explain that its legal for me to drive. Unfortunatly they cant put it in electonicly until at least monday when they get the stuff i mailed in. In the meantime my car is racking up impound fees and i have a court date for driving with improper plates. What do i do?"

After several months of back and forth with only small increases in the offer from Geico, I finally accepted their settlement, and promptly turned around and sued the other driver in Small Claims Court for the difference. Geico told the other driver that their duties of subrogation had been met and he was on his own for this, so he showed up with his own lawyer for the initial hearing. The day after the hearing, that lawyer then contacted Geico, seemingly disputed their stance on subrogation, and then Geico contacted me with a settlement offer of the amount for which I was suing.

So in the end, Geico paid me the total replacement value of the vehicle as I saw it."
376,376,Airport confiscated insulin,"My diabetic (t1) mother flew from Michigan to Florida today with a connecting flight in Philadelphia. She has been having a lupus flare up, so I arranged for a wheelchair for her weeks ago to take her to her gates/baggage claim. I also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. When she landed in Philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. When she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). She explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. They told her she could check it or she could stay in Philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. She surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. When she landed in Tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. He took her to baggage claim and I guess her medical bag was lost. She is now in Florida with no insulin, no medication. Her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over. 

I am beyond upset. I have called AA and they confirmed that insulin is allowed on board. What legal ramifications are there for this?

377,377,MN: Someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.,"This past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. They had been there for a bit when I let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously I wouldn't have done so). My dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). I coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

Last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. I can only imagine where he will be going with this.

I know I need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now I'm not even sure where to start. Am I liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? Since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

Edit: I should mention I Googled and the balloon bit that was ripped apparently costs tens of thousands. So that's why I'm concerned."
378,378,"I (27 M) have been raising my son (8) since he was born. His mother who left before he was even 1 is now threatening me with attorneys and court, should I be extremely worried?","This is a throwaway account and actually my first post on Reddit ever. 

So my story is a long and complicated one, but hey who's isn't. Here goes. 

I had my son at 19 years old and what a journey it has been. I have felt the highest joys and the deepest frustrations while growing side by side with my son. But I'd do it all again for him. 

His mother and I separated before he turned 1. She moved to NYC to ""find"" a better future for him. She said that the first few years of his life, ""don't really matter because he won't remember them."" And while that may be true in a way, she'll never remember his first steps, his first words, his first fears and how he conquered them, his first falls, his worries about the doctor's office and those ever painful shots, and all the small things in day to day life. 

My parents and extended family have helped me tremendously in so many ways. I have even tried my best to build and maintain a relationship with her side of the family while she threw them all to the wayside in her pursuit of her new life in the city. We have spent more holidays with them than she has. Her father has even multiple times told me he would be on our side if it ever came to a court.

 She has erased all traces of being a mom even on ALL social media platforms, so no one in her life in the city know that she is a mother.

During the first 4 years of his life she would only see him for the ""big"" dates (holidays/birthday). 
The longest stretch of time she has spent with him in his 8 years of life is 6 days. I take him to school, pay for school, take him to the doctors, feed him, and take care of his every need financially, physically, emotionally and everything in between. 

Fast forward to when he is around 5 and a half. I fall in love for the first time in my entire life. My girlfriend (24F) and I become everything parents should be for a child. We build a home together and the love between the 3 of us has literally brought us to tears. This of course infuriates her since day 1. 

(The mother of my child on the other hand went right into a relationship less than a month after us separating, and many more relationships after that.) 

She never sends him anything. No clothes, no care packages, no visits. She bought him a ""deluxe"" iPad and Louis Vuitton pants when he was like 3. That iPad has been their only form of communication because she refuses to talk to me. She calls him maybe twice a month tops. Sends him cat videos occasionally. Never answers when my son tries to call her. 

Today is my son's 8th birthday and my son, my girlfriend, my son's godfather and I, all had the most fantastic day at a water park and riding boardwalk rides and eating yummy snacks the whole day through. But of course all good things must come to an end. We come home to see that I have literally 30 missed calls from 1:15 pm -1:30 pm. (She hasn't called me since last October when she decided she was leaving the entire financial responsibility of my sons school tuition on me after agreeing, like we always had, that we would split it.) ((She said I'm the main caretaker and I should be responsible for that, and that she doesn't need to pay if she doesn't want to.)) When I got home and called her back is when the most recent argument broke out....

I have never slandered her name publicly or privately and have always tried to help encourage them to have a relationship. I used to even drive my son TO and FROM my home state to NYC so that they could see each other.  Every child should have a mother in his life I truly believe that... But just because you gave birth doesn't mean you're a mother. My mom and my girlfriend have both been shining lights in his life... He has everything he needs. I try to do the best I can every single day that I walk this Earth with him. 

I had to pick up a 2nd job to make ends meet regarding his school tuition and all the other costs of living. Obviously next year he's not going back to that school. But working more means seeing him less and it breaks my heart but i know we'll figure things out like we always have....

Now what I'm asking is should I be very worried if she keeps threatening me with attorneys and court? She has done it many times in the past and she knows that it hurts me. Losing my son would be earth shattering for me... What should I do? Should I be the one to take her to court first? She warns me that she is well connected with lawyers in NYC, does that change anything even though my son and I have been living in NJ our whole lives? I'm just feeling lousy and lost. 

I don't know how to end this, I don't know how to even write this. Please don't mind my grammar or how I structured this. And to the patient brave Souls who read this entire memoir, even if it's just 1 person, I appreciate you SO much and any insight you can share would mean the world to my little family. 

Thank you."
379,379,Cousins ex bf is suing me because I reacted violently to a horrible prank he pulled,"
I am from Oregon. One of my cousins (now ex) bf of a year, who is trying to become a famous YouTube prankster pulled a prank on me where he pretended to abuse my little cousin. 

When I came home I heard yelling and the sounds of hitting and crying coming from my cousins room. When I ran up the stairs her bf came out and I asked what the hell was going on. In his words, “that b*tch cheated on me, so she got what she deserved” as I could still hear crying from that room and he was blocking the door from letting me in. I immediately blacked out(my dad used to physically abuse my mom in front of me, he knows this) and punched and kicked and next thing I knew he was on the floor screaming it was just a prank. I went into the room and he had a recording of a girl screaming but no one there. My cousin wasn’t even in on the prank, she didn’t know it was happening. 

I checked if he was ok and his nose was bleeding, and his braces had cut really badly into his lips. I drove him to the ER because he was claiming he couldn’t breathe out of his nose. He ended up with a fractured nose, and got stitches in his lip. The ER bill came out to almost $2k and he’s telling me I need to pay it. I refused. 

My cousin has since broken up with him.

He’s now suing me for assaulting and for the hospital bill. 

I still have the phone he was using to record the video but no way to access it because neither I or my cousin knows the passcode. 

What can I do? Is there a way for the court to demand he unlock his phone? Is it just his word against mine? I have no other proof besides his channel where he’s pulled pranks but not to the extent of this."
380,380,Cell phone repair guy stole my nudes!,"   Just like the title said, dropped my phone off, an imessage was sent to an unfamiliar number while it was there - I could see it on iMessage through my Mac. It contained 5 of my more private photos. 

   Upon pickup the employees were dismissive saying no one would do such a thing, and they can’t touch texts because they’d be in “big trouble”. The offending employee was quick to blame it on a glitch that comes with the new update, an update I haven’t even applied. Not to mention the photos were stored in a separate app. 

  I called the number a while later to find that it belonged to the employee. He apologized and promised to delete the photos, but I am pretty upset that my privacy was violated. I called the store to complain but only the offending employee was there and wouldn’t let me speak to his boss. I’ve left a complaint email but is this grounds for legal action? I can’t help but think I may not be the only person he’s done this to."
381,381,[MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. I am 16 years old. I got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows I cheated. I didn't cheat. My math has always been good except last year when I was dealing with depression. She says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so I must have cheated.

I told her that I didn't cheat and I'm offended at the accusation. Two days ago I was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that I should confess to cheating and tell them how I did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. He more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

I told him that I'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that I didn't cheat but he said that I could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. I told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? He still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that I could get that score.

Yesterday I was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if I let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if I give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. I have no knowledge of what he is talking about and I declined access to my social media and email.

I'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. This to me sounds very unfair and I can't help but feel like I'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? Because this does not make any sense. They have no evidence that I cheated and refused my offer of retaking the exam and they insulted my intelligence."

This is in Chesapeake, Virginia.

It has been 3 days since I found the word ""pedo"" engraved onto the passenger side door of my vehicle. I have a couple of updates on the situation.

When I got home, I confronted my roommate, and he slipped up saying ""he didn't care"" when I told him that he got caught on my cars camera keying up my vehicle. I of course lied, but he didn't know that.

I dropped off my car at the collision center, and I heard back from them today on the total amount of damages estimated to have been done to my car. The amount is over $1300, and that includes the deductible. According to Virginia's vandalism statutes, that is now enough to be felony vandalism. I have updated the Chesapeake Police Department on the cost, and I am hoping that it gets assigned an investigator.

Tomorrow, I am heading down to Chesapeake General District Court in order to file a small claims suit against my roommate before he moves out in an attempted effort to recoup some of the money that I have lost so far. That includes damages, renting a vehicle, and court filing fees.

384,384,[UPDATE] Recently settled a custody dispute and finally have my first overnight. Ex and her husband insist on entering my residence and I insist that they not. What can I do?,"Link to Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa\_recently\_settled\_a\_custody\_dispute\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa_recently_settled_a_custody_dispute_and/)

This is a bit of a lengthy update; it's still very fresh in my mind so I will try to keep useless details to a minimum. TL;DR of the original post is, my ex wife has a documented history of misrepresenting facts and presenting false allegations with regard to my personal well-being and living conditions. After going through court we settled for basically everything that I wanted, and today was supposed to be the first custody exchange. The TL;DR for this update can be found down below.

I called my city's non-emergency line on Thursday to inquire about civil standbys. The operator gave me some great information, and I got really confident that all would go according to plan.

I also contacted a friend who my ex knows and has a neutral-positive rapport with, and he came by for moral support and to be a third-party witness to the whole ordeal. Side note, my God, I am so happy that I have this guy in my life because he was the absolute perfect person to have with me for the whole ordeal. If you're seeing this man -- thank you again.

This morning ahead of the exchange I called my city's non-emergency line back as instructed, and they dispatched officers to my residence. When they arrived, they informed me that because there is no order for supervised exchanges or a peace/protective order in place, they were not going to be able to provide service as requested. Big fucking bummer, but not the end of the world.

My buddy showed up, I brought him inside and showed him around the place (since my ex knows him I hoped he may be able to vouch for my living conditions), and we prepared for their arrival. They showed up a little bit later, I got my phone out, started a video, put my phone in my breast pocket, and we went outside on the sidewalk to attempt the exchange.

Essentially what happened is I reiterated my stance: They were not welcome inside, and I would be taking our child inside per the agreement that we both signed and that was signed by a judge. My ex and her husband immediately began raising their voices (with my child being held by his mother outside in sub-freezing temperatures) and insisting that they needed to get our child inside because it was so cold out, and they would be coming with him. As I stood firm and calmly/repeatedly reminded them that I had no obligation to let them inside and that it would not be happening, they began making threats to call CPS because I was ""leaving our child out in the cold""; that they ""smelled drugs,"" and then my ex accused me of looking hungover (which is ridiculous considering everyone is well aware that I've been sober for over 2 years).

Anyway, you get the gist -- it didn't go well. It was also a very public dispute, and because of the continuously raised voices on the part of my ex and her husband, someone in the neighborhood called the cops. Before they arrived, my ex and her husband threatened to call them as well, which I encouraged, and as soon as they went back to their car to do so, the police that someone else had called showed up.

Essentially the officers informed both of us that they could not force the child to enter my residence without his mom, but that I was fully within my right to deny her entry and that if she chose to leave with our child, she would be in violation of the court order (which I had printed and brought with me), and they would be writing that into their incident report. They encouraged her to call her lawyer which I believe she attempted but was unsuccessful in doing. She came back claiming that her lawyer stated that, ""If the minor child doesn't wish to enter the residence without her, then she would not be found in contempt of the order."" Literally everybody present knew that that was false and told her that, but she refused to believe it. She then made threats to get $30,000 -- no, *$100,000* \-- from her father to take me back to court.

The officers repeatedly informed my ex that she had two options: Drop the kid off, or violate the order. They encouraged her to pick. I asked if she would feel more comfortable if an officer entered my residence to attest to my living conditions, she thought about it for a minute, but did not budge. Her way or the highway.

By this time it had been over an hour of argument, we hadn't gotten anywhere, the police had another more urgent call, and their involvement was proving futile. My ex agreed to go back to her vehicle and ""attempt to encourage our child to go inside"" (I firmly believed the opposite was going on). After 20 minutes she informed me that he did not want to go inside unless she could join him. I asked if I could speak to him directly, which she allowed, and I very calmly let him know how sorry I was that this was happening this way, that I know we had both been very excited for this day for a long time, and that I hoped we would still be able to have our fun day together. I asked if he also hoped we could still have a fun day together, and he said yes. So I asked him if he felt comfortable coming inside, and he said yes, at which point both his mother and step-father turned around and said, ""But you're not comfortable unless mommy comes with you, right?"" He hesitated, they both shook their heads to coach him, and he shook his head. They took that as proof that my ex was not in contempt and that we would ""have to reschedule,"" and then drove off.

Police returned as this was happening and asked if I  would like to leave a domestic victim statement, which I did. They gave me my copy, handed me a card with info necessary to retrieve the police report, gave me a little bit of a pep talk, and went on their way.

I'm devastated -- absolutely heartbroken. I've been looking forward to this day for years; it finally came, and my ex just couldn't face the music and live a life where she doesn't have complete control over mine.

I know that I handled this the right way and that I now have a slam dunk case for contempt. I hate that this has to be so difficult. To anyone going through anything similar, you're not alone -- this sucks, but we got this. Keep fighting for them kids, y'all.

\----------

**TL;DR:** In the end, police involvement did not stop my ex or her husband from insisting that they had every right to enter my residence. In the process, they convinced themselves that the order ""was an agreement between us, not something ordered by a judge,"" even with police telling them directly that if they left, my ex would in fact be in violation of the order, and that it would be documented in an official police report. I still don't get an overnight with my kid, but I have a slam dunk contempt case and my kid knows I'm not the crazy one."
385,385,"[TX] My brother had a heart attack at work, colleagues wasted 8 minutes before calling 911 because of a policy that employees can't call 911.","Basically the title. My brother was at work, he collapsed suddenly. His colleagues saw him. First they tried to awake him but he was unresponsive. Someone wanted to call 911 but there's a policy at their workplace that employees must ask a supervisor before they call emergency services. They can be disciplined for not doing so. It took several minutes to get ahold of a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived, he was not sure what to do and wasted more time calling his own superior to be sure he had the right to call an ambulance, and making sure it was a ""real"" emergency (he's not trained in first aid at all, none of them are, so idk what he was hoping to achieve). A call to 911 was finally placed more than 8 minutes after my brother collapsed. There's video of his his colleagues running in circles and using their phones to try find their supervisor. my brother is unconscious in the ICU, he will very likely have brain damage. At the hospital we were told that the 8 minute delay was critical and almost certainly impacted his outcome. Response times are for emergency services are usually very good in our the area, they would have come much sooner had anyone just called. 

&#x200B;

So I'm here to ask if it's legal to have a policy that your employees can't call 911 immediately when they witness an emergency. Is it something his employer can be held liable for? It's nothing short of criminal imo, I'm livid."
386,386,[California] I cancelled tattoo appointment because the tattoo artist was high AF.

When I made the appointment everything seemed fine and professional, and I made a safety deposit of 500$ which is not at all unusual.

When I turned up to the appointment a month later, I noticed the artist was super stoned (red eyes, reeking of weed, slurred speech...) to the point that I didn't feel comfortable getting tattooed by him. I requested a new appointment with another artist. The lady at the reception didn't understand my problem, became insulting and refused to offer me either my safety deposit back or a new appointment. Finally she called somebody else (higher up the chain apparently) on the phone who confirmed they would transfer the deposit back to my account. Stupidly I assumed the problem was resolved and left.

Not only didn't they not transfer it back, they proceeded to make an angry post on their facebook page about how 'some people' just cancel appointments without notice and then have the 'audacity' to demand their money back. For a few minutes the post included a link to my name until they presumably deleted it. 

So here I am with 500$ less and no tattoo, was I legally 'in the right' to refuse being tattooed by someone under the influence - like, would this count as a legit reason? I was honestly worried it would turn out shit. What do I do next?"
387,387,"UPDATE! Three years ago, my ex forged medical records to lie about vaccinating our daughter and landed her in the hospital.","Hello again everyone out there, [three years ago I made a post about how my ex lied about vaccinating our daughter](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Soon after [I gave an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aw6gch/my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and disappeared over the horizon. I had completely forgotten about making that post as the last few years dealing with a global pandemic and an immunocompromised daughter have aged me 3 decades. But, I saw a post recently talking about my own posts and it came back like a ton of bricks. After wrestling to get back into this account, here I am. I hope you all are still interested in an update.

Well, to give the short answer first, I have full custody of my daughter, and my ex is barred from having any contact with her.

The long answer, my court battle between my ex and me was a grueling process, one of the worst periods of my life. It took over 5 months from the time I got emergency custody to get full custody of my daughter. In retrospect, those 5 months were not as long as they felt, but they felt like the longest months of my life at that point. My ex's harassment at that time got worse, even coming to my house and attempting to force herself in to take our daughter. She was arrested for this and charged with attempted forced entry. Before she could bail herself out, the DA decided to throw the book at her for forging medical documents. She ended up spending a month in jail for this, which unfortunately got our custody case contuned. The upside of this was I was given a protective order for me and my daughter out of this, one that bit her in the ass when we finally got in front of a judge,

I was given full custody of my daughter. My ex and her lawyer pissed off the judge by trying to claim that I had planned this all from the start. Forcing her into a corner to vaccinate our daughter so I could use her response to initiate the custody battle. Her actions, her upcoming hearing for committing felony forgery and forced entry, along with the protective order convinced the judge that my ex was more than a danger to our daughter. She lost all custodial rights, and as of now is not legally allowed to contact her in any form. My protective order was extended by two years as well, but I didn't need it as it was only a few months later she went to prison.

My ex pleaded out, they dropped the forced entry charge and she only got 2 years in prison for the forgery but was still hit with the felony. She was released early due to covid though. Since then, luckily, I have had no contact with my ex outside of getting the child support I am owed. I am not really inclined to keep tabs on her personal life, but I know that she went off the conspiracy deep end. She is now a full Qanon supporter, and dating someone who was involved in the January 6th insurrection. Other than that, she has disappeared from my daughter's life entirely.

As for me and my daughter? The past few years have been a living nightmare. We moved to a new state and I had to put her into fully online schooling. But, our lives are great. And, amazingly, my daughter was able to get the covid vaccine only a month ago and is cleared to go to physical school once the summer ends.

This saga of my life has taught me so many things. I am grateful every day to have my daughter with me, safe and in a place where she can slowly grow and get healthier. It's kinda touching that so many people are interested after all this time in a normal guy like me and my daughter. I genuinely hope this is the last update I have to make. Thank you for your interest, and see you all over the next horizon."
388,388,"[NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago. My supplier is blaming UPS, UPS is blaming me and refusing to do anything. What can i do?","I run a hobby shop in New York state. I have a supplier who i have worked with for years, who typically sends me my product via UPS. 

UPS has been massively delayed due to COVID, i went from getting orders multiple times a week to basically almost nothing for the last 8 weeks. I had nearly a 100 packages sitting in UPS distribution center, some of them have been forever stuck in the state of ""Out for Delivery"" for weeks now, to things basically entering the black hole of the local distribution center weeks ago with no updates. 

This hurt my business pretty bad (which was already suffering due to COVID) as a lot of this stuff was items people had ether pre-paid or waiting for me to get my hands on. 

On June 26th when i was more or less in bed, i suddenly got a slew of delivery notifications from UPS around 10 pm. Since i live a good 45 minutes away from my store, i freaked out and by the time i managed to get there. The stuff delivered had been taken, i checked the CCTV for my store entrance and probably 10 minutes after UPS dumped the packages some people came by and picked up all the items and took off. 

I made a police report and passed it along to UPS as they had completely screwed up. On Friday i got an update and UPS had closed all my claims stating that it was signed for. The signature was basically the word COVID. Which from my understanding is UPS not requiring signatures due to COVID. 

The following blame is going around in a circle:

* My supplier is blaming UPS and how it isn't their fault, and tells me they fulfilled their obligation and i need to contact UPS. 
* My supplier doesn't have anymore of some of the products, so i can't actually fulfill many peoples orders now.  
* UPS is putting the blame on me stating that it was signed for and is refusing to discuss it more.

Am i able to do anything?"

We talked to the teacher and principal. They have been less than helpful to say the least.

There has been some back and forth via emails and visiting the school and the principal has been mostly hands off and the teacher has retaliated against our daughter.

I don't think the the specifics are super important but in the end we asked ""perhaps seating be rearranged"". The teacher decided to announce to the class that our daughter was ""afraid"" of the boy and moved her to a desk next to her desk. Like, literally next to hers, facing the rest of the class. My daughter is mortified and has said she will never tell us about anything ever again. My daughter is ""safe"" but at what cost?

391,391,[UPDATE] I live in California and have been paying my rent on time and just got a notice to vacate premises within 3 days,"[Original Thread Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pa7hh3/i_live_in_california_and_have_been_paying_my_rent/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Quick recap: My previous landlord was foreclosed on 5 months in to our lease. New landlord who purchased the property we are renting issued us a notice to vacate within 3 days.

Contacted the new landlord telling them I know my rights as a tenant and would like to stay the remainder of the lease or would be up to negotiating a cash for keys option (at the advice of some of the users on here 😁). Was immediately told that wouldn't be possible because our lease was ""fraudulent"" and we had to leave asap or they would contact the police.

At the advice of multiple people on this sub, I contacted my university (which I attend) who got me in contact with multiple resources. Ended up applying for my city's EPP (eviction protection program) who assigned an attorney that specializes in Tenancy law to me free of charge. 

My awesome attorney managed to resolve the entire matter within a week! Basically told me the new landlords had NO CASE and were more than likely trying to bully me out of my lease. She gathered all of the legal paperwork regarding the ownership of the property and who signed my lease and spoke with the new landlords attorney who basically agreed 100% (bet the new landlords are pissed 😂). 

Ended up getting the new landlords to sign paperwork that same day saying they'd honor our lease. Although, I'm not feeling too comfortable after this entire shit show, so I'll be considering a cash for keys option to find a new place to live (don't want to stay in a potentially hostile tenancy environment).

Basically, my attorney is a badass and I'll be getting her and her team a gift of gratitude! 😁 Try to show your attorney's some love!"

393,393,Doctor called my mother with test results after I explicitly told them I am no longer associated with her number.,"This takes place in Pennsylvania.

I went to the doctor for a suspected blood clot. I arrived at the family doctor, they had some of my contact information wrong. So we rehashed addresses and phone numbers. When we got to phone numbers, the woman working the desk read mine aloud. I said, ""yep, that's mine."" She proceeds to say, ""and -insert my mom's #-?""

I *explicitly* state that I am no longer associated with that phone number. I ask the receptionist to remove it. She nods. Cool, we are out of the woods.

I get sent for imaging at a specialized facility. Get my ultrasound, no blood clot. Cool, we are out of the woods. 

I get stuck in traffic for about an hour and a half driving home. I got several phone calls I couldn't pick up because I refuse to use my phone while driving. I get home, see a missed call from my family doctor and call them back. ""Hey, it's a negative for a blood clot."" I already knew that but thank you, have a good day. 

I get inside and I was tagged in a Facebook post by my mother. I see she has also taken to messaging me on facebook. ""Hey, the doctor's office said your mailbox was full~ you are negative for DVT 😊""

They notified my mother after I explicitly told them that her number was not to be a part of my contact information.

What are my options here? This is not the first time something like this has happened. I had a doctor at the same facility go into the waiting room and relay everything I begged her to keep secret to my mother, in ear shot of literally every unoccupied person in the facility at that point in time about 6 years ago when I was 16.

There has to be some kind of recourse for this. This is terrible practice."
394,394,A lady at my gym suffered a seizure in the woman's locker room - she's now threatening to sue. I am 16 years old.,"(Pennsylvania) Hi there,

I am a 16 year old Junior in high school and work part-time at a gym.  I generally open the gym on weekends at 7 AM, and am alone in the building until our housekeeping staff come in at 8:00.
It starts out slow as members come in, and usually picks up around 9 when our Sales staff and General Manager come in.  The gym is a two story facility.

Earlier this morning around 8ish, I was approached by another member who stated there was a woman in the locker room (downstairs) who was laying on a bench shaking and presumably having a seizure.  So I RUN downstairs to the locker room, and sure enough, there is a woman shaking uncontrollably, but breathing.  I had my cell phone with me and immediately called 911.  I stayed on the phone with the dispatcher while waiting for the EMTs and Paramedics who arrived about five minutes later.

The dispatcher stated I should absolutely NOT try to perform CPR/First Aid (I am licensed) or move her, only to hold on to her make sure she did not fall off the bench.  The EMT's manage to revive? (I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term here) her and she gets wheeled out of the gym and to the hospital. I'd say we were in the locker room for about 20 minutes trying to convince her to go -- she was VERY stubborn.  There was a personal trainer who was there to help me with whom I am EXTREMELY grateful for.  I filled out an Incident report and filed it with our GM when he came in.

We have had concerns with this member before, as she has health issues.  The thing is, I have absolutely no idea how long she was suffering from a seizure for.  It looked as if she was in the midst of changing in to gym gear when it happened.  She checked in shortly after 7:15 AM.

I just received a text message from my GM and she is now threatening to sue us for her seizure.  Can she come after me personally??  As I said, I have no idea how long she was in that state for and I am terrified!  Thank you in advance for your answers!"
395,395,Allergic child in son’s class (NJ),"My son is in full-day kindergarten, and the kids eat lunch and snack in their classroom (not the cafeteria), because there is a child with severe allergies to multiple foods. I first of all want to say that I am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. I can’t imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. At the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so I can’t pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- Parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- Parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. The teacher suggested (but it’s not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/


Again, I am happy to comply as best I can, but I am curious at what point accommodations go from reasonable to unreasonable. 



Edit: Just to clarify, because a lot of people have questions:

- Kids wash their hands at the classroom sink as soon as they get to school, and before and after lunch. 

- Kids *are* allowed to bring packaged food that contains allergens (other then peanuts), just no liquid milk, yogurt or hard boiled eggs, and no snacks that leave a heavy powder residue like Doritos. Kids can get food “delivered” from the cafeteria, as long as it’s not the above mentioned food. 

- there are only two classes per grade, so switching classes is not a sustainable option. 


My kid is doing okay for now, thanks to his love of pita and hummus, which comes in a prepackaged snack cup. However if next week he decides he doesn’t like hummus, or if he is being too messy with the hummus (the kid with allergies is allergic to sesame, which is in hummus apparently) we’ll be in a jam- no pun intended, I think actual jam is okay."
396,396,[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.

I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.

The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.

How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago. For my share I have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too. Should I find my own lawyer and if I need one what kind do I need? I have an accountant I've used for years but this doesn't seem like an accounts problem but a law one."

This is probably not the most interesting update you'll come across, but I know this forum likes updates so I may as well. 

Long story short, I was contacted by the husband of the woman whose dog caused my crash. He wanted to keep this out of court for reasons related to issues that his wife was going through. It's not my place to elaborate on it but it's something that I understand very well due to a member of my family dealing with something similar. Anyway, he offered to cover my medical expenses/pay for a new bike, I agreed to go this route, and to say that he's been fair with me wouldn't do justice to the situation.

My arm is still a little uncooperative at times, but the doctors I've seen are actually thrilled with how fast/thoroughly I've healed. I'm also still dating the cute good samaritan, which has been an interesting experience since we started seeing each other shortly before COVID took over the world (I'm actually a few towns over from the initial ""containment zone"" in the NYC suburbs) but it's going well and we have an interesting ""how we met"" story to tell haha. 

So yeah, all things this has had a happy, nondramatic ending. Thanks again to everyone who offered advice in my original post."

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

Thank you all for the wonderful advice, especially the fact that i am allowed to elect someone by proxy to do a unit inspection. I am never going to rent out my room again because this has been a massive battle.

My friend to rent the room for a single night because my land lord never responded about doing a walkthrough in time, and i was nervous. Turns out someone not Jane, but someone who identified himself as Janes coworker who works for Company X, met my friend in the parking lot. He gave him the keys. I don't know who this person is but i am not comfortable with some random person having my apartment keys.

My friend ironically was rejected by the concierge service, who asked him what room he was going to. (I forgot to tell my property manager about this). My friend got a full refund from AirBnB and him and his girlfriend were put up in a nice hotel a few blocks away by AirBnB for the night.

My property manager did respond and was kind enough to do a video walkthrough with me on speaker phone, and honestly my apartment is not in great shape at all. Apparently it stinks of cigarettes and weed, and there was a beer can being used as an ash tray, which is not allowed since our apartment building is ""Smoke Free"". I have stains/burns on my couch which looks like from cigarettes.

AirBNB has not done anything, and her listing is still up (i can't find any other listings of hers).

Jane however has been constantly sending me angry emails, about how i am impacting her financial situation, to how it is making her look bad as an AirBNB host. I told her bluntly the things that i saw from the walkthrough and how it stinks of smoke and we are a smoke free building. She claims she never signed any sort of agreement about condo rules, and i sent her a picture of the agreement she signed, including the condo rules page.

I offered to let her out of the lease, and not pay any more rent money for the remainder of the time on the lease. Skipping Novemeber/December. If she left, and had the apartment cleaned. She on the other hand demanded $5,000 for her to vacate from the apartment early. When i refused she told me ""I will do everything within my power to make ur life a living hell for fucking with me"".

My lawyer has made the complaint with the LTB, and he thinks it will most likely be resolved by the end of December. This has taught me a hard lesson, and i will never rent my apartment again.

Anyways thanks for the advice."

So it has been a while since my previous update, and I wish I could tell you all that it's because we were involved in a super exciting court battle (""No, YOU'RE out of order!"") but the truth is much more annoying and banal, as life tends to be. 

As we left it in the last post a couple months ago, our lawyer called the law firm who submitted the action against our property and said ""You have no grounds for this, take it off."" The paralegal he spoke to said the lawyer handling the case was out that day but would contact our lawyer soon.

They did not. For WEEKS. Despite everyone bugging them, they were very disinterested in resolving the issue. Color me shocked.

In the meantime, we're getting junk mail from law firms and mortgage management companies at least every 2-3 days, saying they can help us with this issue we don't have. The notices start to be addressed to us personally instead of the this other random guy who said he owned our house. This displeases us. I start keeping a little pile of these letters next to the stairs with copies of our mortgage payments notices from the bank, just in case.

This goes on for a while, long enough for my initial (!!!!!!!) anxiety to fade into more of an ""Eh."" situation. Until yesterday. 

Our lawyer finally got a response to his email from July, where he outlines everything and attached a preponderance of evidence showing we continue to own our house, and their response is, and I quote : ""We will remove the action."" Period. No Good Afternoon, no Sincerely. We will remove the action. A shart of an email after weeks of worry.

So with a whimper, we got what we wanted. Obviously we will continue to monitor everything until they actually do what they said they will, but it is a load off my mind. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you, but it seems in the legal world, exciting = bad.

Thank you all for your concern, your advice, and your upvotes. I hope that if any of you face a similar situation, that reading this can help you figure out how to resolve it.

403,403,My daughter (8F) came home from school yesterday with individually bagged anti depressants her mother sent her with that I was entirely unaware of. What are my options?,"My ex and I have maintained a, often at times,  highly contentious co-parenting relationship. We've been separated for over 7 years and I strongly disagree with many of her parenting methods. We have joint legal custody of our daughter and she has primary physical custody as my overnights equate to 30% of all overnights annually. On to last night...

As I'm finishing up dinner preparations, my daughter comes downstairs with three individual baggies and informs me she needs to take her medicine before dinner. After asking what medicine it is, she informs me it is to help with her stress. I immediately take the bags and tell her she will not be taking anything that I do not know about. I step outside to call her mother as I am fuming at this point because this is far from the first time I have been uninformed (whether it be school absences, doctor visits, etc.). Her mother proceeds to tell me she has started her on sertraline hydrochloride as a result of her stress levels and panic attacks of late. She says my daughter's therapist and primary physician decided this course of action based on her mother telling them of these alleged occurrences. 

Now her mother is truly someone I believe to exhibit the characteristics of munchausen syndrome by proxy. She has three other children (5, 3, and newborn) with each of them regularly diagnosed with new issues (yes, even the newborn). For some reason I have not witnessed a single occurrence of a panic attack in my daughter and her stress levels, although elevated at times (I mean, whose aren't?) are far from abnormal. 

I am at a complete and utter loss at the moment. For one, why would the first solution to be to put her on anti anxiety/depressant medication? For example, I know her bed times are consistently late (often approaching 11 pm), maybe her ""panic attacks"" are crankiness as a result of often being tired. Two, who in the world thinks it appropriate to send an eight year old child to school with unmarked bags with pills and rely on her to take proper doses at proper times, all without informing the other parent. Three, there is a newborn baby in their household and I can't help but feel her mother is overwhelmed and using this medication as a form of parenting.

Please help! Any and all information is appreciated from the bottom of my heart."

He's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. In December he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. I thought we were going to crash. He pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. When we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. He'd never done that before. The next day I faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. I told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. CPS was called and investigated about two weeks right around Christmas. They closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than I leave him again. (We were separated for Sox months over a year ago.) They said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. Since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. I caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. He grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his DS and left bruises. He has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

We just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. I feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

The only family I have is in Hawaii. We are in California. He has told me he will say I'm kidnapping of I try to go back with the kids.

I have no other family or friends

I have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

When we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and I had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park Inside our military housing. I don't know who took the pictures but I sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. Instead they told him I was causing his career trouble. They didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately I came back last March because we were about to be homeless. I then got pregnant.

Anyway, I want to save my kids. Please tell me how."

If it will be a longer time, then we would like her to be sent to live with my parents or my wife's parents in Mexico.  Is it safe to discuss this with her school, or can that get us into trouble?

406,406,Someone stole my CEO's identity and asked me to buy gift cards for the office. I fell for a scam hard how do I fix this?,"Hello,

Essentially someone stole my current company CEO's identity and emailed me to ask to do a favor from him. We are a small office so this did not seem out of the ordinary. They asked me to buy google play gift cards for a bonus and send them the details. I was out sick and my CEO's off sight a lot so I had no way of knowing it was not him. He also said he was in a conference call and could not call at the moment. So I purchased the cards and sent the scammer the details of the cards.  It was not until the scammer asked for a second batch that I realized that it might not be him. I called the office verified that it was not him. I immediately went to the police and filed a report.  Following this I contacted google and they canceled all nonactivated cards. They said they could do nothing about the activated cards. My company also called the credit card company and marked the purchases as fraudulent as they were made on the company card that they issued to me.  In total, I am potentially out 4700$ dollars.

The worst thing is that I was sick with a fever and had been dealing with family issues so I was preoccupied and why it did not stand out more as a fraud. Anyway, what is the best way to go about recovering the money? Also, am I in danger of any legal jeopardy?

Thanks

Edit: Thanks for the advice it was incredibly helpful. I found a way to resolve the situation. "
407,407,"[UPDATE] My neighbor has basically booby trapped his front yard, what can I legally do about it?","[Update to this post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8qspex/fl_my_neighbor_has_basically_booby_trapped_his/)

I got home late last night and the posts were still there so after walking my dog I called the police non-emergency line again and they said they'd send a car out early in the morning. 

I'm working from home today and sure enough around 8am a cop car pulled up to my neighbors house.  Two officers stepped out and kicked around his front yard where the posts were before going up to knock on his door.  There was about a 5 minute discussion where my neighbor looked quite agitated (couldn't hear what was said) but he came out with some gloves on and pulled all the posts out while the cops watched and he seemed to be shouting at them.  The officers took the posts then one handed him something (not sure if a citation, pamphlet, or something else) and drove away.  Neighbor left for work in a huff about 30 mins later.

Not sure if it's the last thing the neighbor will try but at least that hazard is gone.  Thanks to everyone for the advice.    "
408,408,I was pulled over for speeding and the officer borrowed my pen and made me give it back to him claiming it was his.,"Hi all, I’m in Florida and was pulled over for going 30 over the speed limit. I was perfectly nice to the officer, and apologized for my speed. He asked for my license and asked if the address on it was current, I told him no, that I had recently moved. He then asked me to write down my current address. I happened to have post it notes and pens in my middle compartment. I wrote down my address, gave him the post-it note and he then asked for my pen.(I don’t know at this point if he knew he was borrowing mine, or if he thought it was his). I complied and gave him my pen. He came back after giving me a ticket and had me sign it (giving me back my pen). I signed and put the pen away in its usual compartment, handing him back the signed ticket. He said “my pen?” And I said “oh I’m sorry that was my pen” he then said “give me back my pen” and I told him “sir, you had borrowed my pen. My father gave me this pen”. He insisted it was his, so I complied and gave it to him. Anyways, he left with my pen. Unfortunately, the pen was a silver pen (probably cost like 100 dollars, it was a nice pen) but it didn’t have anything specific for me to point out it was mine. All in all, I’m just annoyed he was able to walk away with my pen due to his shitty memory and lack of listening to me. What if that had been a 300 dollar pen? Is there anything I can do, like filing a complaint against him?"
409,409,"UPS driver stole my PS5 right in front of me, and I am mad. No one is willing to help.","This is in Texas.

I was lucky enough to find a PS5 console for sale on eBay in December.  I wanted it before Christmas to give as a gift, but since the expected delivery date was later than that,  I asked the seller if I could get it sooner.  The seller said I would have to pay $40 extra for UPS express delivery, which I did.

The UPS driver showed up at my house and explained that due to COVID they were not allowing customers to sign for packages, so she would need my full name to enter.  She put the package down on the ground and asked me for my name.  My name is complicated and unusual (I am from India) so I had to spell it out twice before she got it right.  During this process she made small talk and said ""you seem excited about this package"".  I said yes it's a gift for my nephew.  She asked what is it and I said it's the new console for the PS.  She said ""what a lucky kid"".  

After writing my name, she picked up the package off the ground, turned around, and started walking back to the van.  I thought she made a mistake so I yelled ""excuse me"" at her a couple of times, but she was obviously ignoring me. She just drove away and I was left standing there.  

I first contacted eBay.  They said that since the tracking shows it was delivered, they can't do anything.  Which is fair, it's not their fault.  I then contacted UPS and they said it was probably a mistake and the package should be delivered to me the next day.  Which it wasn't.  After a week I called again and they said that since it was marked delivered and the GPS of the delivery location is at my house, they consider it done and I can't fill out a claim.  I then contacted the police and they took a report but I didn't hear back, so after a few days I asked them and they said they can't follow up but they will inform me if the item is found.  Which I'm pretty sure it won't be.  

So now I'm at a loss of what to do.  The employee just blatantly took the package and walked away, and no one seems to be able to do anything.  eBay, UPS and the police are all saying it's the other's responsibility.  Unfortunately, I paid with eBay credit so I can't even do a dispute with Visa. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do now?"

415,415,"My Father died 4 months ago, my sister hid it from my brother and I, and we just found 2 days ago. She had him cremated w/o our knowledge and tried to cash in life insurance.. What are our options?","[PA] I get a call 2 days ago telling me that my Father has died back in March. I had no idea he was dead. I track down my sisters number (we havent talked in 3 years) and confront her about it. She said she felt no reason to tell me, my brother, or my Aunt (Dad's sister). No one in my family knew except her. The only reason we found out is because she texted my aunt asking for my deceased Grandmoms social security # so she could cash in his life insurance policy.

She also had him cremated without anyones knowledge, and is now trying to claim we owe her $4,000 for cremation costs. Its to my knowledge that Pennsylvania requires all living children decide on a burial action together?

I also called the life insurance company, as he had no will, and they told me no action could be taken without a death certificate (that she already has, but since none of us had knowledge about the death, we don't have)

It seems to me like she is trying to hide the death in order to collect all life insurance as her own.

What are my brother & I's options?

Thanks a bunch  


\*edit\* I have since called the funeral home, and the Funeral Home Director called me back from his personal cellphone and we talked for about an hour. It turns out he did this all as a favor to my sister because she was friends with his wife. He stated numerous times ""I'm gonna be honest, you could have my ass over this"", then tried to act all buddy buddy with me. My sister could of easily contacted me as my number has been the same for 10 years, and she has seen my mother numerous times in person since my Father died. The funeral home director could of contacted my Aunt, or just googled my fathers name and since I'm named after him I would of popped up.

*edit 2*

Hey guys: So My dad did not have a will, and the listed beneficiary to the life insurance was my grandmom (who is also dead). So my sister was trying to get my grandmoms social sec # and  death certificate in order to take over the life insurance policy.

Also I cant understand why my father was cremated, as he has had a funeral plot already bought and paid for next to his parents that we just had to pay to uncover and put him in. 

My brother and I are also a bit pissed that he was cremated without our knowledge or say so. Do we have any sort of wrongful cremation rights? 

There is also the issue of my sister claiming we owe her $4,000 for the cremation expenses as neither of us approved of it, never heard of cremations costing that much, and the funeral home still has his ashes."
416,416,UPDATE: A club posted pictures of me online and I want them gone,"The original post didn't get any attention, but updates on this sub are like crack to me, so I'm posting it if anyone is interested.

TL;DR on the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dvyzxu/a_club_posted_pictures_of_me_online_and_i_want/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share):
I went to a club with friends, I didn't know ahead of time they had a photographer. Some pictures of me were posted of me on their website and Facebook. I asked them to take the photos down, they refused because they were ""great promo pictures.""


Sooo despite some of you guys commenting or PM'ing me things like slut shaming and wanting to see the pictures, I actually received the correct advice!

Facebook was very helpful with getting the photos taken down there. I reached out to their support and reported the photos and they were taken down within a week.

Someone pointed out [this statute](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleI/Chapter214/Section3a)

>Section 3A. Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used within the commonwealth for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without his written consent may bring a civil action in the superior court against the person so using his name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof; and may recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use. If the defendant shall have knowingly used such person's name, portrait or picture in such manner as is prohibited or unlawful, the court, in its discretion, may award the plaintiff treble the amount of the damages sustained by him.

That pointed me in the right direction of getting a cease and desist letters written. I have a friend who called in a favor with an IP lawyer who handled my case for very cheap. She was also pretty angry about it too when I told her about it, so I guess that was also motivation to help out a broke college kid. 


It took two cease and desist letters, but the pictures were finally taken down within two months. I have a sinking suspicion it cost me a job offer in the meantime, but I'm not sure enough to actually do anything about it even if I could.


Anyway, thanks guys!

417,417,[UPDATE] My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I’ve been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. NYC.,"First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. I did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

When I posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that I put together without putting in much thought because well I just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and I pretty much panicked.  

For some context, I’ve been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. I’m very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. So while I was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that I stole $3700, I’m wanted for arrest and there’s a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. This is how I was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

So from all the advice that I was given.. I decided to check on this RO and couldn’t find it at all in the system. Turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things I was hearing was true. 

So I got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. My things were everywhere. So I called the police. I let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

My room was indeed broken into and trashed. Many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. I was devastated. I filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

During all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. Turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? Unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. The police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. I was advised that this was a matter of civil (I think) court and I would have to settle this there. They also advised me that I could stay here BUT they believe that it wasn’t in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. So they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else I had left and I am now still staying with my friend. 

As for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything’s that happened. We’re mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

I don’t really have a place to call home now and I pretty much have to start over since I was only able to grab clothes. Even if I did end up grabbing all my things, I wouldn’t have anywhere to put it. In hindsight, I feel foolish for being tricked. I guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least I know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and I find comfort in that. Again, thank you."
418,418,police officials are forcing me to cremate my daughter,"my (45f) daughter (21f) passed away about a week ago, i have no motivation to do anything. i’ve been talking to many police officials and doctors. i won’t say how she died, but she went on a vacation trip and didn’t come back. her friends called me and she passed away soon after. 

police officers are urging me to cremate her body. i want to bury her, but they keep saying that it’s not worth it and that they won’t allow me to bury her because her body “belongs” to that country. they said the only way i can take her with me is if she’s in ashes. i’m heartbroken, she vacationed in mexico. i’ve tried looking this up, but i don’t find anything credible. can they legally make me cremate her?

edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to reply and anyone who sent their condolences. my husband and i never thought about contacting the embassy. we’re relieved knowing that we do have options. my daughter was a US citizen and she was healthy prior to all this. there’s no reason why she can’t be transported in my opinion."
419,419,[OH] Sister stole ~$4500 necklace and pawned it for $50,"First, I'm writing this for my friend since she doesn't have an account.

Her sister stole a ~$4500 necklace (that was given to her by her deceased uncle) from her dads house and sold it to a pawn shop for $50.  We don't know exactly when (her sister claims it was months ago), but my friend got [this](https://imgur.com/a/BfmkWyJ) in the mail.  There was a receipt included and the pawn shop should have her ID on record.  Also, her mom and her sister have basically admitted to all of this in text messages and claim they're going to get the necklace back ""eventually""

So, obviously she wants to go get the necklace back herself (since it's unlikely that her mom is going to do it) and file a police report.  How exactly should we go about this?  My plan is to go to the pawn shop, see what info they can give us, then go file the police report, then go BACK to the pawn shop and ask how we can get the necklace back.  We would prefer to not have to pay for the necklace, so could we pay for it and then have her mom pay us back?  Also, what is likely to happen to her sister?

This is honestly a really upsetting time for her and her family, and the top priority is getting the necklace back and I personally would like her sister to face consequences for her actions since this isn't the first time (and probably won't be the last time) she's stolen from family.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: well I went to work and missed all the action before the post got locked so a few things:
1) thank you all for the advice
2) I got downvoted a lot for saying we were waiting until Monday, and even got a few messages telling me we obviously didn’t care that much - we physically *can’t* go until then, we both have jobs and other life circumstances (and honestly, that’s really personal and I don’t think I need to explain why). I understand it’s not ideal but hey, that’s life. Please stop yelling at me about it. 
3) the notice was on a postcard - no mail was opened

UPDATE 8PM EST: necklace has been returned, along with the receipt saying her sister sold it then took it back. Still going to the police on Monday. Thanks for the help again!"

LL won't let me out of the lease, police say it is a civil issue.","I am renting a room in Toronto for university, the apartment is shared between 3 of us, i have a lease for my room and nothing else. I moved into this place in January, and up until May it was just me and the other roommate. In April LL told us a couple (not 1 person) would be moving into the empty room. I was fine with it because i didn't care that much.

When they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. We immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. Landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

Those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the LTB. But it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. On top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

The family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. Last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. He came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

Last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and then trying forcibly force my friend out of the apartment before i called the police. The police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment. I broke down when explaining the whole situation to the police officer, and while he empathized with me he told me it was a domestic issue.

I am sick of this, i want out now. My roommate's lease is up at the end of August but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. I don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

How can i break my lease? What are the penalties for breaking my lease? I offered my landlord 2 months of rent (all i can afford) and he didn't take it."
422,422,Update to neighbour purposely trying to catch covid 19. Ontario,"So I hadn't heard anything from the neighbour until this morning when her husband stuck something in my mailbox so I talked to him through the window. 

He told me that he was contacted about her behavior while he was quarantined somewhere else because he was exposed to the virus and he got the health unit to make an exception to the no symptoms no test rule in the interest of the health of his wife and kid. The test came back negative 2 days later so he went home to help her. She did have a mental breakdown, he didn't go into detail about it but apparently she hadn't been handling the pandemic well and him being quarantined somewhere else made it worse. 

He asked me to delete the video because she saw me take it and I did. I told him I understand that this has been very hard on people and I had no hard feelings. He said hes going to look into counselling for her and it turns out they go to the same clinic as me so I recommended the counsellor I use. Counselling is basically the same as therapy here.

 He had stuck an apology letter from her in the mailbox with a garden center gift card.

423,423,I'm A Cleaning Lady Being Accused of Stealing in PA (contd FINAL),"To catch you up, in case you aren't following my story;
I clean for private residences in my local area. A year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""Mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. I was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! I have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. So I fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. For the last year, I've had to report to the court house monthly And sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that I would NOT accept a plea bargain. My public defender would really lay it on thick too. He would say things like, Sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? Being in jail for something you didnt do. He would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. I was never so afraid in my life! But in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. So we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before I went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-The Prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to NULLIFY!! What?! I damn near fell backwards!! Gone. All that stress, all that needless anxiety..GONE! In hindsight, looking into the matter, many Prosecutors do NOT want to actually go to trial with most cases. They WANT you to plea out so it's over and done with. But I stood my ground, and in my case, it worked out to my advantage. I wish the rest of you the best, thanks for everything, special thanks goes to u/JustNilt for Being so helpful!"
424,424,"[UPDATE] Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","I am gonna make up some names this time around because referring to people as ""the female seller"" or ""the tenant"" is cumbersome as hell.

After the mess on Wednesday, I met my realtor for dinner and to grab my closing docs. The seller's agent actually wound up stopping by as well (he arranged this with my guy) . He apologized profusely, told us he knows the family and he's confident we'll be able to get things sorted quickly. I didn't get my hopes up but he picked up our tab and bought a round of drinks while he was there, so hey, when life gives you lemons, make a superhuman amount of whiskey? I don't think that's accurate but it was my approach and I stand by it.

Anyway, I wound up speaking with the seller, Anne, yesterday morning, and got the rundown on the situation. It turns out the unwelcome tenant (Bill) is actually her nephew, not her ex's (Charlie). She was absolutely livid with Bill, and promised me the apartment would be vacant ASAP even if she had to physically drag him out herself and pay for movers to take all of his stuff. She also gave me assurances that she'd cover whatever this ordeal has cost. From there, she said she was going to check in with her sister (Diane) who was dealing with Bill as we spoke, and get back to me as soon as she knows something, but again promised that the absolute worst case scenario would be Bill starting to move out by early afternoon.

Maybe half an hour later she calls back and tells me that Diane had rented a truck and Bill was in the process of packing his stuff up. Turns out Bill had recently experienced something pretty fucking awful, and as a result had sort of become preoccupied with seeking approval from adult males. Charlie was at the top of this list; apparently his midlife crisis consisted of buying a Harley and trying to carry himself like a badass, and Bill bought the act hook, like and sinker. And a lot of you guys assumed correctly - Bill cooked up the scheme to basically extort me for a cash for keys deal. From what I was told, Charlie figured a doctor from NYC would just pay out right away to be done with it. For what it's worth, I am not an MD, nor am I from NYC... but you do you, Chuck. Anyway, at this point, Anne threw me a curveball. She and Diane were both at peace with the fact that I was going to pursue this with the police, but asked if I could meet Bill so he could look me in the eye to apologize because she wanted him get an understanding of the fact that his actions hurt a real, live human being. I agreed to it - I was hoping to see if I could get in to check the condition of the place anyway.

So yesterday evening I went up to the apartment and met ""my tenant"" as he was loading up the truck with his stuff. We wound up speaking for a while and... well, I am gonna disappoint some of you here. He seems like a genuinely good kid who got taken advantage of by a legitimate piece of garbage... there were a lot of tears, and innumerable apologies, and I 100% believe that these were based on genuine remorse for what he did, not regret about getting caught. I'll just say it here because I don't think I was being as slick as I'd hoped in dancing around it anyway, but the kid recently lost his father, and I don't see any reason to fuck up his life with a criminal record over a (ridiculously, incredibly) stupid mistake that he was to a great extent manipulated into making anyway. For whatever it's worth, if getting involved in a stupid scam like this was the worst thing that I did at nineteen... yeah let's just say that I was a remarkably stupid and reckless kid. I lucked out and never wound up getting caught in a situation that could have had significant legal consequences, but if I had and I hadn't been given a second chance, I'd be living a very different life right now.

As far as the money goes, Anne and I are going to figure out what's what, and I don't want to explain how because it involves details about her personal life, but the money will technically be coming out of Charlie's pocket anyway. She started by hiring some movers to unload my truck, which is taking place as I type this. Bill left the apartment in shockingly good condition, but I am basing that on what sort of damage nineteen year old me would have passively done to an apartment, so this may be a touch skewed haha. Either way, no damage has been done aside from some very minor cosmetic stuff (a couple of light scuffs from moving furniture and things like that), all of which would become immaterial when I redo the apartment in anticipation of renting it out, so I am not going to concern myself with any of that stuff.

As far as Charlie goes... well, I mentioned in a few comments that My Attorney (who is too majestically vicious for fake names so he just becomes capital-M-My capital-A-Attorney) is a super intense older guy and later found out is a ""retired"" civil litigator who can't sit still long enough to actually retire. Yeah he's out for fucking blood. Turns out Charlie does have himself some assets, and My Attorney is pretty confident that they will become my assets soon enough. I had a brief chat with one of the officers who came by on Wednesday (he's a friend of Diane's, apparently - this everyone knows everyone thing is still very foreign to me), and will be going by the station to issue a statement/file a report/whatever it is you do in this situation. Some of you expressed concerns that he may have fled the country, but the concept of Charlie leaving the county, let alone United States, is very funny to Anne, Diane and Officer Friend-of-Diane. Seems like Charlie is just a dumbshit who thought he could pull a fast one, and will be easy enough to find at one of the local watering holes when it's time for him to be picked up. I absolutely do not believe in throwing around assumptive diagnoses for fun, but I've made an exception in this case and decided that Charlie has full bore antisocial personality disorder because it makes me feel better about things for some reason. 

Anyway I have been typing this piecemeal throughout the afternoon which has essentially been a test of my wife's patience. I'm not dumb enough to incur the wrath of a tiny Puerto Rican woman who has spent the last couple of days stressed out of her mind, so I'm gonna call this a post. Thanks again to everyone on this sub for all of the advice given and sympathies expressed, I'm lucky as hell to have had this end the way it did.

425,425,Reporters are harassing us after a friend's tragic accident and posting inappropriate photos and quotes. What are our rights?,"I have a friend who was badly injured in a tragic accident. Somehow, the media was on the scene and took photos, splashing them over several outlets with a sensationalized title. They had been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. They camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. We called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

It has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. The last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. Finally, after the 5th call, I asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and injuries, so she can maintain her dignity. I also politely, but sternly, asked them to please stop calling everyone as we were still processing what happened. 

Of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. The one I spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. They did neither. The photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. I told them that I did not want anything I said to be published and that I am an anonymous friend. Instead, they made up quotes, saying that I said she was healing well when she was not. 

Even though I never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. After it was published, I got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when I did no such thing. I was nowhere near the accident. That took another few days to clear up but I felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

This happened in NYS. I have a very low opinion of reporters at the moment. They made my life and my friends' lives so much more difficult in an already difficult time, just to sell a sensationalized story. Do I have legal grounds to sue them for (1) harassing us (we have 2 official police reports with witnesses), (2) publishing nude photos without consent, and (3) misquoting under my full name without my permission?

*Edit to the 1st paragraph to make it more vague, as some have been able to deduce the story, which goes to show how widespread it was. Also, please do not PM requesting the full story. The point of my post was to figure out what to do with reporters that were harassing us. Isn't it ironic if you're doing the same? "
426,426,(IL) I [22F] was raped by a minor [16M],"(Illinois) Won't go into too much detail about the assault itself, but I (22F) was roofied and raped by a 16 year old, a friend of my brother. I was told that no one would believe me because I was the adult here.

I wouldn't report this if there is any chance I would be. Thanks!"
427,427,"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. I want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.","EDIT:
The title of this post inaccurately states my father was body-slammed. After a carefully talking to the family members present I realized this was not the case. The rest of this post remains unchanged.

A little background: 

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

I also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?"
428,428,Employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.,"My wife and I work for a hospital (Ontario, Canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. This will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

My wife and I both work off site, where parking is free. Also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

This seems like robbery to me... It has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

Is this even legal? How might I go about challenging this without sticking my neck out?"
429,429,I am left freezing cold in my apartment - As I pay more than 4X the monthly hydro bill of my neighbor,"In June of this year I moved into a one bedroom apartment in Ontario, Canada. My hydro bills were exceptionally high since moving in (averaging $300-$400 CAD per month). *I am a student - and cannot afford these ridiculously high prices!*

* I am extremely cautious about using electricity because of these high bills, so I rarely use the stove, and I only use lights when necessary. In the summer I had an air conditioner plugged in, and i would unplug it when leaving the house. 
* In the fall month when I did not have any heater or air-conditioner on for the entire month of October and was away from the house for over a week, my hydro bill was still $320. 
* This winter I have a small infrared heater plugged in at the very minimal setting of 15°C in the living room. I have closed the doors to the bedroom and bathroom and sleep on the couch beside the heater, as temperatures are getting to be extreme. I turn the heater off when i leave the house for extended periods of time. I do not use the heating provided in the building because baseboard heating would be absurdly expensive. 

&#x200B;

I had made a few complaints to my landlord (whom i have a number of other problems with and currently have a work order issued for them for other unrelated issues in the unit). I have also called my hydro provider and they told me that my unit has had a long history of high electricity charges and all the past tenants have called complaining about it. At this point I just thought that it might just be normal in the area and that I should give up.

&#x200B;

The other day as I was leaving my unit I ran into my neighbor right across from me. He asked my how I was doing... and how my heating was (since it was so cold outside). Of course I broke out complaining about how high my bills were and how cold I am all the time.

&#x200B;

**He looked at me surprised. He told me his bills have always been around $40-70. He let me step into his house, it was so warm! The guy had a heater set so high, all the doors were open and now I am extremely confused.** 

**He let me take a photo of his last hydro bill (the one where it was fall and I paid $320).**

[**Table I made comparing my neighbors October bill to mine**](https://imgur.com/a/hGDRF74)

&#x200B;

After finding out about my neighbors bill I am convinced that something suspicious is going on. There are only 4 apartment units in the building as we are on top of a restaurant. The third neighbor has also mentioned that their bill never exceeds $80, the fourth I have not spoken to extensively on the matter.

&#x200B;

I called Hydro again and they told me they could have an inspector come and shut off the hydro to the unit to see if anyone else is connected to my hydro - such as the restaurant.

&#x200B;

I am feeling a bit helpless and would like to know if there is anything further that I should do. And if I do discover that my hydro is being bypassed, will I be able to get my money back for all these months (adding up to well over $1000 of extra payments)?

&#x200B;

If the inspector finds that nothing else is connected to me - what other possible explanation could there be?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

&#x200B;

\****EDIT***!

\- Wow, thank you everyone who has contributed in helping me to solve this mystery! Comments are locked and I've been receiving a number of helpful messages - even electricians willing to come by and check things out!

&#x200B;

\- Basically everyone has agreed that my monthly bill makes NO sense what so ever and that there MUST be an external factor at play (something is connected off of my meter) - at this point, it is just a matter of what that factor could be.

&#x200B;

\- Some people have suggested it is the downstairs restaurant, my neighboring units, the hallway lights/security cameras. Others have suggested it may be that hydro is not accurately reading the meter or the wiring is not properly set up. I have no access to the meter itself to run any of the  tests that you guys have suggested - So I unfortunately will need to rely on the landlord for that.

&#x200B;

\- Some of you have suggested that I look on my online account for usage since I do not have access to a meter- However, others have said that in my area data is not fed directly into the Hydro company in real time - and that looking online may not give me the answers I need.  I am still trying to access my online account to see what's going on - I tried to make an account and it says that my meter number and account number do not match up? Even though I used the numbers from the bill. So I still need to wait until tomorrow to sort that out. 

&#x200B;

\- When the inspector comes by I assume he will uncover the underlying cause- I should be getting a call tomorrow  (2018-11-26) to figure out when the inspector comes.

&#x200B;

\- Since a lot of you have shown interest in what is to come - I will make an update post as soon as the mystery is solved!

&#x200B;

\- If for whatever reason I don't get a reduced bill - some of you have suggested I apply for a government assistance program to help pay the bill  [https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca](https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca/)  (I hope it does not come to that though)."
430,430,Old homeowners took the washer and dryer even though the offer they signed said they would leave it,"Pretty self explanatory. This is in Kansas. 

We just moved to the a new home yesterday. In the seller's disclosure, the washer and dryer were listed as ""negotiable"" and, since they were pretty nice, we went ahead and included them as part of our offer.

We went back and forth a few times but no one brought up the washer and dryer and eventually our offer was accepted. Yesterday, we got to our new house and they were gone.

We messaged our realtor, who pulled up the signed offer and confirmed the washer and dryer were supposed to be included. She asked the listing agent, who said they weren't supposed to be part of the sale, but were accidentally listed as negotiable. No one caught this or said anything and we were certain we would get them with the house.

My realtor is checking with her broker today, but what kind of recourse could we have here? Would this hold up in small claims court? Is it even worth it to try and get the washer and dryer back, or get a credit from the sellers for a new one? We're just low on cash at this point from the move and really don't need this right now.

I'm not sure if this should go under contracts or real estate, so please let me know if I need to change it. 

Thanks

UPDATE: the listing agent sent us $500 to put towards another set. We just took it and will use it towards a new purchase. Thanks everyone for the input! I'm glad we didn't need to fight over it."
431,431,"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution."

433,433,Trespassers called police on me for brandishing a firearm.,"Yesterday around 530 AM I heard a tapping on my window. My window faces my fenced in backyard which has a wooded area behind me. At first I thought it was a lizard but it was more rhythmatic. I went to look outside and as soon as I opened the curtains I see a hand tapping on my window. 

I then turned on my light and started to tap the barrel of my shotgun against the window. The trespassers saw it and immediately darted away. I call the police and a few minutes later they show up and ask where is the person with the gun.

I told them I have a gun and explained someone was trying to break in. They said they were called because someone was brandishing a weapon from inside their house, but I called and reported a break in, not on myself. Apparently the person I pointed the gun at, called the police. 

When I explained the situation, the officer kept trying to finish my story by saying ""You were ABOUT to shoot him until he darted away"" and they filed their report and left.

When I spoke to my sister she explained that the police were trying to help me avoid a brandishing charge because if I can say I had intent to fire versus intimidate then I can't say I was brandishing. 

I had no intention of killing anyone. What should I do? I don't know if I am going to have to defend against a brandishing charge, what about the trespassers? Is it brandishing when I am in my own house?

To make a long story short, hours after they got home she was laying in bed and my dad could hear her struggling to call for him. He called 911, by the time the medics arrived she was technically ""dead"" already, they did cpr in the house and on the way to the hospital. They managed to get a heartbeat but 35 minutes or so had passed already. A brain scan at the hospital showed lots of swelling and bleeding in the brain. She was placed on life support, but there wasn't anything they could do. From what I understand, her lungs stopped ""working/making oxygen"" which led to a heart attack. 

I'm crushed right now and still trying to process all of my emotions. It's just not sitting right with me that they released her that soon knowing that she was still having difficulty breathing etc after the lung biopsy."
436,436,"[Update] My dog got into a fight with a smaller dog. Owner asks for $1000 but won't show me vet bills. San Francisco, CA"," **Previous Post;**

&#x200B;

This happened couple of months ago and I forgot to update you guys. I guess, I just wanted to forget what happened.

Here is the rundown of what I did and what the outcome was.

&#x200B;

I started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and I asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

We went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. He failed and my lovely boy is next to me now."

I know no one one Reddit can give me all the answers but I’m wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

I also know that there are a ton of points where I should I should have said stop and asked for another stylist but I’ve never had a bad experience with these people and I’m kind of shy about speaking up. 

I had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that I’ve been growing out for 3+ years.  My hair is directly tied to my income, I’m a (hair) model and I’d say I’m probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs I can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). This isn’t including income I would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (I made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

A week ago, I went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch TRIM. This isn’t a Great Clips or Sports Clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. The amount I wanted off was specified both when I made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

I have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. I was assigned a new stylist instead (I wasn’t notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). Everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying I noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). I pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). At this point I was angled away from the mirror. Halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which I now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). I looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. This was probably when I really should have stopped them, but once again I had faith in the salon and five inches wasn’t a huge deal because my hair was so long. When they came back I specifically asked NO shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

I was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and I just hear her mutter “crap” under her breath. I immediately told her to stop and show me the back. I have NO clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my NECK. I asked to speak to a a manager and I was in tears at this point. 

The manager was really kind and explained she was new. But when I started crying she was rather rude saying “it’s JUST hair it will grow back, you don’t need to be making a scene” things along that line. I was really panicked at this point. She offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but I wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

The next day I went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when I was younger and he was shocked. He said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn’t have someone who would eff up that bad and he’d ask around. He also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. I just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style I have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

Then today my moms stylist called me back (he’s been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn’t qualified to work there. He said I should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

The original salon has not called me back at all, but I was fairly rude leaving. 

Question is, is this worth pursuing? I feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it’s just hair. I’m also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn’t a full time career. I just don’t know what to do at this point."
438,438,"FedEx threw a package over my fence, damaged my car and is mishandling my complaint. They are ignoring it. What should I do?","As the title says, FedEx threw a 10lbs. Box over my 6ft fence and damaged my brand new car.

I called 4 times to get hung up on. Each time I waited an hour on hold.

I finally got through and the employee took down my name, email and phone number and said I would be contacted in within 48hrs by my local branch.

72 hours passed so I called back the 1-800 number again. Two hours on hold and the person on the other end asked me for my case number. I was never given a case number, only that I would be called...

Turns out the first person did not file my complaint for damaging my car and I had to start all over with my complaint. They again, took down my info.

I Asked for a timeframe for when I would receive a follow up and they said they would be in touch, gave me a case number and hung up.

I’ve spent 7 hours on the phone with FedEx. I can’t keep calling back. Damages amount to $800-$1000. This is in California, USA.

Should I call the police and file report? What should I do? Please help.

Thank you.

EDIT: I was actually sitting in my car on a video call when this happened. While I didn’t catch this incident on camera, my co-worker did hear and somewhat see everything happen. Including the size of the box and me trying to get the FedEx drivers attention, but he ran to the truck.

EDIT 2: I tried to escalate the matter over the phone and speak with a manager but after asking multiple times, I only got “due to covid-19 we can’t do that, I’m here helping you now.” When I would ask to speak with specific departs, I would get the same response.

EDIT 3: I DONT have Twitter. I only have Reddit.

EDIT 4: Estimate damage is $754 using OEM parts and labor.

EDIT 5: Got off the phone with non-emergency police line. They told me to file as vandalism and were very helpful. Going to do that now.

EDIT 6: Thank you for all the answers, this greatly helps. Going to contact my insurance, get an estimate, and file an incident report."

Second update; I met with the manager today and he said he will do anything to make this up to us and keep it from being talked about outside of the hotel. Whatever that means. I just thanked him and told him I'd call if I need anything. Thank you everyone for al your replies. It's not the end of the world, just extremely dangerous and negligent on their part. I spent most of the night crying thinking what happens now, do I relapse, but luckily I woke up feeling normal and just as committed to my sobriety as I was before that gulp... his comments make me think he or the boys are afraid of something happening. I don't know what, but if there is something more I can do to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone again I want to do it, like contacting the departments you guys have provided in the comments. Thank you again.

The first time, I messaged their security and got an extremely apologetic phone call with an invite to come back for a few nights and a comped several hundred dollar dinner in one of their restaurants. MORE THAN KIND, right? He said they could get in a lot of trouble for this, so they wanted to make it up to me.

It's night 2 of my stay here and I ask a waitress for a sprite with mint and lime, I was clear I didn't want a Virgin mojito just in case that was too confusing for the bartender.. a few minutes pass.. She gives it to me, and like an idiot, I take a big gulp. Yup. That's right. Going on 4 years sober and I just swallowed my second gulp of booze, thanks to the same hotels inability to idk, make a soda?

What do I do? I had to unfortunately go through weeks of counseling after the last mistake. I just feel absolutely let down and disgusted with myself and whatever bartender made my sprite..


Update; the head of the alcoholic beverage department called the manger on staff back, which is surprising because it's midnight. He said he'd appreciate if we don't go home, as he will come in the morning to speak to us because he feels this has escalated to a dangerous situation for both the hotel and me. I have no clue what that means but I'm assuming the video they found of them pouring booze into my cup, then the video of the waitress clearly telling me my drink was Virgin has something to do with it, or the fact that this mistake is the exact reason they even invited me back..... who fucking knows. They just had me fill out a statement. I have the drink here in the room with me. Idk why. I just need to sleep, I've been crying on and off for hours because yet again I'm left wondering if 3 years and change of sobriety is now down the drain.... and I need to to forget the taste of that strong ass drink going down my stupid ass throat."

I told them I couldn't resign so they stood up and walked me out the front door."
442,442,Parents recorded my Zoom class and is threatening to sue me and go after my credential because they disagree with my teaching style.,"I am a teacher in California and a student's parents recorded my Zoom class (minors too) without consent.

They are threatening me and my school with litigation and said they will go after my credential.

I do not do a lot of lecture over zoom (I record myself and upload it for the students to work on asynchronously) and instead spend class time for students to work together in break out rooms so they can help one another and learn from each other. In my view this also gives students a bit of the social aspect that they are missing being all at home.

The parents of a student cursed me out and berated me for not knowing what I am doing, and other insults/disparaging statements. They also told me that my class should be 90% lecture. Everything I do based upon state standards/concepts--it just seems they are basing a legal case, or a threat of a legal case, off an opinion.

Do they have a case? Should I worry? It cannot be legal for them to record my class, and other people's children, without consent."

My wife and I recently signed a lease on a new apartment. We have paid rent on the old apartment up until January 31st so we are not fully moved out yet. We still have some belongings at the old place and haven't finished cleaning it. Our lease ends on Feb 1st. We told our landowner we would be moving around January 8th, so that he would have time to find a new tenant. I already told him that if he wanted someone to move in before the end of January he would have to give us the pro-rata rent for the rest of the month, and give us enough notice to fully move out, and he agreed. I just got a voicemail from him telling me he has someone moving into our old place in THREE HOURS and that they're not refunding our deposit because the blinds are dirty and the garden needs weeding (both things we were going to do before the end of the month of course). Our deposit was $1200. To really rub salt in the wound, the place was a shitheap when we moved in and we made many improvements to it at our own cost, such as fixing broken windows, repainting dirty walls, replacing broken fixtures etc. We have lived there for 2 years and he has consistently told us what excellent tenants we are and how much he appreciates the care we take of the property.

445,445,Got robbed at Walmart by someone who I think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy,"Posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.  

Tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. This is a side account I randomly created years ago.

I am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in PA.   
The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.

In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.

The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!

Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was

Heads up this situation has gotten out to the rest of the store (Not surprising)

Any advice on this situation?

446,446,I just found some pornographic photos of me as a child at my fathers house. I don’t know what to do. TEXAS,"I had to make a throwaway account to avoid being identified. 

I am at a loss for words right now. I feel like my entire existence has been a lie. I have lived for 28 years and now I feel like I even know who I am anymore. 

I was helping my dad and stepmom clean up for a garage sale. I was in the attack and was going through a bunch of old boxes that hadn’t been touched in years. I was looking through one box and there were some photos of me with aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members on my dads side. I had never seen these pictures so I looked through them all. After a few photos, they were just photos of me. Usually alone on a bed. Then there were photos of me naked. And I was crying. I dont really want to go into detail of the rest of the photos I saw. 

My parents were divorced, so this must have happened during Christmas or summer break since that’s when I had visits with my dad. My mom is going to be devastated. I don’t want her to blame herself. She tried hard to allow my dad custody. He was physically abusive towards her, he was wealthy so I guess he had a good lawyer. 

I’m not really sure what my next steps are here. Do I report this? I never had any behaviors from this alleged abuse nor did I have any PTSD because I never knew I was abused. My mind is all over the place and I just feel lost."

One girl brought in a pie and was very proud of herself, saying I could eat it. So I did because I’m a trusting idiot. My stomach was a wreck that night and the next day but I’m pregnant and have a weird stomach anyways so I didn’t connect the dots. There’s been some other shit since and I’m on even stricter rules right now.

I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn’t when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I’m so so upset right now. I genuinely don’t know what to do or say. They’ve ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn’t take it seriously and this is just my breaking point. I’m not coming back after I have this baby but is there something I can do legally?

449,449,"[Update] [Virginia] - I caused an accident, lady I hit refuses to take payout from Insurance, thinks I should pay because I need to ""learn my lesson""","Original thread here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/612803/richmond_va_i_caused_an_accident_a_year_and_a/

The lady I hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. In June they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

In the middle of June she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. I got a letter from the law firm telling me that I was going to be sued if I did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

I kicked the letter off to my insurance company; I first called then emailed it: My adjuster that I was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after I read him the letter. Then a strained chuckle. ""We will take care of this.""

I heard back from them on Wed the 5th - They sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. They apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of June to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

My adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. She has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. According to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: Primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a VERY high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. He collected on her behalf and took his cut.

That's all I know, so yeah. Issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. "
450,450,"Radiology center mistakenly put ""opioid dependence"" as my diagnosis, and won't remove it from my medical record.","Several months ago, I had some imaging done at a radiology center I'd never been to before.  When I checked the results and report online (which were sent to my referring provider), I see that under the Problem section of the medical record created for me, I was given the diagnosis of ""opioid dependence, on agonist therapy."" There was no basis for this diagnosis, as the radiology center only had the referral for imaging and basic demographic information I'd filled out.  Having a diagnosis of opioid dependence can have very damaging effects in my profession, as my employer is granted access to my medical information, as well as my malpractice provider; and it will follow me in my medical records with any application for any insurance product.

The radiology center apologized for the error, but has left the acknowledged false diagnosis in my medical record adding the word ""inactive"" to it.  I explained that this is still very problematic, as any reader (employer, governing body of my profession, insurance company) will still see ""opioid dependence"" as a diagnosis, and I will not be there to explain that it was an error.  They have since ignored all of my emails.

Do I have any legal recourse to have them remove the error they acknowledged making, which I am really concerned will negatively affect my employment and livelihood (as it is now also part of my medical record at the referring provider).

451,451,Working forcing me to give them (not donate) my blood (Pennsylvania),"Hello legaladvice

I know the answer to ""can my work fire me for....."" is almost always yes in the U.S., but this seems really wrong.

I'm a phlebotomist in a hospital in Pennsylvania. I report to the laboratory supervisor. Recently I had to have some tests done. We are given a discount for having things that like done in our own hospital so of course I did. For medical privacy, I'd prefer not to go into what exactly, but it turned out I have something rare about my blood. I never told anyone this at work, but everyone found out anyway. My supervisor approached me excitedly, saying that they have to calibrate some kind of analyzer pretty frequently and that my blood worked as a positive control to save on some expensive chemical they have to buy to normally calibrate it. I laughed this off thinking she used my blood once to calibrate her machine. It turns out she is expecting to take my blood on a regular basis (at least weekly is the impression I got) to calibrate this machine. When I told her I wasn't ok with that, she got upset and stormed off to her office. She called me in later and told me I would be saving the lab a ton of money if I did this. I once again told her no. Now she has started dropping hints that the lab is in financial trouble and cuts will have to be made. I asked around to other phlebotomists and she hasn't said anything to them about these cuts.

So anyway, can my work force me to give them my blood?"

He has grown up in an abusive household and is underweight as they never fed him. Three weeks ago she dropped him off at our house to stay the night and hasn't returned. At this point it's the best thing for him and he is in no way an inconvienece. He is totally welcome to stay. However, he has one set of clothes and I have been trying to reach his family to get him his stuff but nobody is responding. I really don't know where to start. I want to call police to get his things, but I don't want him to get placed into a foster family. He is in a very fragile state and I wouldn't want to do that to him. Where do I start? What should I be looking to do? I have no way to get him any help because I am not his legal guardian. I really want to get him some counseling and help with school. So, how do I help him? He is currently 15 if that helps and we live in WA state. Any help would be much appreciated.


UPDATE:

Thank you so much for the outpouring of support. I drove him to his house today and spoke with his mother. His mother told him he had 10 minutes to get everything he needed and to get out. So I got to deal with a very hurt child this morning. I think the resounding answer here was to get a family lawyer. So that's what I am going to do. I am going to sit down and document everything I saw. I am also gonna ask that he do the same. He is a teenager and deserves a stable environment which I believe my family can provide. So the end game is that we at least get temporary custody of him until he is an adult. My son has been great through this entire thing and has really stepped up and showed how caring he is. Without him, I wouldn't know half the stuff going on. So I guess we gained a new family member today. I'm happy that he's here, yet disappointed in the situation."
453,453,Getting evicted because of snoring problem.,"*I originally posted this somewhere else and some suggested I post it here. Based in NYC*


My boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.

After 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is “old” with medical issues, he said there’s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.

We have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn’t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.

The next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we’d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their “safety”. 

So we’ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our “loud talking” at night.

My question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused. There is no way we’re going to find another apartment in 30 days."

There is so much more that goes into this than just $30k worth of missing things. She asked if the DA is going to take the case he said they could but he advised her to contact her atty Monday before making that decision. 

The lake association had their monthly meeting. At which time the president informed everyone that the no trespassing signs weren’t real. So my take on the neighbors is they are just assholes.

456,456,[VA] My roommate was murdered in our house and the police took a lot of my property as evidence and now will not return my calls.,"My roommate was shot and killed late last year while I was in the mountains with my girlfriend. The police took a lot of things in the course of their investigation, including my legally purchased pistol, laptop, and the SD card out of my camera. No one has been charged in the investigation, which I'm not surprised about honestly. But the police refuse to return my calls about the return of my stuff. What can I do to get my shit back?"
457,457,Biomother of my foster son wants to sue me for vaccinating (MD),"Hey all. This might come out jumbled since I just got an email about this and I'm very frazzled. I'm sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

My wife and I (also a woman) are fostering a baby boy who is almost two. He was taken from his birth mother because of some child neglect and his mother went to jail. We have been fostering him for nearly six months and are planning on adopting him, unless his mother can make a bid for custody back. She currently doesn't have a steady job and her housing situation is iffy as best so I do not think that is likely. How biological father is unknown.

My son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). He was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. We realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

Last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. He (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. She said we violated her religious rights. (Religion has never come up before.)

We kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). She's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). But today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. He hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

Can she really take us to court? Does she have a case? My wife said I'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but I'm not so sure. What documents do I need to make my case?

Edit: thank you all for the advice! (My wife is now using it to say ""I told you so."") We emailed the caseworker but haven't heard anything yet; it's a Saturday though, so we'll probably hear from him on Monday or Tuesday. I'll let you know if anything changes."
458,458,Somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - FL,"While vacationing in Key West, FL in February 2018, I was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my California drivers license, and my health insurance cards. I reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name. Apparently I'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the Gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. I'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, OBs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ERs, when I receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long NICU stay for a baby girl. 

In reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. They keep telling me that I need to physically come meet with them, which is fair I suppose, but I live in California and I work, so it's not like I can just hop on over to a random part of Florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. I have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

I reached out to the local police where I live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. I was unable to file a report in Florida, Key West citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and Alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". I reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--I didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. I have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. I reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well. 

At this point, I'm nearly 40k in debt from this garbage, my credit is in the toilet, I'm in debt and financially hurting myself from unrelated medical bills I now have to pay out of pocket. I'm losing my mind at this point and I don't know what to do."
459,459,Can a cab driver legally drive me to the bank without my consent?,"Alright, so I took a cab this morning to get to work. I didn't have any cash on me, only cards, but taxis in my city take cards. When I got to my workplace, he realized his machine wasn't working, so he asked me if there was an ATM in the hotel. There isn't, cause we take cards?!?! So he said: well guess we're going to the bank and took off without me agreeing.

The bank he got to was not mine, so I had to pay a $4 fee on top of pulling out a $20. I was so rushed because I was gonna be late for work that I dropped one of my very expensive gloves on the ground. He ended up driving me back to work, blaming me for the whole thing. 

Can they actually force me to do that? He didn't have a gun to my head or anything but threatened to call the cops and having the cops show up at my work place would be really bad for me. Can they just drive off without your consent? Thank you"
460,460,"Gave my two weeks and my new employer is rescinding due to ""company restructuring ""","Half writing this to get advice, half to hear what outcomes I should expect.

I  was offered a role for a frontend dev position at a company. The  company put me through 2 phone interviews, a coding project, and a 3hr  in person interview, at the end of which I was offered a job the next  week. I took it and signed their offer letter. Also had to go to the  doctor for a drug test last week. In addition they made me sign a  confidentiality agreement, which is kind of funny now.

Today  they called me and said due to restructuring a lot of things will be  changing at the company. They weren't clear on their intentions. I had  to seek clarifications and asked them to send it in writing today to  both myself and my recruiter. They haven't yet. They called my recruiter  and left it grey with them. Basically saying, they are taking away my  offer, which I had to pry out of their HR person.

I  gave my two weeks last week, so I'm unemployed come Friday... I guess.  My current job is decent and I never would have done this knowing. The  new employer offered to reach out to my HR team at my current job. It  feels too late to turn around since my current employer knows I'm  willing / looking to leave. Also their off boarding has already started.  I don't think going back is the right move at this point.

I  guess I'm curious what to do in this situation and if the new company  is liable for damages. At the moment my recruiter is reaching out to  gain clarifications and we will go from there tomorrow.

The  negligence from the new company is sort of outstanding from my point of  view. Feels like this new employer is making me unemployed and do not  have to face any repercussions."
461,461,UPDATE [CA] Parents took and sold my car and won’t tell Me who to. What’s the best step to take from now.,"Thanks for the replies when I [originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77vzo6/ca_parents_took_and_sold_my_car_and_wont_tell_me/).

All I needed was a more with-it police officer. I went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. The officer I dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

I had my car back within two days. My parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. The car was retrieved from the rentee's house. I hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. My mother has been charged, and I've also been questioned about my parents drug use. I'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

I'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

As a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. He'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. I have my car back and my brother back more than I did before.

462,462,Hospital sent my deceased baby home with me,"
Located in California 

This happened nearly a year ago and I'm very seriously considering suing but I'm not sure I have a case. Here's the backstory. 

I was 16.5 weeks pregnant and went into what was very clearly early labor. Strong and steady contractions lasting about 30 seconds every few minutes. I went to my hospital's emergency room and was admitted immediately. They spent hours checking on my vital functions and giving me ultrasounds for my organs before they finally checked on my baby. I continually asked to be transferred to the antepartum unit for proper care for me and the baby but was denied. By the time the doctor confirmed I was indeed an early labor hours later and she was ready to physically examine me it was too late and my baby was still born. 

After her birth it was clear that I was going to need a D&C to remove the placenta, at which point the question arose about what to do with my daughter's body. After several back and forth discussions the hospital staff informed me that they would refuse to keep her body in the morgue on premises and that we would need to take her with me for the D&C and they would not arrange for the local mortuary to pick her up from the hospital. We directly called the mortuary ourselves and they said they would come pick her up if the hospital would hold her at the morgue, which again the hospital refused to do. The hospital staff told us at that point are only option was for us to take our baby to the mortuary ourselves. My husband had to sit in the waiting room outside the operating room with our baby in the plastic bucket. After my procedure I was discharged and sent home with our baby's body in the plastic bucket. 

The mortuary was completely baffled as to why the hospital would not hold my baby's body. A few weeks after all of this settled down we met with the hospital risk manager and the ER director who both admitted that they did the wrong thing."
463,463,"[Wyoming] Roommate exposed us to toxic radon gas, what can I do legally?","I (26F) live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my (19M) roommate. My roommate has a collection of clocks and old electronics he keeps in a case in his bedroom. I received my radon detector from a friend three days ago. He had high radon levels (5 pCi/l) in his house, but got it mitigated and now it's down below 1 pCi/l, and wanted to give it to me as he didn't need it anymore. I turn it on, and after the warm up period, see that it's reading 224 pCi/l (not 2.24) in the main room. I move it to my bedroom (close to his) and it's maxing out at over 500 pCi/l in my bedroom. My apartment lobby reads at around 3.5 pCi/l. I did some research and the radium clocks do emit radon, but not nearly enough to cause that big of a spike in radon levels.

I question him when he gets back from work, and he panics a bit, and tells me that he has around 13.5 millicuries of radium. He shows me the cabinet, and there's a vial of radium paint, a lot of shavings in glass jars, lots and lots of clocks and gauges, what he calls ""Soviet radium scales"", old US Army radium disks, and other items with radium. It's obvious how the apartment was contaminated, and I worry the radon is leeching into the rest of the apartments. He's been here and had his collection for over a year. Levels this high are basically unheard of and can cause cancer with ease, so I'm worried I might lose my life over this. Obviously this isn't my landlords fault, it's the roommate, so what do I even do here? Does something like this break the lease and get my roommate and all his radium kicked out? Can I sue him if I get lung cancer out of this? What is my next step?"
464,464,City removed all plants from our Hillside in the backyard promising to replant them 4 months ago (which they didn't) and it stormed causing our house to flood and destroyed our backyard.,"My City of San Clemente, California decided to remove all plants from our hillside in the Summer ""due to fire concerns"" which resulted in our House getting incredibly dirty from all the dust which was rampant without all the plants. We reached out to the city many times with letters urging them to right the wrong and they promised to replant in the Fall. It is now almost December and a storm came today that has completely flooded our backyard and is doing property damage to our house.

This could never have happened if they left all the plants on the hill. Is there anything we can do for compensation to pay for the damages caused by their lack of action and failure to uphold their promise in the letter they wrote us? All help is greatly appreciated since we cannot afford to take care of these damages.

Edit: Not sure if this is important but the hillside is maintained by our HOA of the community we live in and was a joint decision by the city and HOA to remove the plants."
465,465,Had to call CVS corporate office to complain about a pharmacist. She found out and is now withholding my medications out of spite. Need advice.,"Two days ago, I went to my local CVS to pick up a prescription. For the last year, I have been able to pick up my refills 24-48 hours in advance with no problem at all. This is so I don't run out of my meds and can take my first dose of my new script on the day that I would have been out. Simple enough right? well, this is where my story begins. This time, the pharmacist refused to refill my script and was forcing me to wait until I was completely out. I asked why the sudden change because I have always got my refill 24-48 hours early this whole time. She said that I never would have been able to which is a complete lie. I said check my records and look because it's always the way it has been. she didnt even bother and repeated that I would have never been able to do that. 

Well, I went home without my new meds. Once I got home, I looked up the policy and indeed, it's company policy that I can indeed pick up my meds 48 hours early. So, I call them back and say, look, this is indeed company policy,and then she started to get pissed and told me to just go somewhere else then if I didn't like it. I called the CVS customer support group and told the support rep about this. The rep contacted the store and when the rep came back on the line, she said that the pharmacist has deleted all my scripts from their records at my request. Thing is, I never once asked them to do that. She was the once that said I can go somewhere else but i never even hinted that I agreed to that. They are now retaliating and refusing to refill any of my scripts because I had made a complaint. I called them this morning and the lady straight up hung up on me. I don't understand why this is happening and Ive never had an issue like this with a pharmacy ever in my life.

So, here I am all out of my very much needed meds and they are still refusing to refill my scripts because I inconvenienced them and now they are holding my health and scripts hostage. I don't know what to do or where to turn. Is there any laws that would prohibit them from behaving like this? it seems like their behavior is illegal. Is there any legal avenue I could take against them? Any advice on this topic would be much appriciated."

First things first, I went down to the Chesapeake General District Court on Thursday and filed a civil suit against my roommate for over $2500. I overnighted my copy of the summons to him, and when they arrived on Friday, I slid it under his door since it is technically his mail. Also, when I got home from work last night, I noticed that the sheriff's office had left their copies of the summons attached to the screen door. At the advice of the civil clerk of court, I am not touching it.

I have an update on my car as well. I received a phone call from the collision center yesterday, and my vehicle is ready to be picked up. I am excited that I am going to be back into my own car.

Last, but not least, I am pretty sure that my roommate has moved out early, even though he wasn't due to move out on the first. The only reason I say this is because he hasn't been here in 2 1/2 days, and the security camera he had watching his vehicle is not in his window anymore.

Thank you all for the support. I will make sure to keep y'all updated on the civil case."
467,467,[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not. 

&#x200B;

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents. I, however, do not care what happens to them –– I have forgiven them once before for crossing the line with credit cards, so I do not care what happens to them now."

I got a call this morning telling me that my daughter's mother had passed away; no other details at this time, most likely an overdose. 

I've recognized it as an inevitability, but I also hoped for a miracle for our girl's sake if not her own. You always cheer for people you loved at one point and especially so in this case. 

It's mixed relief and deep sadness. Legally there are going to be some things down the line here that will fall to me to deal with on behalf of our kid and I'm sure it'll come with questions I'll rely on you for. 

Our girl doesn't know yet; I let her sleep in this morning and she's still asleep. I don't know how I'm going to tell her and that's the part that gets me. She's going through some stuff of her own right now and this was the last thing I wanted for her."

470,470,UPDATE: I am the mother who disbelieved her daughter’s sexual abuse.,"More than a year ago, I posted a message here on the advice of my son. I’m not sure how to link it but you can view my post history. Location is Washington.

My daughter disclosed sexual abuse to me from my now ex husband, and in shock, I made every mistake possible. Not only did I doubt her, I was convinced she was lying. 

There is no excuse, but my children are better than I deserve. I knew immediately that I had to reevaluate. The day after I first posted, I rented a room away from my husband. I called my daughter on the phone and we spoke for hours. We both cried and I apologized. If we were in the same city, I would have thrown myself on my knees. I told her I loved her and she said, “I know. I love you too.” She asked me to see a therapist and I agreed. I also called my son and thanked him for being there for his sister when her own mother was not.

My children actually suggested this update, although they understandably want details about legal proceedings to be kept private. I still feel both disgust for myself and awe that I have their forgiveness and love despite how I failed them both, but we have worked through so much pain and we are a family. 

Thank you for your honesty and being the first to open my eyes."
471,471,"[MA] Landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. Cites ""illegal activity"". Does he technically have a case?","So, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

Do I need to take this seriously, or can I start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? What should I do if he does try to take further action?"
472,472,Neighbor took our dog to the pound without telling us,"This is happening in Maryland.

My neighbor trespassed in our back yard this morning and took our dog, a Jack Russel Terrier, to the shelter. We have her on video from our outdoor cameras taking her.

She admits to taking her, but is refusing to tell us where the dog is, she simply said the dog was at the pound, in the shelter, etc.

The police have been less than helpful with this situation, and we are in the process of contacting all the shelters in our area about her actions.

What are we capable of doing from a legal perspective in this case?

UPDATE: Dog has been located at a shelter, who have agreed to return the dog to our care after seeing the camera footage to prove she was stolen. Motive still remains unclear on the neighbors side.

UPDATE 2: A lot of questions about the dogs living conditions.

She is fed, healthy, regularly walked, active, and sees a veterinarian once annually. People in our neighborhood see our dog walking almost every day, so they’d back us up on the dogs living conditions.

The dog is considered an indoor dog, but gets a lot of outside playtime, and as stated before, she is regularly walked. We have NEVER left her out of the house at night, in the rain, snow or anything of that sort. We have also never left her outside when we aren’t home.

This morning she was let outside so she could use the bathroom, and run around a little bit, but none of us were watching from the windows, we have high fences with no gaps and a gate so she can’t escape so we aren’t superstitious about leaving her unattended.

UPDATE 3: Our dog is back home with us now. We have acquired surrender documents from the shelter and they prepared us a copy of their security footage of the neighbor on a flash drive.
The documents are written as if she was the owner of the dog. Stating she “can’t afford her anymore”

We have spoken to police again, this time at the county level. We filed a report with them and my parents are pressing charges. 

There was however one problem, the woman tried to find and remove the microchip which is implanted in our dog. There were cuts in the dogs skin that the shelter employees discovered while trying to scan the chip. Our dog needed bandages, which the shelter applied. The chip is intact, and is still implanted, but I am pissed that she went as far as to try to do that herself.

We have not spoken to the neighbor since leaving but we are not letting our dog outside alone for a long time, and one commenter suggested putting locks on our gates, which we plan to do."

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted. I'm bruised and broke, but you should see the other guy (I know he spent over $150k in legal fees alone). 


Edit: Case was in Federal Court, Louisiana.


Edit 2: since the update threads are locked by default, I'm going to add here my advice for others in similar situations, since it appears to be a common question in the PMs I'm getting.


First: look really hard into getting a lawyer, even if only for initial settlement negotiations. A lawyer MAY get your case dismissed in the incipient phase. The initial month I used a lawyer gave me the general direction I followed after. It helped me discover some of the tools I needed to use later. Unfortunately, my former employer got stubborn and it became a pissing contest. 

Things I've learned and I recommend: Read (download) the Rules of civil procedure, and the local court rules. Do not let deadlines pass! Better file something incorrectly than not file, when an answer or action is expected of you. You will have the chance to fix errors later. Have a witness(es) willing to write a declaration stating that your version is correct. Use affidavits/declarations to get your evidence admitted. Also - read the Rules of evidence!

Submit subpoenas, and take depositions! This is what ultimately helped me!

Good luck, all! "
475,475,"I'm in accounting, I uncovered serious fraud by my employer and they fired me. How do I report it and how do I protect myself?","I work in accounting in a private company. Two weeks ago I was given documents to work on. I wasn't supposed to have access to these documents. Actually they were given to me by my manager because he wasn't doing his job. He was very late on something, which often happens, and asked me to take care of it instead. I did and started suspecting something was wrong as there were fishy discrepancies with invoices. I investigated a little on the side, which I now regret doing. It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer ""for safety reasons"", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.

Now I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything. And if I do this I'm scared I may be considered an accomplice because at first I hadn't noticed that some things they were doing were illegal and there's proof I authorized some payments.  I did what I was told and didn't suspect anything but I don't know how that could look like for an investigator. There's also the question of confidentiality if I talk to someone about company matters. The files that I accessed during my ""investigation"" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either. Could I be prosecuted or sued for this?

Then there's the matter of me being fired, it's putting me in a very difficult situation. I think it's retaliation but I don't know what to do with this. Can I file for unemployment?

I'm in this way over my head, any help will be greatly appreciated.

476,476,Hospital gave my Mom's jewelry to another patient.,"My mom, (84 y/o) recently suffered a stroke and was in ICU for 3 weeks. She went in wearing her wedding ring a diamond/24ct gold bracelet and other gold jewelry. (Approx $4000 worth of jewelry). The hospital staff gave my dad (86 y/o) a bag with her personal items in it. My dad suffers from dementia and is not fully mentally there. When one of my sister's took a look inside the bag, (which was a few days later), she noticed that there was a separate bag for the jewelry but this bag did not have my mom's name on it it had a different person's name on it and it was cheap costume jewelry. 

&#x200B;

We notified the hospital and gave them the jewelry that did not belong to my mom and asked what they were going to do about her jewelry. We were told that the only thing they can do is wait to see if the person it was given to returns it, if they do then the hospital will notify us, if not then they were not going to take any further action. 

&#x200B;

One option my mom can do is file a claim with her Home Owner's carrier, unfortunately she has jewelry limitation of $1000 and none of her jewelry was scheduled so she would be out the amount over the limit. We have filed a police report but they aren't going to do anything about it, we just filed it for insurance purposes. 

&#x200B;

This happened in Washington State. I'm not sure what else we can do. My mom still cannot speak or write so she can't give any sort of statement. She is cognitive though, enough to know that her jewelry is gone."
477,477,Priest broke confession seal and told husband I cheated,"I cheated on my husband three years ago while traveling for work. It was a one night stand and we didn’t exchange numbers or keep in contact. I don’t even know his last name. 


Until last month, I’ve never told anyone about this event. At the time I cheated, I didn’t really care because my marriage was rocky and I felt unappreciated. But my husband and I reconnected during quarantine and I started to feel extremely guilty. 


Last month, I thought I would try going to confession with my parish priest. He said I needed to tell my husband as part of my penance. I wasn’t really sure how to do that, so I’ve sat on it. 


Last weekend I came home to my husband throwing all of my stuff out of the bedroom and trying to kick me out of the house. He knows everything. Apparently the priest followed up to see if I’d told my husband, and when my husband said he didn’t understand what the priest was talking about, he told my husband about the affair. 


My whole world is exploding because I thought confession was supposed to be private. Does the priest have any kind of liability or responsibility?

478,478,"[Texas] I am a felon. I was hired through a ""Temp agency"" that helps people find jobs. I let them know that I had a felony upfront. Worked for a warehouse, was offered a permanent position. Signed an ""offer of employment letter"" then was fired because of my record after the 2nd background check.","As the title says. I am a felon. {Less than a gram charge in 2013-I was a 22yr old punk...} I am now a 28 year old man, and that life is long behind me. I paid the Piper in FULL for it all and have been deeply humbled.

With that being said, I was completely honest with the agency with my record, I made sure they knew this. 100%

This job finally stuck. It was a performance numbers based job. I received electronics and entered information into a computer. You were suppose to scan 8-10 items an hour with a certain error rate.

I always made my numbers. Was even one of the top ""receivers"" on the floor. I averaged 120-150ish scans a day, my error rate was very low maybe 3 ""tags""(errors) in total. because I wanted to prove my worth.

I was never late. Never called in. Came to work and produced. 

My manager was even a family friend that got me the job. He knows my whole history. 

The only reason I posted this was because my old man called me up and said he spoke to his friend who is a really smart 22yr Veteran of the Military. (So is my pops) about my situation. The friend mentioned to my old man that it sounded like ""discrimination"" and I should see a lawyer.

I signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check I received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. Even though I was upfront with my record.

Do I have any kind of legs here? Or is this just what I should expect until I can get my record expunged? 

Kinda shitty man. This job was the best thing that happened to me... I was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. Idk. I don't want any boo hoo's for me. I know I'm a good person.

I felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. I understand if I provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. But I knew I had something to prove and I did just that. Which is why they offered me the position.

I was in that warehouse for 3 months... There background check went back 7 years....

This really set me back financially and honestly my manhood was defeated a bit, but that's life.


Is there anything here for me to pursue? 

Thanks to anyone that can help. Have lovely day everyone!

Thank you!,"So after some research and still not quite understanding the law here in Florida, I made  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/afjeis/im_an_exempt_employee_in_the_state_of_florida_my/) a little while ago.  The answers were right along the lines of what I was thinking and gave me the confidence to go to my employer and demand payment.  I was a little worried about retribution, but I figured the law was on my side so wth?

Not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  No signs of retribution either.  It turned out (at least this is what I'm being told, so who really knows?) that the HR manager misinterpreted the law.  Once this person read it again, they started to have doubts themselves, then contacted our corporate lawyers who told the HR manager that we must be paid.

480,480,"The guy we're living with threatens to kick my mom and I out of his apartment if she doesn't have sex with him. She and I are not on the lease, and we have little money and no where else to go. Can law enforcement help us?","My mom and I have been living with a guy for a few years in Arizona. (Let’s call him Bob.) We were in a tough spot when we moved in. During a date between him and my mom, my mom told him about how she’s been looking for a place to live (since she was running out of money and couldn’t continue to afford renting a house we’ve been staying in for a year). He offered for me and her to stay at his apartment.

Bob used to be nice. He told my mom, ""I know I'll be in a position of power, but I'll never abuse that."" He let her recover from a car accident she was in, while I finished high school. He was letting us live there for free. (My mom bought our own groceries, though.)

Eventually my mom started getting better and wasn’t bedridden all the time. That meant she wasn’t lying in Bob's room and being by his side 24/7. (He is very lazy.) He starts to get jealous when she’s talking on the phone, and tells her to come into his room if she’s out in the front room at night.

Fast forward and I get a job to start paying Bob to live there. I pay about $100 every 2-3 weeks for electricity (We’re in Arizona so we have SRP). Really cheap. However, my mom is unable to work because she’s still trying to recover, so she can’t pay anything. So what begins to happen is Bob saying we both owe him for allowing us to stay with him since he’s letting us live with him for free. So instead of needing to pay him more money (I was only working $11.70/hr 32 hrs/week), he proposed to my mom (My mom told me about it since it was between him and her) that she have sex with him as an alternative form of payment.

Fast forward and now it has become a rule, regardless if we pay him more money. If my mom doesn’t give him what he wants, when he wants, how he wants, he yells at my mom all night and doesn’t allow her to sleep. He does this everyday, every night. And he blames her for it and thinks he’s in the right. He even blames her if he decides to drink.

She’s tried working, but since he keeps her up all night she can’t go to work due to being extremely tired.

My mom has plenty of recordings of him saying that he’ll kick us out if he doesn’t have sex with her, but what can we do since she and I don’t have much money and nowhere to go? If he gets arrested, what does that mean for us? We’re not on the lease, so it’s not like we could continue living where we’re at. And we can’t go to a domestic abuse shelter because they’re not accepting any more applicants because of COVID-19.

I’ve been unemployed for a little over a month and am trying to get a job right now. I was social distancing since I was sick with what I’m very certain was COVID-19, but now I’m better and am trying to get a new job. But I just can’t take this anymore. I don’t know if law enforcement can make our situation better, considering what we have stacked against us.

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just woke up to my post receiving a lot of attention, so it'll take a while for me to get around to everyone. I forgot to mention that my mom and I have two dogs, a freezer chest, furniture, and food of ours we need to get out as well, which makes getting out a bit more complicated for us.Also, another tidbit of information for anyone suggesting that we go to a shelter: I'm a male.

481,481,"[Massachusetts] Neighbor's and their friends are trespassing on my property to get to lake via my private dock, what liability am I looking at?","I recently purchased a lakefront cabin with a private dock. The cabin is located at the end of a peninsula. This Sunday, I visited it and discovered about 10 people on the frozen lake and a giant pickup truck parked on my property.

As I was getting out of my car, the neighbor (whom I never met) walked passed me with her two dogs and a pizza and approached my dock. I saw a guy from the group of ten meet her on my dock and she gave him the pizza.

I told them they were on private property and that they were trespassing (even though there's signs saying so) and the guy seemed understanding, but the neighbor replied ""I've been doing this for 8 years.""

At which point, I replied, personally I didn't care, but what I didn't want was the liability of someone possibly getting hurt. They didn't reply and I left it at that. They did move the truck but I left so I don't know if they moved anything back or continued to use my dock.

What kind of liability and I looking at here? How should I best protect myself? Also, in Massachusetts, the Attorney General has decided not to prosecute some crimes, trespassing being one of them. I don't know what bearing, if any, this may have.

482,482,My old boss is hellbent on getting me fired from my new position,"**Cross post from r/relationships. They told me to come here for advice. It is a wall of text but I needed to make sure I had all the important information.**

Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

Edit: for u/commonWerewolf

Firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before I left that as soon as I was done with school I would be moving on fairly quickly. She was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

My last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. One of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. We also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before I would be done with school.

My 2 months were approved by HR and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. She said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as I HAD been reeling back my duties. The new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

My manager knew I hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that I really needed a break because in those 5 years I had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. Most of the time I was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok I was a grad student didn't really need one. I missed out on a lot of things because I was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

When I went on my vacation I was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that I could get a call that I could not turn down.

Also, when I did put in my 30 day notice, I did call and I talked with her. I told her I was more than willing to start my 30 days when I returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

I have done everything professionally and by the books. I always conducted myself in the most professional manner I could while improving patient care. We had replacements picked out a whole year before I left. The two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why I stayed so long.

And yes I said that to my friend because I genuinely didn't care at that point because I had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. So I wasn't so beat up about her being upset after I had the go ahead to leave.

I would love you to respond again because I do agree with what you have to say and any insight is perfectly valid and wanted!"
483,483,The courts granted a restraining order against my abuser and then accidentally sent my sealed address to him in the mail," I went to court earlier this year to get a restraining order against the man who stalked,  drugged, and raped me multiple times, when my husband was deployed. I bought my first house a year ago, meaning I can’t up and move easily. I specifically had the courthouse seal my address so that he wouldn’t find out where I live now. 
The court granted the restraining order due to the “severe mental and emotional pain he has caused me”, in the judges ruling. 
He filed an appeal which he lost. The appeal judge ruled that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence against him. So when they sent out the appeal memorandum letting me and my abuser know he lost.. they, by mistake, sent him my address... 
I need advice.. I can’t up and move, my husband is military and has to travel a lot.. I am disabled and scared. 
Is it possible to sue the court that gave him my address? If so, what kind of lawyer would I need to talk to?

485,485,Utility tree cutter threatened to come onto my property and “cut down all of those maples” [MA],"
Hi, folks! We received notice last week that the utility tree trimmers would be coming to our region to cut branches near the power lines. We are fine with that and have had that done before for some ill cedars, at our own expense, last year when we moved into our house (which we own). Yesterday, I heard them trimming trees and saw they had essentially cut down a tree on our property to a three foot stump. I went out to speak with the cutters and asked them to be more sensitive to the cutting and that they left me with a near dead tree I will have to pay to remove and stump grind. This tree, about seven feet tall, was more than 20 feet from any power line and was fully on my property. After him telling me he was just doing his job, I asked again for him to not do this to the other trees, he said, “If you don’t watch out I will go and cut down all of those maples” and pointed to a full grove of trees nowhere near a line and fully on our property. I told him that I found this to be a threat and asked him to not come onto our property. They eventually left and I filed a complaint with the power company. Their arborist is coming today to review the issue, and the manager from the tree trimming company is coming, as well.

I found this individual to be threatening, but does this constitute a crime or illegal activity? Can I forbid the tree company or this individual from coming onto my property if I felt threatened by his actions or words? And what about my poor sapling? It was a maple that I tended through the last year that was there when we bought the property. Thanks! And again, this is all in Massachusetts.

Update: Thank you all for your kind advice, and I greatly appreciate it. I wanted to update you on the meeting with the arborist and the manager from the tree trimming company. The three of us visited the tree (now a stump) in question, and I explained my perspective. The arborist attempted to defend the person who made the threat, but I pointed to the trees that the tree cutter had referenced, and he agreed they were not near power lines. He apologized for the incident, and I thanked him for his apology. He said that they were under contract with this tree trimmer for all services related to protecting powerlines from tree falls and branches.

I told both individuals that the threat made by the trimming company had made my family and I feel unsafe and then stated that because I did not know the individual who made the threat, that any employee of the tree trimming company (a very large company here in New England) would be tresspassing if they entered my property for any reason. The arborist said that the trees would need trimming, and I said that they were more than welcome to identify a different company and to meet with me before said trimming to discuss their plans. He verbally agreed to this. The tree company individual apologized for his employee's actions. I thanked them for meeting with me. I will need to file a formal complaint for stump grinding, and I will update once there is resolution. Thanks again, all."
486,486,Buyers back out of a home sale due to possible undiscovered mine under our neighborhood.,"You can’t make this shit up. This happened in Meade County, SD near Rapid City. We moved mid-April across the country for my job, and like anyone would do, we sold our house. Our neighborhood is nicely developed, and prices have jumped way up since we bought 5 years ago. We bought for $185K and sold (within 24 hours) for $249K. As you could imagine we were elated.

Fast forward to last week. My wife sees on the news that there was a sink hole down the road from our house. I didn't think much of it and thought that it may be inconvenient for the home owners affected, but thought the city would repair it and be on their way. That's when everything started to go to shit (like is the theme for this year).

We saw this [https://www.newscenter1.tv/two-sinkholes-in-black-hawk-led-to-discovery-of-a-potential-gypsum-mine-thursday/](https://www.newscenter1.tv/two-sinkholes-in-black-hawk-led-to-discovery-of-a-potential-gypsum-mine-thursday/) article. Apparently, there may have been an abandon gypsum mine underneath our neighborhood from the 1920s, 12 homes have been evacuated, our buyers have backed out of the purchase agreement 12 days before close, and we don't know if our home is now worthless.

They don't know a lot of details about the mine’s origin, if the company that owned it still exists, if the developer or the county even knew about it, or how many homes are really affected.

My questions are what are our options? If we can't sell it, who is at fault and how can we get compensated for what was seemingly a done deal? I know the buyers were legally allowed to back out and I'm not interested in pursuing that, but would the developer or county be legally required to compensate us for this? I'm obviously going to lawyer up, but i just wanted a baseline before starting 2 -way with a lawyer and starting to rack up fees. 

Thanks in advance.

TLDR: 2020 sucks ass!

Edit: Added location

Edit 2: Thanks for all the tips and advice. The neighborhood is meeting tonight to discuss possible legal action and a way forward."
487,487,Can my parents force a pregnancy test?,"My wife was sexually assaulted. She got pregnant, and the baby could be mine or the rapist's. We decided to keep the baby and raise it as mine. We never want to have a paternity test done on the baby because this could be devastating to her relationship with my wife.

I'm a massive moron, and after my daughter was born, I let slip to my parents that she might not be mine biologically. I tried to backtrack, but my parents kept pushing and pushing until my wife sat them down and explained the situation. They do not believe her. They think she cheated and that she is using me.

Now my parents have approached me about taking a paternity test. They want me to contest paternity and leave my wife. I do not want to. I made a commitment to my wife and daughter and I stand by it. I trust my wife, but my parents don't. They told me that if I refuse, they will go to court and compel me to do a paternity test to absolve me of responsibility for the baby. They want me to leave my wife regardless.

I am planning to cut contact with my parents over this, but is there any way that they can legitimately force me to do a paternity test? Is there something I can do to prevent this or fight them?

We are located in RI.

Edit: The title is supposed to say paternity, not pregnancy. I'm still a moron."

So, first, I didn't appreciate all of the nasty messages I got from people insulting me and berating me and saying that I was trying to ruin this family by calling CPS.  Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that some CPS workers have made poor decisions, but you're in idiot to not utilize it when it's appropriate. Along with those messages, I got quite a few from people saying they grew up in similar situations and had been indeed been molested and to please call and to put this in the hands of the authorities.  

I never personally thought that the girl was getting molested; I just wondered at what point this creepy emotional incest is deemed inappropriate. So I went ahead and called and when I said the woman's name, the worker said, ""Oh, she works at *****?"" So, she was already on the radar.  I told her what facts that I knew about that I thought were concerning.

Yesterday the coworker went on a rant about how she's being persecuted, that CPS is on her case again- again, after previous complaints about the child pooping repeatedly in the neighbor's yard when she was a toddler and something else about food stamp fraud getting her checked out by CPS a couple of years ago.  

There was a long convoluted conversation. I have to listen to this self-absorbed narcissist talk about herself endlessly and never say anything, just try to disengage as diplomatically as possible and get back to work.  But CPS wanted to see the girl's bedroom and they said she slept in the attic, which is a pull-down trap door. Which is never actually used and CPS was well aware of that. When the breast feeding topic came up, I was like Oh, she still breast feeds, huh? And get this, she said that at her age, she can no longer ""latch on"" and actually get milk out of the breast anyway. It's for bonding purposes. 

The bed thing......I thought it was super obvious before that they were having sex with her in the bed, which I personally find disgusting, but in the last post people seemed okey-dokey with it. So, I asked her, Isn't it hard to get any privacy for sex? You see, I'm not holistic and could not understand that it's a worldwide practice for parents to have sex in front of their children and it takes away their fear of death. Fucking gross. THREE HOURS LATER and she's still talking about all of this, well, more about how she's a martyr, and her mom brings the kid in after school. I turn to the kid and for the first time, got brave and said to the her, ""So what do you do at night when they're having sex?"" And she said, ""I pretend I'm sleeping!""  Both the grandma and mom were speechless, like maybe it dawned on them a little bit about how very bad that sounds.  

I'm not exactly sure how everything went down, but I do know that she's not being taken out of school, she was assessed and the professionals didn't think she was being molested (again, I didn't really think so but still thought this was inappropriate and not just a different form of parenting). They have to clean out one of the bedrooms that's a hoarding pit and provide her with her own bedroom. The girl's father was somehow in the loop and will be more active with her, since he's technically got half-time custody anyway. 

She said she's trying to have a second baby now anyway. And my favorite part, her sycophantic friends, even more poor than her, are doing fund raising on her behalf; for what or why, I do not know. 

For the people saying that they're going to figure out who I am here on Reddit, first of all, these people brag about not using social media, and second of all, they can kiss my ass; I'm leaving soon for nursing school WHERE I'M GOING TO VACCINATE ALL OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN!

490,490,"Dad had dog for 5 years, a girlfriend for 1. Girlfriend just stole his dog, what next?","Update: It’s been a wild few days! I joined all of the Richmond sell it groups and found our girl listed as lost dog found! My brother met them halfway between us and Richmond, and Gracie is home safe. Thank you all for the guidance and kind words!

And to answer the question on why she’s groomed every four weeks: I’m a certified canine esthetician using high end soap free products formulated specifically for the pH of the canine skin. Basically, Pugs shed- a LOT- and it’s crucial to get that dead coat out so her skin can function properly. It’s also recommended by just about every vet ever that nail trims should be performed every 2-4 weeks. If it compromised her skin, we would cut back on the grooming ;)

 My Dad’s girlfriend just skipped town with his dog and is headed back to her home state 600 miles away. We have a police report filed, we have her home address, 5 years of vet records pulled as well as all messages lining up my Dad getting this dog. She isn’t microchipped, I’m going to dig through her adoption paperwork today to see what else we’ve got claiming ownership. I’m also an animal groomer and have five years of her grooming photos saved, further proving ownership. What do we do next? What can we do? He’s heartbroken- we’re in Central MN and she drove with the dog back to Richmond, MO."

On Monday I went to court and got a restraining order against my mother for what happened. I've been in contact with many school offices removing my parents from my paperwork as well as getting support after everything that's happened. The school has been very helpful with giving me support as well as keeping me up to date with everything since there's an investigation happening. My mother is trying to sue whoever she can and has been sending people to message me. I haven't told the cops because technically there's no proof she's telling people to contact me but people back home are now trying to convince me to come back. I mentally have been happier only crying like once a week about everything. I have been getting all my documents she took and am working on getting the money she has of mine as well as getting an attorney to get my things back .
Thank you everyone who has responded to the previous post. It's been a hard confusing time for me but everything has helped."
492,492,Walmart refused to let me leave with groceries I paid for,"Yesterday afternoon I 34 f took my four year old son and two year old daughter grocery shopping at Walmart in Irvine, California. I was waiting on my next paycheck, so I bought $175 worth of groceries with $300 in the bank. The cashier kept asking me to swipe my card saying the transaction did not go through. I checked my bank balance with my Wells Fargo app and found that Walmart had already charged me the $175 for groceries. I asked for a manager to come and fix the situation. Manager assured me the charge would drop off. He asked for my bank card to call my bank. He said he wanted to look at the customer service phone number, so I told him the phone number. I also called my bank. They opened a claim and said they would email me the claim number, but I checked my inbox, and I did not receive an email from them. I asked the manager to try to contact his supervisor to see if the situation could be fixed so I could leave with my groceries as Walmart had already charged me for them and with the transaction pending, I did not have enough funds available to buy more groceries. Manager refused to contact his supervisor. He said, “he’s not here.” I ended up having to leave a full cart of groceries with this manager in tears and drive to Wells Fargo to explain the situation. They told me there was nothing they could do as long as the charge was pending. They said to call them as soon as the charge went through. I called Walmart customer service and explained the situation and emailed their corporate office. This morning, the charge went through. I called Wells Fargo and let them know, and they emailed me a claim number. I also emailed Walmart customer service again. As a single working mom of two young children, $175 is a lot of money to me. That was the grocery budget I had been able to set aside for the entire month for me and the kids. What can I do to make sure I get my grocery money back?"
493,493,My wife and I had an IVF baby but the baby looks very much Caucasian and we are both Pakistani and dark.,"The fertility clinic definitely messed up. My wife loves the baby way too much to say anything. Obviously the baby is going to grow up and ask questions. People near me ask if baby was adopted because baby is white and we are brown. I am going to get a DNA kit for my personal knowledge. But we are scared that we might lose custody if we say anything and we have become very attached to baby who is one years old now.

What should I do?

The egg and sperm was supposed to come from us. Did they mess up the embryo with wrong sperm or egg or did they insert the wrong embryo?

Just to clarify it’s not just skin colour, it’s also eye colour and hair colour"
494,494,[ UPDATE ] - Amazon Delivered My Expensive Product Without Honoring Signature Delivery And It Got Stolen,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/efdr56/amazon_delivered_my_expensive_product_without/)

( TEXAS )

I went straight to the police station once I could and was able to file a police report and made sure to get a copy of everything.

I proceeded to call Amazon this time rather than chat and make sure to explain everything to them in detail and also include the fact that I had filed a police report and was able to get them to refund my money.

I just want to thank everyone who commented especially those who advised me to file a police report and to call rather than chat with them ( I feel it really made a big difference ).

Thank you so much for all the advice and I wish you all a Happy New Year!"
495,495,my mom wants to terminate her parental rights because I don't want to have an abortion,"I'm 16 years old and live in Pennsylvania.

The people at the clinic wouldn't do the abortion after I said my mom was forcing me. They told my mom it has to be my decision.

My mom said she's going to the courthouse to give up her parental rights. Can she do this?

&#x200B;

Editing because some people are being really rude: I know what my options are. I know that she can kick me out when I turn 18. I know that I need a plan. I'm 16, not an idiot. I literally just want to know if she can terminate her parental rights immediately - there's a difference between having almost 2 years to plan for myself and my baby (which I'm not EVEN SURE I WANT TO HAVE YET I AM JUST STILL THINKING ABOUT MY CHOICES) and being kicked out onto the street immediately while pregnant."

497,497,"UPDATE - Condo board is telling me as of June 5th the parking spot i own, will be converted into a handicapped spot, but there are no other parking spots available. Is this legal?","My original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gt4ikx/condo_board_is_telling_me_as_of_june_5th_the/)

Thank you for all the advice, we ended up talking to a lawyer on Tuesday, and we paid him a small amount to write a nicely worded letter indicating that our Condo board had no right to do what they are doing.

The condo board has more or less agreed that they are in the wrong (yeah fuck them), and will be pursing other alternatives to create handicapped parking for this new owner.

Today the owner who wants the spot came to my door, telling me that i need to move my car because as of today it ""belonged"" to her. I explained to her what the condo board told me and she got very upset.

For now i am not going to move my car because i think she could be more of an issue then my condo board.

To answer a few questions:

* I did offer the condo board an option to buy my spot for a stupidly high price of $200,000 and a guaranteed spot when they increase the parking space. They are not interested.
* I do infact own this parking spot it is owned by me and deeded to me.
* There is no street parking/stopping in front of our building.
* Handicapped spots are actually owned/managed by the building.
* The issue came to heads when the people who bought the condo, had a verbal promise that there was available handicapped parking. However not long after making that promise another tenant needed a handicapped parking spot due to him being stuck in a wheelchair. So the spot ended up going to him.
* The actual owner who is complaining about this actually owns a non handicapped spot, however they refuse to trade it because they have two vehicles. Their other vehicle is one of those specialized minivans for wheelchairs.
* Finally the owner who has been making all of this fuss has been trying to take the condo board to court over this.

Anyways thank you legaladvice for your help!"
498,498,"My roommate tested positive for Coronavirus, then coughed in my face intentionally","My roommate informed me today that she tested positive for Coronavirus.  I decided we need to quarantine.  She then tried to invite her boyfriend over.  I requested he (as well as everyone else) don't come over as she's tested positive for Coronavirus.  We argued, and at the end she walked up and coughed in my face intentionally and said, there now we all have it, and let her boyfriend in.

I live in Salem, Oregon.  I feel like the intentional exposure to Coronavirus by my roommate is assault.  

Do I have legal grounds to press charges or go through civil court, for assault or otherwise, for my roommate coughing in my face while positive for Coronavirus?

Edit: So the advice I'm seeing is file a police report, but don't pursue any civil case (waste of time). I did call the police after this, and I verbally told them about the altercation- argument and her walking up to cough in my face and say 'there now we all have it(covid).'

Is filing a report different than telling the cop it happened? Or is there a report from me calling them?"
499,499,Boyfriend was taken off of life support and his family wants to pack up his things from our shared home.,"I'm currently pregnant and trying to figure out what my next steps are with this whole situation, we live in Arizona. My boyfriend had a drug overdose and was on life support. I knew that isn't what he would want and made that clear to his family. He has been taken off but now they are saying they need to get back home, they live in another state, so they want to come pack up his things. My problem with this is that he has been estranged from his family for years and has made it clear that he wouldn't want them to have anything. We shared a our living space and I don't want his family going through all of our stuff and taking what they want of his. My question is can I refuse to allow them into our home? I know they are next of kin and I have to give them his stuff but would I be able to just pack his stuff up and give it to them instead of then coming and going through everything?"
