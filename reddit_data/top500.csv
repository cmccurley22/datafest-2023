0,UPDATE - Kid put stuff in yard; ran over it with mower; mother wants me to pay.,"Thought I’d update you all since so many people offered advice in the original post yesterday.

Brief summary of what happened: Neighborhood kid left his phone in my grass while I was mowing and I mowed it by mistake. The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.

Well she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I’d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn’t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn’t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that’s how she keeps track of him.

I told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I’d give him the phone.

He instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he’d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.

Left and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)

I had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.

I had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won’t always work out like this.

I also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I’ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) 

He again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he’d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I’d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.

I hope I’ve done the right thing and didn’t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn’t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.

Thanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it."
1,"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it’s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I’m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she’s going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we’ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I’d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren’t for you guys I would’ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

2,"(Update) Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything."
3,"[UPDATE] Neighbors entrusted me with looking after their pets/house for 3 weeks, it has been almost a year now and they haven't come back. Today their basement flooded, and i have no idea what to do.","My original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ggtnwp/neighbors\_entrusted\_me\_with\_looking\_after\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ggtnwp/neighbors_entrusted_me_with_looking_after_their/) 

Good news, i followed everyone's advice reached out to the police and the embassy. Explained the situation, and gave them a bunch of information. 

Tonight i got a phone call from them, explaining they just decided to stay much much longer and spend time with family/friends. They apparently asked his wife's brother to come and collect the animals and get the key a long time ago back in August, but never followed up on it.

He apologized and said he was sorry, he gave me two options, and asked if i wanted to keep his pets since i have had them for so long, or he will push his step brother to get the animals. Apparently the animals don't really mean anything to him or his wife which i feel is quite shitty.

He apparently can no longer access his email, and passed me along a new email address/phone number i can use to contact him. But told me he doesn't have plans to return to Canada anytime soon.  I mentioned the water damage, and he just said they can buy a new house or get it fixed when they get back. 

He was also quite confused and somewhat annoyed, about the lengths we went to get in touch with him. He didn't understand why we reached out the embassy. He then offered to send me a bunch of money to square away the inconvenience, and that was more or less it.

I don't know if it is a cultural thing, however i feel kind of pissed off at how little he/his wife seem to care about the pets/his house. 

Anyways me and my wife are going to keep the pets simply because well i don't think ether of us can part with the dogs and his cat at this point."

5,I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor.,"This is in north Texas. 

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to “Check on me” and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

6,Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20’s, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven’t consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli’s Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter’s car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like “The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby.” As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone’s screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I’m calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn’t get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their “duty” to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. "
7,"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!"
8,"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.","I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.

I hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me."
9,"An update on ""My ex has a restraining order against me and now lives in the same apartment complex""","The public defender that represented me was no longer practicing in the NYC area but I retained a lawyer who was a friend of a friend who had experience in this area.

My lawyer got references from my PO, Employer, and AA Sponsor.

Our goal was to get the restraining order modified to a simple no-contact order with no distance requirements so I could continue living with my partner. I spoke to the Judge told him my story, what I had done to correct my past transgressions.  He reviewed my record. We submitted our references.

During this time period I was crashing on a friends couch as to not vioalte my propective order.

&#x200B;

* PO said I had paid my fines, followed all the rules, and never once had to remind me of my restrictions, and so forth and said he was impressed with my turnaround.
* My employer said that I was always early, never seemed to be under the influence or hangover from anything, and even at our company functions was very open and honest about my sobriety and didn't partake in drinking
* My AA Sponsor said good things about me too, how he was impressed with my maturity, and openness on my alcoholism and addiction.

Then the Judge asked my ex-wife to speak. My ex-wife said she was shocked by my turnaround. She said that it seemed unfair to her to require me to move because she moved into my building unknowingly and that she no longer felt threatened by me. This was a shock to both my lawyer and I as I expected my Ex to want to keep the protective order in place.

The Judge said that he wouldn't modify the protective order but lift it entirely as he felt it had served its purpose and that based upon my references, my testimony, and most importantly the testimony of my Ex that he didn't see how keeping it place was benefiting anymore.

He did tell my Ex that if she ever felt threatened or in danger because of something I said or did she could contact the police. The Judge then told me his main reason for lifting the order was to allow me to live in my current apartment but advised it was a good idea to avoid contact with my Ex to avoid any potential complications down the road. He reminded me because of my past it wouldn't take much to get another procetive order put in place. I told the Judge I had no intention of talking/contacting to my Ex and I was thrilled that I don't have to move and get to stay with my current girlfriend. 

So over the course of this weekend I moved back into my apartment with my girlfriend. I'm glad this was resolved."
10,Cop keeps pulling me (22f) over just to mess with me,"Hi, I made this account today because I’m really upset right now and I need to know if I have any grounds to get this man to experience any type of disciplinary action.

I live in a small town in Wisconsin so the cops kind of know everybody. But there’s this one cop who keeps pulling me over for the most craziest and asinine reasons like I was too close to the curb or I stopped too close to the stop sign. He’s a young attractive cop and I’m young and attractive as well so I’m thinking he’s trying to flirt with me or something? But the situations are so aggravating and the things he says and does seem like he’s intentionally trying to antagonize me so that I’ll say or do something out of anger and he’ll have an excuse to escalate the situation.

But today he crossed the line. He pulled me over again under the guise that I wasn’t going the speed limit (it was 45 I was going 50) and when he came to my car and said his usual bullshit in the most condescending way he said he had to search ME, not the car, because my car smelled funny. My car smells like vanilla and I’ve never smoked anything in there so I know he was bullshitting me again. I told him that if he wants to search me he’ll have to get a female officer to do it, but he said if I don’t comply he’ll arrest me. So I got out of the car, he told me to put my hands on my car so I did, and he just starts rubbing me up and down. Not even searching for anything, just rubbing me! He went over my thighs twice, my lower back, and almost cupped my boobs. I was wearing a skin tight skirt set, no pockets and you could clearly see that I had nothing on me.

I’m typing this like 30 min after it happened, I’m upset and angry and I feel violated. Is there any way I can get him in trouble for this?

I have a GoPro in my car but idk if it caught this on camera I didn’t check yet."

Thanks to everyone’s terrific advice, I got my university’s ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school’s general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration’s decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors’ incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I’ll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward. 

Thank you everyone here who took time to give me such helpful advice. I appreciate all of you! "
12,"UPDATE: My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... I GOT CUSTODY!!!","**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me."
13,My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I’m growing very worried,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We’ve been married for 3 years now. She’s always been one for quirky, “against-the-grain” thinking and interests. However, it’s not just harmless things like believing there’s no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in “aesthetic poses”, or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there’s this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she’s worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She’s refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she’s coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we’ve had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

“Oh well if you look this graph you’ll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>”

“I’m the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I’m right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc...” 

I’ve tried explaining to her the basic idea of “correlation doesn’t equal causation.” By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with “We aren’t talking about ice cream and murder, we’re talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They’re completely different!”

I’ve tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn’t as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with “Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and “big-pharma”

She won’t budge and hasn’t budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I’m worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could’ve been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife’s knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don’t want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED"

So to make a long story short, i called our local Audubon society. They didn't think feeding the crows was bad and suggested that the neighbors also start feeding them so they essentially became better socialized.

The plan worked and the crows are now a beloved part of the community. There have been no recent dive bombings.

Most amazingly, the crows may have legitimately saved my neighbor. Our city had a pretty big ice and snow event recently. Like i said in my last post, most of my neighbors are older. One of my neighbors was walking down his steep driveway, slipped, and couldnt get back up.

The crows started going *ballistic* and were making more noise than we have ever heard. A different neighbor went outside to see what was up and found the gentleman in his driveway. Neighbor is mostly ok! Just some serious bruises. 

Needless to say the crows have been getting some high value food since then.

Thanks for all the help on my original post. It blew up way more than i was expecting and i thought you guys would enjoy an update."
15,"Regular customer tipped me scratch tickets for years. I finally won something, and they are threatening legal action because I don't want to give them a cut. [FL]","Florida.

I worked as head bartender for a local restaurant for a number of years, and there was a regular customer who was there very frequently. I interacted with this customer frequently: they tipped *exclusively* in scratch tickets and specifically called to ask for my schedule, asked me out on multiple occasions, et cetera. Probably about forty years my senior. If you've ever watched The Good Place, this guy was IRL Brent.

I won something from the scratch ticket that wasn't five/ten dollars: the final amount after taxes was about three months salary for me, and I was making good money. I specifically didn't tell the customer not because I thought they would want it but because I didn't want them feeling like I owed them something or that I should be thankful towards them. I did tell a coworker, and it got to him through the grapevine.

The next time I came in, he congratulated me and asked how we wanted to split it. I sternly told him that it was my tip and long story short he went to my manager, who took his side. I quit (had been planning to anyway since I'm about to finish school).

My manager GAVE THIS GUY MY EMAIL (I'm curious on the legality of this too) and he (customer) emailed me saying that if I didn't agree to give him 50% he'd take legal action.

Do I need to worry about taking his threat seriously? Is there anything I can or should do to protect myself? I'm assuming this is a bluff but I want to have my bases covered.

TL;DR: Me drink lady. Mean man who buy many drinks gives me scratchy scratchy papers instead of green paper for many days. One day scratchy scratchy says me get a lot of green paper, but man no like this when he hear because he want some of green paper too. Me say no, green mine, so he say that he take swift and immediate legal action if me no comply. Me no need comply, right?"
16,Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. "
17,"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told ""good luck"". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car."
18,"Deadbeat dad ditched my mom when she was pregnant with me 50 years ago (they were married). No child support, no nothing. Now he’s dead and left a 1M+ estate to a charitable trust. In the trust he stated he had no children. Do I have any recourse? State is California.",
19,Subaru Service center gave my car to someone else,"FINAL UPDATE

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. 

<EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!

20,"Update, my son took the Boba Fett figure.","So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200B;

So, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200B;

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end."
21,My Daughter Disowned my Underage Grandson. What do I do?,"I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


My sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. 


I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

22,[CO] My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. She now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. I want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.,"Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200B;

We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200B;

Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you."
23,Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. "
24,[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!"
25,Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped. 


 "
26,[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. "
27,Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. "

29,Can I get a paternity test on myself?,"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad. I casually asked my mom to see my birth certificate the next day and she got mad again and wouldn't let me see it. 

TLDR I think my dead sister is my real mom. In Florida btw."
30,"[FL] My parents have joined some new age ""religion"" and intend to move me to a compound against my will. What can I do to get the hell out of here?","So I really don't know how to start this so i'll get right too it.

&#x200B;

My mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are. When I'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. Because of this I have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

&#x200B;

This Monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. They told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200B;

I need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200B;

I'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him. My 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. My sisters dad is going to call cps too and I just got done with my call to them but I wont repeat what they said here. I will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to Florida immediately if I don't check in with him or he hears I went back to her. He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. They both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). I also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. My dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. Thanks guys for the advice."
31,I exposed my chest at work as proof I had breast cancer after boss and coworker were spreading rumors that I didn’t actually have cancer. Arkansas,"I had breast cancer about a year and a half ago. I got surgery and took FMLA. Luckily I didn’t have to undergo chemo or radiation. Surgery was able to remove all my tumors. I still have check ups and screenings occasionally and have to miss work. Another coworker in another department has breast cancer but unfortunately was unable to hand it removed by only surgery and had to be out longer. She is still undergoing treatment. 

I declined reconstruction on my breasts so I was able to come back to work at 3 1/2 weeks. My FMLA is intermittent. I do take it occasionally for those check ups and screenings because I am at high risk of it returning. 

I have no breast on my left side (just a flat scar - no breast tissue) and I have no nipple and only a smaller amount of breast tissue on my right side (they removed a lot of breast tissue with a lumpectomy but were able to salvage about 55% of the breast tissue). I have no nipples. 

I did something very dumb because I am a very dumb person. 

My coworkers and my immediate supervisor have been talking about my breast cancer for weeks because I had to miss an important meeting for a breast MRI and a bone scan. I requested off. Got my manager and HR to approve it. Converted under my FMLA signed by my oncologist. 

They have been spreading rumors that because I came back to work so soon that I didn’t have breast cancer. I wear a prosthetic at work so no one sees me flat. They are saying everyone they know with any cancer always has to take a lot of time off work and I seem fine. 

They (coworkers and supervisor , not my manager or HR) are saying I am abusing FMLA. 

Someone said they saw me out at the store (after an oncology appointment that was approved by my manager I did stop by the grocery store on my way home) and I looked fine. Again I am not on chemo so my appointments are check ups and blood draws. I feel fine after. They are emotionally draining but physical I feel great. 

It got to the point where I was scared to even take appointments because I knew coming back to work would be the worst. Again, my manager has always been supportive and HR too. This is just my supervisor and my coworkers. 

I have a surgery coming up to help with some scarring. They are just going to clean up some of the tissue now that everything has healed and I have been cancer free for over a year. I let my supervisor know they are thinking about scheduling it for the summer and he said “right the cancer thing again”. 

One particular day last week, I got upset because I heard them in the office next door talking about me. They were saying I was scamming everyone and that I didn’t deserve the upcoming raises. About how I didn’t have cancer. I got upset and I walked over and I lifted my shirt and prosthetic bra and showed them the scars on my chest. I did cover my remaining 55% there breast with no nipple with my hand but my scars were on display for all to see. 

I then told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my desk. This was on Friday at 3:30 pm. I left at 4:30 like I always do. No one has said anything. It is now Monday and I am worried. I had time to think over the weekend and realized it was a huge mistake. I should have just gone to HR about the gossip. 

I have seen my manager but they haven’t said anything. My supervisor hasn’t said anything. None of my gossiping coworkers have said anything. The ones that don’t gossip haven’t said anything and are acting like normal. 

What should I do to un-mess this up? What can I expect them to do to me legally? Could the coworkers I exposed my chest to call the police? My husband said they likely could but probably wouldn’t. Do I get a lawyer now and ask his advice? Would I hurt myself more by going to my manager and HR and saying “ I messed up”? I am so worried and confused. Any legal advice would be appreciate. I image if they did fire me something like this would keep me from unemployment right? I know they can legally fire me for any non protected reason and this isn’t protected."

34,"GF's dad filled out her mail-in ballot, forged her signature, and sent her a photo of the completed ballot with the caption 'If anybody asks, you voted.'","My girlfriend was furious. Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. 

I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.

Edit: This is in Arizona.

Edit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him ""throw it out"" and risk it being submitted. The reason the ballot did not come to us is because he signed her up for early voting and put his address as the place to mail it. We live in a different city. "
35,[Texas] I [23F] had sex with a 17-year-old. He told me he was 19. He took a video of us having sex without my consent and is threatening to share it. What can I do?," We met on Tinder in December and started seeing each other in January. We've slept together a handful of times. I decided it would be best to stop seeing each other around the start of last month when they started telling people to stay away from each other.

At first he was really understanding but over the past couple weeks he's been pushing to see me more. I kept trying to make plans to see him once everything has calmed down but he's been insisting on coming over to my place despite everything. Yesterday I finally put my foot down and let him know we wouldn't be meeting now or later since I didn't like how pushy he was being.

He called me and we got into it because I wouldn't let him come over. Once we hung up, he snapped me a video of us HAVING SEX in his fucking car. I don't even know when he took it. It's dark so you can't really see me but it's clearly my voice. On the video he wrote that I would either let him come over or he'd send the video to my boss and tell his mom because HE'S 17. I told him I was out of town because my sister had her baby (which is true) but he could come over when I got back. I was afraid if I told him no straight up that he'd send the video.

I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS 17. I NEVER would have slept with him. I have screenshots of his Tinder profile where his age is clearly listed as 19. I don't have a Facebook so we were never friends on there but I do have his Insta and SC and nothing on those indicates he's 17. I keep thinking back over all of our interactions but even in text messages he doesn't say anything to indicate he was in high school.  He told me he went to a local community college, he talks about college classes and getting off of his job at HEB. Anyway it's not like we had long conversations; our relationship consisted of having sex and maybe getting dinner beforehand.

Please help me. I've been freaking out about this for several hours. I work with kids right now and I'm in school to be a school social worker, I can't have this on my record. I know I should probably go to the cops but how can I do that and make sure nothing comes out of this???"
36,[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they “want nothing more than a person with my background on their team.” He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn’t necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Edit: I'm going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I'm taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that Adderall does when wearing off.

37,Ex-wife is suing me for child support. I don't even have a penis... (update),"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I have both good news and bad news.

The good news is that I won the battle with my ex. I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

The bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. 

Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. "
38,(Update) My bank put my account under another account and refused to fix it or refund the money,"Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d5p1oh/my_bank_put_my_account_under_another_account_and/

I submitted an OCC complaint against my bank the same day I posted, about 2 weeks later the bank called me and asked me what day works for me and I would be meeting their National Enterprise Financial Crimes Director himself at my local branch or if I did not want to come in they would come to my house even after business hours.

The next week I go in and meet him, he does nothing but apologizes for about 20 minutes and tells me they will immediately cut me a check and or give me cash for the missing funds that were transferred to the ""mistakenly approved parent account"". I quote that phrase because he said it exactly like that about 20 times.

I tell him great, I'll take cash since I have already opened a new account elsewhere and do not intend to continue to use their services since it took me reporting them to a government agency before they did anything at all to fix the situation that was clearly their fault. 

He tells me that's fine and he understands but he just needs me to sign a ""small document"" saying the situation has been remedied to my satisfaction, the ""small document"" is about 20 pages of stuff that I understand about half of but I can kind of see it's basically me saying that I am being refunded the money and I can take no legal action against them, can not talk about it and cannot tell anyone their mistake. Also that I must remove all ""public postings, mentions, anything negative about the bank from any online reviews or websites publically accessible"". Seems they found my reddit post.

He tells me that I cannot receive my money unless I sign this. I tell him definitely not since I cannot understand half of this and I leave without my money. So I once again file another OCC complaint online and call in to speak to someone. They tell me this is being escalated and to wait to hear from them, about a week later the bank is once again calling me for a meeting. I tell them I want nothing except a check mailed to my address on record and to leave me alone otherwise.

After a few calls a check finally showed up, for the full amount that was transferred to the parent account. Thanks LA for telling me about the OCC (The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). They take complaints seriously and it's what it took to finally get this whole thing resolved."
39,"(AZ) Our neighbors dog was poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). Wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. I say absolutely not. How should we proceed?","I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

So they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

So we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. 

We had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" I was really taken aback and I think I asked ""I think so, do you need some?"" 

He then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


The officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) ""not yet."" 
I asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

I just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

She thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

Thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not.

>Edit: hey guys I’m involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I’m sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don’t want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

41,"Cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing","I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I’m obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there’s any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there’s so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would’ve payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you.

I am now back in the US. It wasn't easy and took a long time mostly because my parents had hid all my American documents from me. But I found them, took originals and replaced them with copies. They never noticed.

The office of foreign interests at the Swiss embassy were very helpful although they didn't do anything until I had the documents proving that I'm a US citizen. I was able to exit Iran by going on a vacation with my family to Turkey and I just did not come back with them. The foreign interests office arranged everything so that I could go to the US consulate in Istanbul, they were already in the loop and were aware of my case, I had a quick interview and picked up my travel documents. My brother bought a ticket for me to fly to the US directly from Istanbul. I had a difficult time getting through airport immigration and had to answer questions for over an hour but in the end everything was fine.

Needless to say my parents are very upset with me but they have no control over me anymore. I now need to find a job and see what I can do for going to college. Thank you for the advice."
43,"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate."
44,Found cash in my walls. It's mine right? Can I deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (Washington). Update: It is deposited and my student loans are paid back!,"[My question](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72wjbw/found_cash_in_my_walls_its_mine_right_can_i/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

45,Shot my stalker in the chest 5 years ago in self defense. He immediately started harassing me again a few days after being released from parole supervision.,"Throwaway because the stalker comments on pretty much every post I make on my main account. I even got flagged for karma manipulation for having a ""friend"" comment on my post. He's not my friend.

Anyway, 5 years ago I was stalked for six months by a guy I knew less than a month as an actual person. We dated very briefly, I broke things off and things seemed amicable until he started showing up outside my house and demanding I be with him or else. 


He had decided that he was a good man and he deserved a chance. He threatened that if he didn't get a chance, he'd kill me or hopefully Id kill myself.

After 6 months of daily threats, 10+ police reports, multiple restraining order attempts, moving, getting rid of all social media, he found me and kicked my door in at midnight. I ended up shooting him, after a lot of games on his part(refusing to come to court, self imposed starvation) he was finally sentenced and went to jail for 5 years.

I guess he was on parole for about 4 months after his release because I immediately started receiving messages and comments from him, he just picked right back up where he left off. I contacted the parole board and they said he was released from supervision a few days before.

I have contacted the police, was approved for a restraining order but of course they haven’t been able to serve it. 


They said they can’t prove the messages are from him despite him using his name, posting his pictures and literally commenting my name and talking about the shooting in comment replies. The detective is waiting for a subpoena from reddit to prove it’s him. I am documenting every bit of harassment of course..but I am just...exhausted.

I am so incredibly frustrated with the lack of help available and closed doors there are for people being stalked.

Is there anything else I can do in the mean time?"
46,"(MD) Lady is convinced she owns our house-- she tried to evict us, and is now sending her mail here to falsify proof of residence. Help please?","Background:

My husband and I bought a house in 2016 from a bank, as it had foreclosed upon the previous owner. About a year after we moved in, the previous owner showed up at our front door and tried to push past my sister to get into the house, saying she owned it. She left after threatening to call the police, but showed up 4-5 more times over the next 1.5 years, doing the same thing. She brought the police herself once, and they told her to leave once we showed him our contracts from closing on the house. He said that if she came back it would be considered trespassing, and included in his paperwork that she wasn't welcome on the property-- fortunately she hasn't been back since then. We invested in a Ring doorbell and security cameras near each door after the first two visits.

&#x200B;

After that she brought us to housing court in 2018 to try to evict us (from the house we own) but did not show up because she put our address down as her own in the paperwork, therefore never received the notice to appear since her copy was mailed to us. Fortunately we have title insurance and they send a lawyer to represent us for free, and the judge dismissed the case with prejudice. About a year later, she did the exact same thing but showed up to court saying she has a certified deed to the house so she owns it. The same lawyer represented this time, and the judge dismissed it again.

&#x200B;

The mail part:

A bit over a year ago we began receiving her monthly phone bill in the mail (she didn't just forget to change the address after she moved, there was a 2-3 year gap with no mail in her name) so my husband brought a few of them, unopened, to the post office, explained what had been going on, and they said they'd take care of it. Then in summer 2019, the key to our mailbox no longer worked-- it turned out she brought her deed to the post office, said she lost her key, and asked them to change the lock and give her a new key. Fortunately when my husband realized the key didn't work, he went to the post office and was able to intercept before they gave her the new key, so I don't believe she actually gained access to the mailbox.

During this time, the cell phone bills never stopped, and we've been receiving more mail in her name (from a radiology office, the Motor Vehicles Association, and other random non-spam items). I worry she's trying to do the same thing again-- have mail sent to our address, steal it somehow, and attempt to use it to prove residency.

My husband said when he told the post office manager what had been happening, they would report it, but we haven't heard anything at all-- and as I mentioned, the mail in her name has increased since then. I tried calling the Post Inspector's hotline, but it went to voicemail and I've never gotten a response from any voicemail I left to them.

I'm just kind of at a loss of what my next move should be? I just want this mess to be over."
47,[Update] [Iowa] City threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors,"This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

Hello r/legaladvice,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. 

So I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

Skipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

Once I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.

Of course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

A few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

This was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

I spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.
2. They must pay legal damages to me.
3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.
4. They must write an apology letter to me.
5. My favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.

All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. I'm super grateful to the ACLU for helping me with this, because as I said above, I wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. I'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the ACLU -- thank you for all of the help!"
48,[Update] My landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave,"Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cg42cd/my_landlord_shut_off_the_electricity_in_the/

This happened in NY.

I'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. It was very helpful.

After the post my SO and I decided to get a hotel. When we came back this morning the power was back on. My neighbor told me what happened:

Shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). The firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. Long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

The poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. I'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease."
49,[UPDATE] The 17-year-old is actually 19.,"[This is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fvxeql/texas_i_23f_had_sex_with_a_17yearold_he_told_me/)

Long story short, following everyone's advice I reached out to an attorney who advised me to begin compiling records of my communication with him and to record any communication we had going forward. She told me to avoid reaching out to him but to be prepared if he reached out to me. I downloaded a call recording app and started backing up my screenshots of our texts and messages. He did unmatch me on Tinder so thank you to everyone that warned me our conversations would go away.

He didn't say so, but I think he may have seen my Reddit post. I only say that because I know it made the front page and last night he called out of the blue to apologize and ask me to not call the police. So, either he saw it or he had a come to Jesus moment. He told me that he is 19 and that he only said he was 17 to scare me since I was being a bitch and wouldn't let him come over. When I told him to prove his age or I'd call the cops, he texted me a picture of his ID. He also says that it isn't me on the video but that he deleted it anyway. I'm not sure if this is the truth but I've got a recorded confession so that's something. 

I haven't spoken to the attorney since he called me but I did email her with a transcript and recording of our conversation. We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. I'm still going to be seeking legal action, I'm just not sure what action since his ID does say he's 19. In that case there was no CP although I know there's still a case for sextortion. I don't think it would be wise for me continue updating this situation on Reddit if he's here too so this will probably be the last thing I say about it. 

Thanks to everyone that has messaged me to be supportive, I really appreciate it. I can't respond to everyone because between PMs and chats, I'm sitting on 300+ messages about that post. Funnily enough, a nice chunk of them are from men calling me a pedophile, saying they hope I get raped since I'm such a slut, trying to figure out where in Texas I am so we can hook up, etc. This man tried to coerce me into having sex with him via blackmail and I'm the one getting blamed because I had sex with someone I believed was an adult. 

From this point on, I'll only be seeing men my age or older, and IDing everyone. According to the attorney, the fact that he looked old enough wasn't an excuse. This might sound dramatic but for most of yesterday, I really thought my life was over. Never again."

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though.

I went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. She took one look at the letter from my friend Aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

She contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me Aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if I heard more otherwise no need for more action.

Aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. He wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. I hadn't complained to them myself so I did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

Thanks for the advice in the previous thread, especially /u/Wittyandpithy's excellent not-practicing-legal-advice to actually pay to use a legal professional.

52,Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones."
53,Doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results.

My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. 

I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!""

Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?

54,Mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that I said I don’t want to pay,"So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.

Anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

This isn’t legal right?

*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

Turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He’s stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she’ll give me the rest back and that she’s still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I’m at a loss what to do next.

*Update 3: Doesn’t sound like I’m getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

I’m still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can’t touch it. Just in case they get any ideas."
55,[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

For reference, I am 19 years old and I live in Colorado"
56,Daughter threatened with expulsion over t-shirt,"Due to the huge amount of PMs and chats that I've received and the fact that people in our district are identifying us by this post, I have removed the story to avoid being doxxed. We have no desire to go public and we do not want this story of sexual harassment to be attached to our daughter forever. Please leave us alone.

And to the person who messaged me and told me I should have never had children and that I'm taking feminism back a step, please reconsider your feeling of entitlement over my daughter's body, time, and life. Going public would have lasting ramifications for her social life and self esteem, particularly if subjected to internet trolls and the like. She is not obligated to dedicate the entirety of her emotional energy to an internet phenomenon. We are handling this without the media."
57,"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. 

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

58,UPDATE: A guy drove off with my couch while I was moving in because “If it’s on the street corner it’s public property”,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/axq0tu/a_guy_drove_off_with_my_couch_while_i_was_moving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Thank you to the user who suggested I look in the Facebook marketplace. I found it in there and got the name of the man who took it. 

I took that information to the police and the man had other complaints of petty theft against  him. 

Even better, one of the people who helped me move realized my neighbor has a video doorbell and I was able to get proof to the cops that the man stole my couch with me standing right there with a moving truck and boxes. 

A friendly officer went to his house and got my couch back, as well as a few other stolen outdoor furniture pieces (one was a bench from a local restaurant, I don’t know the other situations.) 

I deeply appreciate your legal advice, I now won’t have to tell my parents the beloved multi-generational couch is gone. Cheers"
59,(update) My autistic brother was banned from the local hobby shop.,"[So i came here yesterday to ask for some advice on my situation and I thought I might as well leave a update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9l2z39/co_my_autistic_brother_was_banned_from_the_local/)

&#x200B;

So I want to start out by saying that I was wrong and I want to apologize to anyone I may have hurt with my last question. It was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and I wish I could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. Me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200B;

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. This has been a learning experience for me and I hope that I can become a better person because of it."

Hey guys. I first just want to thank you all for all the support regarding my last post.

I’ve had a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer and have filed a police report like many of you suggested. I let my cousin and aunt and uncle know this and they immediately ended up offering to pay my hospital bill (and ambulance ride) in full.

My cousin gave me a half-hearted apology and his parents told me he won’t be leaving the house for the next year and will be severely punished for this.

I’ve decided not to press charges, I don’t really have the money/time for it, and all I needed was my medical expenses paid. I just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long LONG time.

Thanks again for all the love and support.

61,A former Air BnB guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (Texas),"Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

Edit:  Well that was quick~!  The Post Office called me directly before I could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  They're very certain what she did is illegal.  Thanks /u/BeamDriver for the advice!  Important lesson here kids:  Don't fuck with people's mail, because the USPS apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.  

Edit 2:  OMG this made it to the front page?  Not what I expected from a post that was solved on the first comment.  Thanks for your updoots everyone!  "
62,Can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?,.
63,[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Thank you all. "
64,Update. My parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.,"Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation I thought I would give you guys a update on everything. It's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i'm settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200B;

So after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200B;

My mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200B;

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don't feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start. Thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. I really do appreciate it :)"
65,"Husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. How can I find an attorney with no money?","Tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. This is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. What is a surprise is it's suddenness.

I've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what I made on day-care.

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"". I would say I was shocked, but I really am not. He's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? I understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. I don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

I'm in Wisconsin, I've tried to Google up the best could since the little one went to sleep but I can't find what I'm looking for or even really know what I'm looking for. Thanks for anyone who helps"

Thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

A long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

I am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. "
67,[oregon] I accidentally created an army of crow body guards. Am I liable if my murder attempts murder?,"To make a long story short, im a late 20 something living in portland oregon. I had a pretty intense emo/goth phase as a tween that i thought i had grown out of. 

A couple months ago, i was watching a nature program on our local station about crows. The program mentioned that if you feed and befriend them, crows will bring you small gifts. My emo phase came back full force and i figured that i was furloughed and had lots of time- so why not make some crow friends. 

My plan worked a little too well and the resident 5 crows in my neighborhood have turned into an army 15 strong. At first my neighbors didnt mind and enjoyed it. They're mostly elderly and most were in a bird watching club anyway. They thought the fact that i had crows following me around whenever i go outside was funny. 

Lately, the crows have started defending me. My neighbor came over for a socially distanced chat (me on my porch her in my yard) and the crows started dive bombing her. They would not stop until she left my yard. 

They didnt make physical contact with her, but they got very close.

Am i liable if these crows injure someone since i fed them? I obviously cant control the crows. I would rather them not attack my neighbors. But since i technically created this nuisance, could i be financially on the hook for any injuries?

To be clear, they're not agressive 100% of the time. If just the neighbors are out they are friendly normal crows. They only get aggressive when someone gets close to me or my property.

ETA: TL;DR- I have turned into Moira Rose, queen of the crows. My inadvertent crow army has gotten aggressive towards others. If they hurt someone could i be held liable?

ETA PT II: I did not train these birds to attack. Also thank you for all of your awards. Im glad my stupid decisions bring you joy. Please consider donating that money to your local Audubon society instead"
68,Dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. How do I protect myself legally?,"I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

The last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

They leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. 

They drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

They regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.

They have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

They like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. 

I have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. 

I recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

Since then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

The woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

I understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

I just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

She had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

They have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. 

I have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

I can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. 

They are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

If I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. 

All it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. 

I want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?"
69,Boyfriend and I slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. Landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out,"This happened in Ontario, Canada.

So this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

I found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

For more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

All we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

Boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

I dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. 

EDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

70,Caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result,"I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. 
There is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

I know I'm angry and grieving. But because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until I had to let her go. 

Is there anything I can do?"
71,"Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.","This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. 

We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

Once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""Do not worry! This won't happen again"". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.""

We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.

We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated."
72,[UPDATE] Fired from my job for salary discussion in NC,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f5tda9/got_fired_for_discussing_salary_at_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 

I posted back in February that I was fired from my job for discussing wages. This subreddit told me to file a charge with NLRB. They found merit in my case and I just got a settlement. Please please please even if you live in an at will state do the tough work of charging the company. You deserve to advocate for yourself."
73,"(MA) after giving me written permission to make a permanent decision, my ex changed her mind and has now decided to sue me for emotional damages. Advice needed--thinking of settling.","I will probably consult with a lawyer in the near future. I understand that the title is vague but I was trying to keep triggering topics out of the title. I'm using mobile so there may be some formatting issues. 

I have a daughter (13) with an ex who was not in her life. We were young, in our early 20s, when she was born. My ex wasn't ready to give up her life and be a mom yet so I assumed full custody. She had another child when our daughter was 9 and never spoke to our daughter again or really acknowledged her. I remarried as well and my wife has been an amazing stepmom to my daughter. 

My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. I made sure to let my ex know of course and sent periodic updates. She didn't visit or call and basically things went on as normal. 

In December 2019 it became apparent that her fight was drawing to a close and there was nothing anyone could do. I sent the following email (copy pasted text because I'm technologically illiterate, with private info removed): 

""Jess, 
I want to let you know that we got the results of E's scan today. The cancer has spread significantly with several new growths and no change to the old sites. 

At this time doctors are advising that treatment is unlikely to be successful and we would be better off providing her with comfort care instead. She will be a lot more comfortable and be allowed to go home which she really wants. 

L, the doctors, and I have all talked to her as well as child life. She has agreed that it's time to come home. She is being discharged tomorrow to hospice at home. 

As always, she would love to see/hear from you.""


she replied to that email a short time later with ""thank you for the update"". She didn't call or reach out to our daughter at all. 

After coming home from the hospital, my daughter asked me to mail a letter and to send an email she'd written to her mother. I don't know what the letter or email said but I know that neither one was replied to. 

In January, our daughter passed away. I sent the following emails:

""Jess, 
I wish I didn't have to write this email. Our sweet E passed away in her sleep. It was very peaceful. I will send another email with funeral details. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."" 

and then the one about the funeral. I had to redact most of that one because it was full of personal information but this is the important part:

""Jess, 
In addition, we have decided on cremation. Please let me know if you would like any of her ashes. I can even get them made into jewelry or put in an urn for you and have it shipped if that's easier for you.""

She replied to that one thanking me and telling me she would rather not have the ashes and that I could do what I liked with them. 

We did. We gave some to my mother, had some turned into jewelry for my wife and three younger girls, I kept some and we buried some in a few of her favorite places. At this point the only ashes that physically exist are mine, my mother's, and my wife/daughters'. 

Fast forward to the end of February and I get an email from her stating that she'd had a change of heart and asking if she could have some of our daughter's ashes. 

I told her that unfortunately we didn't have any ""left"", but that my wife offered to send her the necklace she had made. She declined and did seem a little offended that we'd offered but it was all we had to give. 

A few days ago I received notice that she was suing me for emotional damages for ""failing to offer her our shared child's cremains"" and ""offering a used necklace"" and some other nonsense. 

I'm going to be honest: I feel like the only person who is being emotionally damaged here is me. I'm dealing with a huge devastating loss of my first child, my best buddy, my constant companion while also dealing with the stress of the pandemic/lockdown, two young kids who don't understand, AND a brand new baby (born end of March). I feel like I've been nothing but nice and communicative to her and this is what I get for it? 

I'm angry, I'm tired, and I'm frustrated. Realistically, I don't even have the emotional energy to fight it and I'm seriously considering throwing some money at it and hoping it goes away. Is that the best solution?"
74,Police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while I was asleep,"This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair

I have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

75,Lyft charged me $100 for throwing up in my drivers car on the way to the bar on NYE. I was sober at the time with my girl friend and neither of us threw up. What should I do?,"North Carolina: Lyft has pictures of his stained car with food strewn about. Looks like possible throw up, but in now way was caused by us. Also some of the throw up was on the seat we were sitting directly on...

His car was already a mess when he arrived. We would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. We were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later I was charged $100. What can or should I do?

Update: Lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. Also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver “Roy” (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... Who the fuck is Roy and where is my fucking money! 

Looking in to get the info behind the photos. Still no reply from Lyft. Used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.

Will update soon with photos ."
76,"Me and my girlfriend broke up, i own my condo it is only in my name. She won't leave, and last night she denied me entry to my own unit.

She agreed to move out by end of February. Then COVID happened, and now she refuses to leave.

I have 1 bedroom in my apartment, and i am tired of sleeping on my couch. Lately she has started denying me entry into my own unit. She uses the deadbolt on the inside and pretends to not hear me. Last night when i came home around 11 pm, i discovered i couldn't get into my apartment as she had dead bolted it.

After pounding/calling after an hour She started screaming at me to go away. I ended up calling the police who after talking to her briefly he told me to go find somewhere else to stay for the night and said i needed to leave. I slept all of last night in my car.

This morning, after she left for work i removed the deadbolt from my door. I also discovered a complete and utter stranger sleeping in my living room, along with another girl passed out in my bed.

After i kicked them out, my ex came home and told me i have no rights to kick out her guests. She called the police and the officer said it was a civil issue (by this time her guests had already left).

Tonight i have a late shift again, and i guarantee you the same thing is going to happen. What am i supposed to do? What kind of lawyer do i need?

Can someone please help me? I live in Toronto, Ontario.

77,Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread."
78,"My sister was the victim of $200,000 loss, most of her life savings, because T-Mobile allowed someone with a fake ID get access to her SIM. Can she win a case by sueing them for damages?","A scammer walked into a T-Mobile with a fake ID of my brother-in-law, switched my sister's SIM to a phone he owned to perform what is called a ""Sim Swap Scam"". He then stole everything from her online cryptocurrency accounts, and probably has info and access to every part of her life. 

T-Mobile ideally should be held accountable for allowing this to happen, but I'm not sure if it holds up because I haven't seen any cases that have won in this exact scenario. What can she do?

Edit: A few details: We live in a Southern State in the US and the scammer walked into a TMobile store in California.

79,Mother keeps sending police to my apartment for welfare checks,"I’m 23 and have been living away from my mother since I was 18. She has sent police to my house / school / work multiple times over the past 5 years. The only reason she does this is because I don’t reply to text messages quickly enough (I’m talking 30 minutes and she’s panicking and sending police to find me). I have been very explicit in telling her to not do this. I have set up a rule where she must give me 48 hours to reply. I recently increased this to a week. She has ignored all of this and instead threatened to file a missing person report if I didn’t reply. Literally 2 days ago she moved within 8 minutes of me when I said I didn’t want her living that close. 

I feel harassed and frightened in my own home. I am done trying to work this out with her. Is there any legal recourse I can take?

80,[MN] A girl is planning to claim I am the father of her baby when we never had sex,"I've been living in a foster home since January '18. I turn 15 in March. The foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. She blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. I never had sex with her, and I would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. Unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. The foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

I can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. I said I would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks I will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. She is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her."
81,"Neighbors entrusted me with looking after their pets/house for 3 weeks, it has been almost a year now and they haven't come back. Today their basement flooded, and i have no idea what to do.","In June 2019 my neighbors came to my door, i had some experiences with them (they invited us for a BBQ not long after they moved in). They asked me and my wife if we would look after their pets, and their house for the next 3 weeks, as they needed to return to Taiwan as his mother was dying. They even left me $500 dollars for food for their 2 German Shepards, and their cat.

I don't know what happened to them, but they just never came back. I don't know if they ended up in some sort of prison, or decided to just not come home at all. Today i found out their basement had flooded, probably sometime within the last week. Apparently a pipe burst, but the entire basement is completely fucked. I paid for have the leak fixed, and i spent all of today using my shop vac to drain their basement to the best of my abilities.

Between this and one of their dogs needing surgery i have spent several thousand dollars of my own money, and frankly the damage to the basement was pretty awful. I don't have their insurance paperwork, and don't really know if i can even do a claim for them.

On top of this his two giant German Shepards while they are amazingly good boys, it is becoming almost too much for us to handle. Their last name is extremely common, and their Facebook profiles are private. Which gives me very little avenue to tackle this down.

Timeline:

* June 07, 2019 - Neighbors asked me if i would look after their pets, and their house while they were handling the death of his mother back in Taiwan. Told me 3 weeks at latest.
* July 1st, 2019 - Neighbors sent me an email stating they needed some additional time to handle his father's affairs. He apologized and said he would be back by July 15th at latest.
* July 21st, 2019 - Sent him an email asking what was going on, explained how we were going on vacation in August. Never got a response.
* July 31st, 2019 - Tried calling him on his cellphone, # he was given to me was no longer in service.
* August 14th, 2019 - Went on vacation, had my brother look after all 4 dogs, for the next week.
* September 2nd, 2019 - Emailed him again, no response.
* September 3rd, 2019 - Tried to reach him and his wife via Facebook using the private message feature.
* September 6th, 2019 - Ended up moving his 2 dogs, 1 cat into our house as they seemed extremely miserable. I ended up disassembling part of our adjoined fence to allow his dogs to use their outdoor area.
* November 19th, 2019 - One of his dogs started showing signs of being ill, brought him to the vet turns out he is suffering from a medium severity case of IVDD. He ended up requiring surgery which we paid for.
* January 21st, 2020 - Sent another email and never got a response.
* Today - When i was bringing his mail in to his house, i noticed it smelled pretty awful and i quickly discovered his basement had about a foot of water in it.

Questions:

* What exactly is my level of responsibility in this. I agreed to look after it for a few weeks/couple of months at the most. It has almost been a year now.
* Is there anything i can do?

**Location: Ontario, Canada**

Sorry some other points:

* I am assuming they have some sort of auto payment for bills setup, because they still have hydro/cable/internet.
* I am unsure where exactly the husband worked, i know he said he was an engineer, however i cannot find his linked in profile, so i don't know what company.
* Their last name is a very common name (common like Wong), which gives me tons of facebook results. "
82,NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

Early in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9skxh8/i_was_arrested_kept_in_jail_for_62_days_and_then/?utm_source=reddit-android

I've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. I want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. I can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. There most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

To answer the endless messages I received about race, I am white and early 20's, the person I was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

I spoke to my boss and HR and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with OT. Also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

84,"UPDATE - [MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy. Thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice."

UPDATE 2.5: There’s been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don’t need to always make a “special request” to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it’s a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is “not an obstructive item”.

Amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3


UPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA “escalating out of control”. They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don’t want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 But that it’s up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don’t want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

She assured me that I won’t get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I’m NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don’t plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

For those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I’m a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

Forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It’s just that I talked back (“no I don’t but okay“) and I regret that so much. 

Halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

Someone asked if it’s a racial thing. I’m not white but it’s probably not a related to race. 

Many of you guys advised not to delete the post and keep it here in case this happens to someone else and they need answers. Hope this helps.

UPDATE 1: Thank you so much for your quick advice on a Sunday morning! I memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

As we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

“The police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights.” 

“Ok.” 

“Oh I hope so.” As she walked away. 

I burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. 

There was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I’ve been an emotional wreck and can’t stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. 

My seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. 

Thank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least!

Original post: 

I can’t believe this is happening to me. I’m flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don’t have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

Edit: I’ve looked all over the internet and can’t find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

Here’s what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

“You have to put your feet on the ground!” I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

“No I don’t but okay.” As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I’ve taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it’s technically not allowed by some rule I’m not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
“Would you like to go back to the gate? We’re gonna go back to the gate!” And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
“Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.”

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, “no I don’t but okay” are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic inside. I’m now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. 

Am I fucked?"
88,Kicked our at 16. Parents took all my money.,"I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

Three nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

I managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. 

I'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations. 

I live in Tennessee. Any advice would be helpful. 

I also do not want to return home. My mother is abusive. DCS has seen physical evidence of abuse (black eye, bloody scratch marks, bruises) and placed me back in the home. They are useless."
89,Work Punishments Include Drinking Soap and Other Abuse,"My girlfriend works at a retail store in California. They are supposed to ask customers if they want to buy a particular item and there is a punishment board for not doing so. The employee is allowed to choose their punishment from a punishment board.

The punishments are either very hard and often demeaning work or obviously illegal punishments. The hard work is things like cleaning toilets or moving heavy objects. Other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

Is this illegal? They could argue these obviously illegal punishments are not mandatory, but there is an incentive to do them because the other punishments are so difficult."
90,[NE] Poisoned at family dinner,"I’m currently on vacation visiting family for Christmas. I’m [20 F] a vegan by choice (however I am allergic to red meat.... I was bitten by a “lone star tick” which caused me to develop a severe allergy to meat) 
My family makes fun of me for being vegan (though I cook for myself for all meals and don’t mention It much at all) Anyway, I guess some of my extended family didn’t know the severity of my allergy because my younger cousin [16 M] chopped up steak (extremely finely I guess) and put It in my butternut squash soup.
Shorty after I ate some of my soup I couldn’t breath and was breaking out in hives. I woke up in the hospital on Christmas Day. (My mom called an ambulance when she saw my face was swelling). My cousin didn’t say sorry when I started breaking out in hives. He started laughing and told me what he had done.
I woke up to a text from him saying “stop overreacting you need protein” with a picture of a slaughtered cow. His parents aren’t very well off (in fact I don’t think they have insurance). I just want to know, should I pursue a legal case? Or is that an overreaction.

91,"My niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.","Located in Oklahoma, USA

My sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.

Update: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. Thank you to the people who were helpful!"
92,[UPDATE] I'm pregnant and being investigated by DCS.,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

Thanks again, everybody. Truly."
93,"Returned a $1,175 computer back to Walmart and they refuse to refund the money.","Hi all! So I put a gaming comp on layaway with Walmart a few weeks ago so I could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

I finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. So I returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as I was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a Walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

Well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

We did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn’t good enough?? She said that it had a “different balance” on all the receipts but that’s because it was layaway and I made payments! 

She told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? 

I’m totally distraught, I’m a college student and I don’t have extra funds this was something I worked hard for. 

Any and all advice is welcome I’m desperate. I am in the US, specifically Florida

EDIT: I understand now, Walmart was not the best place to buy the PC, I get it. The reason I did was so I could make payments the way I wanted. Hindsight is 20/20 "
94,My daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her,"(WI) Just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

Left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

On the second day I was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman I had never seen before in my life. 

I jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she’d found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman’s intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

I drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

I was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. 

This occurred on Friday and I have yet to receive a response. I would like to know if I can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if I can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. Thanks.

95,"Exwife is going off the deep end. This is in NJ, USA. Can I do anything here?","I get my daughter every other weekend. She’s 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

This weekend, we were watching a movie when I got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

Now, I don’t attach myself to my phone (unless I’m working) and I got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I’d be up to tuck her in. 

I went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone “YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!”

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn’t true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear “daddy is going to leave the room now, please don’t stay on the phone long, it’s way past your bedtime.” (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he’s a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she’s repeating “I’m sorry” into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn’t until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn’t speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

I’m sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. Divorce is hard enough on children, and I think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be. 

What can I do?"
96,"UPDATE: Hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. Building management’s negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (TO, Canada)","Link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

First I want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and I are quite happy with. I’ve been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

Through the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me “if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?” To which I replied “150%”. He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said “no.” 

Shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don’t want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn’t seem happy. As if the whole floor isn’t already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

I explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. 

The bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I’m guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

The city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they “didn’t know” and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from “submit a maintenance request” to “we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately” in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

Thank you so much Reddit!!! I couldn’t have done it without your help!! 

Here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. "
97,Police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him,"This happened last week, he's only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords."

Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200B;

So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?"
99,(va) My son stole a rare toy from my brother. My brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. What do I do?,"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.

&#x200B;

Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200B;

Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200B;

I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?"
100,(Ohio) Woman sent me video of her setting my priceless painting (family heirloom) on fire because I called CPS on her,"My boyfriend’s sister in law abuses and over medicated her autistic child so I called Child Protective services on her months ago. I was living up there near his family and long story short, when I drove home for the holidays (was just supposed to be a short trip but all hell broke loose and my boyfriend quickly packed everything we owned and followed me down a few days later) He forgot this one painting that has been in the family for over 100 years and my grandfather gave it to me before he died 14 years ago. She and her husband sent me a video saying “this is for calling CPS, bitch.” They’re both clearly seen in the video and called it a priceless painting. 

Do I have any ground to sue or press charges? I wanted to see if anyone here might have advice before I go and shell out my savings for a lawyer. This was literally my most prized possession and my heart is in so many pieces because my grandfather gave it to me so long ago. I would give everything I own just to get it back. I’m living in Florida and this is all in Ohio. "
101,"Bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because I dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?","I have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way I dress. My neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

About a month ago, I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. I didn't expect any trouble. My first introduction to this woman, let's call her Karen, was my first week here. I went to check the mail and I wasn't wearing a bra. I had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. Karen is one of *those* Southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. You know the type. She waved at me and I waved back, trying to be pleasant. She came at me, I thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying. 

This is in Florida, by the way.

EDIT: I got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (I do not regularly dress like this) I must have been quite a sight to Karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. She started laying into me. I just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then I said ""you can stop the games, Karen. I see the way you look at me, I know you want me."" Her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""I'll pray for you."" Then scurried away. Actually went inside her house. 😂"

TL;DR of last post: Got a letter from a firm to prepare for a lawsuit for battery to someone i preformed the Heimlich on. 


Well, I took y’alls advice and went back to the restaurant, i spent about an hour and a half waiting and then speaking with a shift manager who called the general manager who called the owner, and they swore up and down that no one had come to ask for a tape or anything of the sort. 

Then i started looking for defense attorneys but I wasn’t sure exactly how to proceed, honestly this week i’ve been mortified and really on edge. Finally when i told my friends about everything one of them fessed up to the fact that it was actually them and they made it up as some kind of prank. Pretty twisted joke, I wasn’t laughing. I’m pretty pissed and seriously reconsidering my relationship with him. I appreciate everyone’s support, excluding the people who made fun of my mother’s death or tried to figure out where i lived. 

TL;DR: Friend made a fake letter from a law firm, soon he might be able to sue me for battery "

105,My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200B;

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200B;

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

&#x200B;

Is there anything they can do at this point? I feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. It makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it."
106,A male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. He just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.,"Spa is in Maryland. A friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it’s ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. He is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. He has not spoken with management yet. He just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. Any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

Edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it’s a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

I’m guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. The mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

Thank you everyone for the comments. If this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. "
107,Update: Neighbor bangs on shared duplex wall when baby cries,"Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/isdpid/delusional_neighbor_bangs_on_the_shared_wall_when/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My first post never got much attention but the outcome was pretty wild. 

Short version: In October 2020, my husband and I were renting in a duplex where my FIL owned the half we lived in, and a separate family (adult daughter acting as caregiver to elderly mother) owned the other half. We brought our son home from the NICU in August, and towards the end of September the neighbor (40sF) started to pound on the shared wall if she could hear him cry. The pounding escalated over the next two months. The neighbor bought a megaphone to yell through the wall and threatened to “rip us apart”, she called us child predators, and she’d yell obscenities and threats until 3 or 4 in the morning. 

The police were called multiple times, nothing could be done about it. One officer told us “I’m going to kill you. See, it doesn’t mean anything if I don’t actually do it.” The elderly mother hadn’t been seen in several months, but requests for wellness checks were brushed off. 

The general advice I got was that as renters, we couldn’t do anything. It was also suggested that this was reasonable behavior, since the crying baby was probably really annoying. 

Since my first post, we moved in with my grandmother for our safety. The neighbor ended up busting a softball sized hole through the shared wall to scream at us, and occasionally just stare at us. The smell that came out of the hole was indescribably bad. Our security cameras recorded her coming to my son’s nursery window at around 2am almost daily, just staring and holding her cat. 

It took until the end of January for the police to be able to enter her property. The elderly mother had been deceased since at least June, and the daughter had the corpse dressed in her Sunday best, rotting in a dead bolted bedroom. The news article said the mother died from natural causes. The daughter was taken to an inpatient psychiatric facility."
108,"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I’m a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She’s grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather’s mom died. He’s Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather’s sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I’ve tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it’s starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I’m studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I’m not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she’s my little sister, and I’ve been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I’m a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn’t get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I’m barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven’t even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we’re now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

Edit: Thank you for all you advice. I apologize if I do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

Edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. However, I am currently ok, and my mom’s friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and I also have a little bit saved up. But I greatly appreciate your generosity"
109,"My daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (Washington)","On a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  She says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  So far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

We talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  This has not helped.  We escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  Not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

The principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  The read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  The principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

We are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  It shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  What obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?"
110,"Campus effectively removed all Men's restrooms, Administration is dragging its feet acknowledging there is a problem","New York State, United States

&#x200B;

So essentially with few exceptions, every male restroom on my campus has been converted into an ""All-Gender"" restroom. This sort of makes sense given that they are the only existing restrooms which contain both stalls and urinals. The problem herein lies that in addition to new signs on the doors, the primary door to the restroom has been equipped with a vacancy/occupied lock which locks from the inside. Essentially allowing a single individual (if they choose) to lock a bathroom with facilities accommodating up to 8 people at one time, reducing it to a single use restroom. On numerous occasions men have had to leave lecture halls and travel to other buildings with the hope that the All-Gender restroom in that building has not been locked also.

I've brought this issue to our school's department of diversity and equity where after 3 weeks of obfuscation I've managed to meet with with the department head and have a conversation with her, where I've essentially been told to shove it.

Is there any sort of Federal or NYS legislation with which I can bring to their attention and try to instigate real change?

However my car gets towed EVERY 2 am and I have to pay the driver 60$ every morning despite showing him my decal. He says although the decal is official, the head of my HOA who lives in my neighborhood keeps reporting my car to get it towed and once he gets the order I have to pay him to get my car back. As much as I hate to be this person, I am the only black person in my community and he has made it clear that he doesn't like my family living there and had always given us a hard time since he moved in 3 years ago (my family has lived here for over 23 years). Is there anything I can legally do about this? Thank you.

Edit: thanks for all the help everyone! I have no idea how to contact HOA or the property manager as my mother deals with them and every time the car was getting towed except the last time, she was the one to catch them and pay. I will be contacting the HOA with her when she gets home and will try and contact the property manager. My neighbor is a dick and and I will also be speaking to him personally when I get home. If legal action needs to be taken, we will definitely do so. Thank you!

Edit: talked to the property manager and they said they rescinded my permit. I asked them why and they said that they aren't doing those anymore. I told them they never gave me any indication of that and they said they didn't not plan on giving me any notice.

Edit: Final Update! 
Thank you everyone! I honestly could not have expected to get this much help! As of what happens next, we plan on taking legal action, mainly to get our money back, and because it seems that what may have happened with the permits wasn't strictly legal. I still need to talk personally with the HOA guy who conveniently doesn't answer his door when I knock, but he has two big ass dogs and will have to walk them eventually. It seems HOA tend to suck, especially in SoFlo. Thank you!"

116,"[US, OK] Disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.","To give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. There aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

I have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. By some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. For the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

The family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. From the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. Through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. These are VERY powerful, VERY fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

We've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. We've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. They have to be picked up on the street.

What can we do?

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, we have confronted the neighbor and yes he intentionally did it knowing the kids were epilitic. He hates kids, and has made it very apparent even calling the lights ""brat repellent""."

[Florida]","This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. "
120,Girls assaulted nephew by kicking genitals. He’s in Emergancy surgery,"This afternoon I found out girls have been kicking my nephew in the crotch at school. He’s 12 years old and I imagine they’re close to his age. He told his grandmother he had bad pain and they went to the ER. The doc said 1 testicle is most likely dead and they’re trying to save it and check on the other in surgery. 
How can we move forward with this legally? He will very likely lose a testicle and may have serious health issues because of it. I can’t find much online except there is a class 3 felony of malicious castration, but I don’t know what that really means. I’m very angry and want justice for this child. Any advice on how we could move forward is helpful. I want them to pursue criminal charges and hold these people and their parents (or the school!) responsible for this life altering violent crime.

Edit: they live in NC. I don’t know the ages of girls but it’s happening at a middle school."
121,"UPDATE: Old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues I'm having."" Found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (MN)","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200B;

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200B;

***Thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. It's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. Glad to not be there anymore. I also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people."
122,Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point."
123,Update: I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. Can someone help me please?,"I posted this a few weeks ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

I just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). I was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

He was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. One of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). Unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

He gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

I also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* They both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. They aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* Apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. With her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. So now she is paying her way. 

Anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

Thank you so much for your help."
124,[WI] My girlfriend’s landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.,"My girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. He believed nobody to. Be home, but I was here laying in bed. I woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. When I said something as he was leaving he ignored me. I text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. He did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. He just came in, used the bathroom and left. He didn’t even finish flushing the toilet. 

When I confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. He then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. And when I explained to him that I had every right to be there because I had permission from the tenant to be there, he said “okay, I’ll let you go this time.” 

My girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. How can we make sure he doesn’t do this again? 

Also, the dude didn’t even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

Edit 1: the landlord is the property owner.

Edit 2: there was an empty unit across the hall."
125,"[UPDATE] This man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, I have a specific question regarding something I want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.","I would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here’s what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone’s day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid’s drone and frank’s drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would’ve ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father’s reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like “mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I’ll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away”."
126,"TSA detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the ER and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.","I'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

My father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a [port](https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  We came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (New York) facing the customer directly at our shop. They sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. I'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. However, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

Today, they were flying from TN (I don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to Houston, TX, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   He had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (Brooklyn, NY) and in Texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which I will request from his doctors tomorrow)  He also brings a printout from the TSA about traveling with a port and cancer which I will find the exact link to when I get more info.  

My parents arrive 3:45 to a Tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
Both parents have TSA pre and get on line at about 4. They are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  The agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the ID, etc.  My father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. Meanwhile I assume he is not speaking his best English, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. I'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which I think adds to the confusion. They wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. They don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

Both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  They go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   My father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  He calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  He tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (His first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) They take him into a small room away from my mother. He is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  The agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. The agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  My father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  I have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. He couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

He tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) The agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   The agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. My father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  They bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  They wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  They agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  They take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. He asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. By this point the plane has left.  They go to the ER to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

He has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  My father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  Port is OK but they want to check him out again before flying.

I would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. If he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  Can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? They have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. I am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so I have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that I can go over with her later, so I'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
My family is very quiet, I don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  I would if that is the only option, however.  I don't know if it's relevant that we are Muslim, either, I assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  My father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  I would love some advice.  Apologies for length.
Edit- I do not know if this is correct flair, if you want me to change it please advise."
127,I think my dads company is responsible for his death [California],"My dad passed away last week while at work. He had a massive heart attack. He was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. Here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

The doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. Last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so I'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

I spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. Is that true? I'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, I can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. "
128,Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"[The Mystery Fence](https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nQdq)

Delaware, USA. No homeowners association.

We live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. It's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. There was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). I removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

Well I come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. Part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. The leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

I don't know who owns it, so I called the real estate agent. He was just as shocked as I was when I told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. He had no idea. He'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. I asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. She didn't.

What do I do about this fence?"

130,Neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. It was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. How can I proceed legall?,"Long story short, I live in NY. My bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. I had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. Those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. This lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) I came home to my wood missing and I found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. Someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. I contacted the guy, and got it back. I then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the NY State Government Property Lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. I told her to never do that again and mind her own business. Her response was ""I am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. Good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" After that passive aggressive bullshit I went to the police. I filed for tresspassing. The cop said I could get her for possible larceny. Idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. I'm just wondering... how far can I push this? I am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town I live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. The cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... I have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people I didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that I had posted on my own FB that I was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. I work as a bartender in town, where I have many strange men I dont want knowing where I live. She posted it to my towns Facebook page. Maybe if she was more kind I would have let bygons be bygons but now, I'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear"""
131,(Update) School kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. Lawyers are expensive...,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

The past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. Now I can't go into a lot of the details after but I can go over some of the details that happened during.

We contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. We first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

Our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. Then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. So he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. Talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which I thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

He spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. During this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. Something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

So our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. The lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

Finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

Now I can't go into a lot of the details but I can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. Lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. I just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. We are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

Thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school."
132,"Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

I own an apartment in downtown Toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with AirBnB tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. Currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until January.

I decided to list my place up for a rental in late August, for rental until Janaury. Since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). I immediately got a hit by a person named Jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.She signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""No short term rentals, through services such as AirBnB"".

Yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* On Monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. Along with a strong smell of pot. They apparently identified themselves as AirBnB renters. (Apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through AirBnB).
* I am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* I am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* Apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

After getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on AirBnB, using very recent photos of my apartment. I tried to contact Jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

I have tried numerous times to talk to AirBnB, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

Aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. Unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. Do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*EDIT\* I forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. Since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. I want to stop randoms from AirBnB from entering my apartment now. "

When I went back to work I talked to my boss about the bullying and them knocking off my cap and I said it's making me miserable but again he didn't care. So I said that what they are doing is harassment and because they make fun of my speech impediment it's discrimination and if he doesn't do anything he's responsible for it. I saw he was pissed but still he talked to his boss. Then when he came back he yelled at me and the bullies for creating trouble and I thought we were going to be fired but that was it.  But then the next day the owner came (that rarely happens) and he talked to my boss and then to me, he told me the bullying would stop and to tell him if it didn't. At first the guys who were bullying me were moved to another part of the shop so they wouldn't be with me but the next day one of them was fired, not sure if it's over the bullying. Anyway it's good now thanks to you and I don't need to find a new job.

I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens. 

"
135,Girlfriend was arrested w/ a DUI but blew a .06!!! Cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!,"So..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. She didn’t drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. When the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). On her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. A minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. She admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

This is when it gets interesting. 

The officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. He then declared that she was drunk WITHOUT HAVING HER BLOW TO TEST HER BAC, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

THEN, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! That’s below the legal limit (we are in Wyoming). And the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her BAC was. 

My question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? We have no money and probably can’t afford a good lawyer. I could barely afford her bail. She is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn’t deter her from pursuing her dream. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. We have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

Edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn’t tell her the Miranda rights (found out he doesn’t need to)


Edit: thank you all so much for the help

Edit: I am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). In this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. It was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an Uber. 

🚨Update 🚨
After reviewing the body cam footage, the prosecutor dismissed the case. I haven’t seen the footage myself, but according to her lawyer it was clear that she was not impaired."
136,My parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. I am sick of this shit (Florida),"For clarity we're both minors. I'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. She has never been right since we were little kids. Always violent. She bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when I was 5 because I wouldn't let her ride my bike. All of my life I've been putting up with this shit and I have had enough.

She hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. My parents wont do anything about it. She's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. I really don't know what is wrong with her. She's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. My parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. They refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". Which brings us to today. My parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. Whatever, not important.

Anyway, I was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. We decided to go to the Dollar Tree to get some snacks. Demon didn't buy anything. As we left the store I could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. I confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! I don't know why. Don't they make meth out of those or something? So I told her I was going to call mom. I pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! I was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was I going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. I took her down and had her pinned on the ground. That's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will NOT stop otherwise. I had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. She got me in the throat and I was letting her go! I was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. Blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

It took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. It hurts like a bitch. My friend gave me a bunch of Tylenol and it still hurts. I came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *I* do to upset her?! I was so angry I told them I was calling the cops and my dad told me I couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! Is that true??? 

Something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and I'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  Please help me. 

Update: Well shit went down basically how I expected it would. My mom called me very upset that police had came. What happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. I asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her Baker Acted because I was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. Well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and I guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. My mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. She said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved. "
137,[Update] Is it arson if I burn down a building that I own?,"Hi everyone, came here to give an update as many people asked.

The burning of the barn finally happened! We went to the fire department and asked about a controlled burn. They said it might be OK under certain conditions but they had to do an inspection first. They made us remove all that could have produced toxic fumes and pollution, like old tires and the ruins of a tractor. The wood was dry and there was almost no paint left so they said it was fine to burn. They were actually glad for the opportunity because they had a new guy to train. They said they would do protection of the other buildings and nearby bush and it would be a productive training session for them.

When the day finally came they let us start the fire (more of a symbol than anything, they did the ""real"" starting for safety reasons). The fire had to be helped a bit because it had rained a lot the days before, but then the whole barn was engulfed at once, it was beautiful in a way. I must say it burned spectacularly well, there was almost nothing left in the end, which is exactly what we wanted. For those of you who were worried about us burning valuable stuff, we did keep some tools and a pile of boards that we will sell but there wasn't much more than that, except if you can find value in porn magazines from the 80s, empty bottles and nude girls calendars. These were my father's possessions so we had a lot of pleasure in letting them burn. We added his clothes for good measure. We likely could have sold more of the barn wood, but there was more purpose for us in burning it all down. Probably won't solve the deeper issues of what our father did but it did bring some relief and some sense of closure.

Unfortunately we couldn't throw the big BBQ party we wanted for the fire department (we did have some beer though) because of Covid restrictions, but we all decided to do it later, hopefully next summer. The firemen were real bros, really cool but professional, and they seemed to have as much fun as we did. We're really thankful for their help, you rock guys."
138,the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action [TX],"When I was 14, I was raped by a close family friend. I got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when I was 15. I knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but I did not know their names or what they were like. We received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. I do not remember signing anything.  I do not know what happened to the friend; I asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. My mother said he was jailed but I don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. I  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. My husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200B;

A month ago, I received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. I believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. She told me that she wanted to get to know me. I spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. I found myself disgusted by her. There are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. She is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. I decided that I would not be comfortable meeting her. I blocked her without responding. After a week, I began to receive letters from her. Four letters in total. I did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. I finally answered. I told her that I was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or I would get the police involved.

&#x200B;

She  began to berate me. She told me  that my family was her family. She accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that I had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that I had held back important information. Without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  She told me that she would be making contact with my family whether I liked it or not. She also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if I did not comply and that I could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. When I began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. If I agreed to pay for a round of IVF, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. Here are my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if I tell her to stay away?
2. Could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. My parents are dead and I do not know how to find out information about the adoption. I did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. I am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. Could I be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. I have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. Could I form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if I agreed to pay?

Edit: amount asked for was removed. Also, because several people have asked: I do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. It only stopped once I left the state. I am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and I will need to move again.  "
139,My brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. What actions should I take against him?,"Hello. I'm a first-time poster, and I'm also on mobile. I am 19, and I currently live in New York City.

My parents died when my brothers and I were young (Eldest was 11, Second (the brother in question) was 7, and I was 5). They left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. I turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. It was in March 2019 that I finally got it. It turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. I decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. I wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

Yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. I called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after I deposited the money. My savings account has also been taken from. I'll admit, I really should have been paying more attention, but I was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and I got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. We tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. He had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

When I confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. He spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. I know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. It's just line after line of Uber Eats, Postmates, and game purchases. My grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. It would take YEARS for him to make that money back on minimum wage. Should I call the police and have him arrested? Is there any way to get that money back?


Edit: Okay, I've decided to call the police and sue the bank. I know how to get my hands on bank statements, and I'll record him confessing to the theft. But I don't know how to hire a lawyer. Where do I start?

Edit #2: Okay I just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. My grandma sends him to the store with her ATM card sometimes to get money. He memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

Edit #3: Thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. I got a ton of messages and I'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

I've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. We're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. Haven't gotten him arrested yet, but I told her if need be, I would call them myself.

I like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. My mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. She explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. She had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an ATM.

Edit #4: So I went to the bank. Because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. No case to sue the bank with. There's nothing I can do to get the money back. I'm ruined financially. All I can do is sue him and put him in jail, but I'm never gonna see that money again. I'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and I'm sorry if I haven't responded to your messages yet. Also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. This will be the last edit I make, hopefully."
140,[US-NC] School nurse refuses treatment over dislike of essential oils,"I felt nauseous after being sick for a few weeks, so I went to the nurse's office. There was only one nurse there, and I was the only student there. I explained my situation, and requested that due to my athsma, she turn off her essential oil diffuser. She refused. Two more students came in, and they explained what problem they had. Both of them said that the essential oils were making it hard to breathe, and she denied that this was even possible. I believe that one of them had athsma. I was having a large amount of difficulty breathing, so I told her that this was a health and safety issue. She got angry and asked me to leave the room. She had not yet attempted to diagnose me. Is there any way I can report her? This is a charter school, meaning that while it is a public school, it is not part of a district."

*Now back to the original post...*

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/akw5d2/georgia_just_found_out_husband_fabricated_entire/).

It's been a little bit over a year since I turned to this community as my life fell rather dramatically to pieces around me. My original post didn't get a ton of attention, but the replies I received helped me tremendously, and seeing where I am a year later may also provide some hope for those going through their own crisis. In particular, you helped me construct my initial list of immediate-to-do items, and put me on the right track to figure out how to extricate myself from the relationship.

The day I first posted here was the day I found out that my then-husband had lied and fabricated most of what I knew about him. Other things I did that day included teaching a class to 200 undergrads about 15 minutes after I found out for sure, and kicking off a day-and-a-half long job interview for the next stage in my career (a job which I *somehow* landed...).

What unfolded over the following three months can really only be described as living my way through my own version of a Lifetime movie. At some point I moved into an extended stay hotel, and as time passed I learned about the depths and breadths of the lies and deceit he'd used to both control me and get what he wanted, and the lengths he'd go to try and get his grip back on what he'd successfully manipulated his way through for about four years. What I know now -- and what I'm kind of glad I didn't really know then -- was that I wasn't actually as safe with him as I thought I was. So I'm thankful I managed to get out with only psychological/emotional/financial burden, and no physical trauma.

About two-and-a-half months later I successfully had my marriage annulled on the basis of Fraudulent Coercion to Marry. I ended up doing the necessary research and filing the paperwork myself -- which was not an easy task, but was both cheaper and faster than it was going to be if I hired a lawyer. A few weeks after the annulment I moved my belongings out of our apartment and moved to a new city and my new job. Without him, but with the kittens. As of late June I finally had him convinced that contacting me was pointless because he wasn't getting me back, and so I've been largely free to recover from the trauma and crisis mode I lived in for about three months.

One of the things I've learned from all of this is how incredibly difficult it is to get out of a relationship in a situation like this. Besides the obvious difficulty of navigating the legal system, and the cost associated with it, there's the cognitive dissonance of constantly trying to remember to relate to that other person in light of the new information you've found out about them. It really and truly took every life skill and tremendous support of my family and friends network to get out in (more or less) one piece. And even still the road to recovery and a return to thriving is a long one.

So...thanks to those who helped me back on that terrible day in January 2019. And if you know someone who is going through something like this, please offer whatever you can in support. Because they definitely need it!"
142,"[UPDATE] [Texas] My Mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. However, the police is still alive, and when I showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. How can I get my cat back?","Link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

Hello,

First off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. I didn’t feel like advice to steal my cat back was ‘legal’ (thus, being in this subreddit), so I took one users advice to talk to the director of Animal Control in my mom’s city.

She basically told me that the police have no idea what they’re doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. She said that the only thing I can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as ‘stolen property’. She said the police will understand what to do if a I reference my cat as ‘property’ and not an animal.

I went to the police station and the police threw me around again. Despite I tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn’t ‘property’. After 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom’s texts. 

The cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, I can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my ‘stolen property’.

We get to my mom’s house and she’s not there. We look around the outside of her house and find no signs of Kitty either. I call her and ask her where she is, and told her that I was at her house with the police. She said, in quote, “I took the cat and ran off into Oklahoma and I’m not ever coming back.” 

The police said they can’t help me since they don’t have jurisdiction in Oklahoma. 

I went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so I left because I can’t afford it. On my way home, I contacted Adult Protective Services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. So I hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

I also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into Oklahoma. My mom played the ‘poor me’ card, so my family bought into it. And somehow, I’m now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... When I got home, I cut everyone out. All of my family. I separated every single tie I had to them.

I’ve had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if I’m being open about the situation, I was a victim of childhood abuse. That cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me I won’t be able to get him back. I ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now I’m getting help for my own mental health. This situation broke me, and right now, I’m trying to recover.

Thank you everyone for listening. 

**Tl;dr:** My cat is gone and I’ll never get him back."
143,UPDATE: My Landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. Wtf do i do.,"Because I know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  You all helped break the cycle of panic.

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

I specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""You can't do in-home hospice here"".  


Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :( 

Thanks LA.   "
144,Can my parents force a paternity test UPDATE,"Last post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can\_my\_parents\_force\_a\_pregnancy\_test/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can_my_parents_force_a_pregnancy_test/)

&#x200B;

I'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

Pretty soon after I posted, I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. I knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so I googled the law firm and lawyer's name. I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200B;

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

Thanks again for the advice everyone!"
145,"[KS] Sister (19F) woke up during a colonoscopy. Sister tried to bring up her upsettedness, doctor told her he ""didn't have a pill to cure being a dramatic young woman"".","Basically what the title says. My mother took my sister to the doctor to drive her after. 

Sister goes in for a colonoscopy. She wakes up during the procedure. She admits she was kicking up a fuss, she was too sedated to actually verbalize her pain so she basically just screamed/cried. She could hear the doctor telling the nurses ""this sometimes happens during the procedure, it's just the body's response. I know it's upsetting but she's not awake and can't feel anything"".

When it's over and my sister is back in her room, my sister told my mom what happened (she was still crying and extremely upset, it was painful but also terrifying to not be understood by the doctors). The doctor came in to tell them how it went, and immediately launched into this speech about ""Yeah sorry she's crying, all young women do this. It's called 'being a teenage girl', we see it all the time here."" My mom says ""Uh she's saying she was awake during the procedure.""

The doctor had this look of shock on his face. He kind of rambles for a while and then jumps into this thing about ""Well her blood pressure was getting too low so we couldn't give her any more sedation."" My mom said ""Alright... But she's in a lot of pain here, is there something we can do about that?"" The doctor literally said ""If I could give you a pill to cure being a young woman, I would. But I can't, so she's all yours mom"" and he left.

The nurse was horrified and said ""You should not be seeing this doctor again"". The nurse apologized a bunch and gave my family a referral to a new doctor.

We're going to file a complaint with our state regarding his comments about not having a pill to cure being a young woman. Is there anything else we should be doing?

Edit: I've gotten some helpful comments, but I want to clarify that while the waking up during a colonoscopy (and yes, she was supposed to be asleep during that time - I do know that they're often performed awake but this one was not supposed to be done that way) is upsetting, we're all mostly upset about the fact that he ignored my sister's pain/discomfort because she was ""a young woman""."
146,"Doctor sewed my vagina shut after delivering my baby, can I sue?","This might be a weird story, but I had my first child six weeks and three days ago. During delivery, I tore and had to get stitches. The doctor on call didn't tell me how many stitches I got, where he put them or even what type of tear I had. I had my six weeks check up Monday and when I finally get a room, I realize my doctor didn't have any notes or know anything about my delivery. She had to ask me if I got stitches and if the doctor on call gave me any information about them. I had to tell her I had no idea, I was out of it after delivering my son, I couldn't even hold him. When she finally gets to checking to make sure everything is healed up properly, her face changes and she tells me we have a problem. She  then pulls out a notepad and begins to explain that the way my vagina was stitched caused it to heal in a weird way. She then draws the opening to my vagina and shades out the middle of the hole. To put it in a better perspective, my vagina look like the number 8, but the two holes are smaller and the line in the middle is way thicker. I have two mini holes that not even a pen tip could fit into! She tells me I have to have surgery because the problem isn't going to resolve itself. I already had a traumatic time healing from the birthing process and I now have to go back through what traumatized me to begin with. Would I be able to sue the doctor? I tried researching if this is a common thing (even though I've never heard of it) but nothing pops up other than ""the husband stitch"".

Edit: I forgot to mention my doctor took a picture on my phone so I could better understand what she was trying to tell me after I didn't really understand her drawing. I don't think I can post it, not that I really want to, but if I need to draw exactly what's wrong with it to get a better answer, please let me know!

Edit: I came here to look for advice and most of you have been really nice and helpful, even the comments I haven't gotten a chance to respond too yet, but I also see some comments that are very ignorant to the female anatomy! I had someone go to another post of mine and tell me I should've been looking inside my vagina more than once in 6 weeks and the post was about my antidepressants. I don't know about any other woman but even before I had my baby I didn't just go looking inside myself very often. I've been called a troll and honestly it doesn't bother me that much but if you want to see the picture just ask, I can understand how this would be hard to believe, but I literally stated I have proof! I just want help, I'm going through a hard enough time as is."
147,My sisters 9year old friend took nude photos of my sister and distributed them on snapchat to adult men. NSFW,"We are in Pennsylvania. 

My sister(9) had nude and semi nude pictures taken of her by her friend (9). This friend had distributed them to the school students and old men on snapchat. 

We have pictures of the conversations between the girl and the old men. Where they talk about my sisters boobs and vagina. They talk about kissing naked among other things. It makes my mother and I physically sick. This girl has sent out messages to this guy pretending to be my sister. 

The mother of the girl deleted the pictures but as everyone knows once it's on the internet it's out there forever. I know that the police would be able to retrieve the photos. 

We took everything to the state police because we have her friends phone currently that has all of the messages. And the police said ""give the phone back and everything will eventually be erased from the internet."" They aren't willing to persu the GROWN MAN that is in possession of these pictures or the girl who has done all of this. They are sending us to our local police department and I know from experience when I was sexually assaulted that they will say the same thing or victim blame.

Please this cant be what we have to live with. My sister cant just be violated at 9 years old and have no justice. What can we do??"
148,[UPDATE] Coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex’s dog euthanized. Can I help prevent this?,"[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Glad to say I’ve got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn’t working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He’s also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn’t shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they’d require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can’t be “bitten” by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don’t allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog’s owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I’d call it a win!

Thank you all for your advice and support!"
149,My School is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (GA),"I found this out about two hours ago. My  High school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

In the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; ALL STUDENTS WHO DRIVE TO SCHOOL USING A PERSONAL VEHICLE MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THE KEY OR KEY FOB.

After I read this I thought it was a misprint or a mistake. So I called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

About 30 minutes later I checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. They went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

&#x200B;

I personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can I do to stop this?

Edit: Campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

Update: The school removed the policy after a car was broken into using the keys from the office. Thank You all for the help"
150,I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.,"I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

This is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances I worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

I am currently residing in Wisconsin.

I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**Information:**
My very first inkling something was up, is the day I believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when I picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. And they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

After this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

That night I had picked him up, I changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. This is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or “washes his hands” with the baby wipes. This time he was not himself. He was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. As I took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, “No! No no [Friends boyfriends name]!” And began crying hysterically. 

My heart sank. As a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. I know something was done to my baby. 

I looked my friends boyfriend’s criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. This man is dangerous, and I didn’t even know this.

**My Concerns And What Can I do?:**

Notably in Wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does CPS investigate the person reporting? Both myself and the party involve?

Will the investigators / CPS take this matter seriously when regarding my child’s age?

How do I go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

What kind of things will they (either CPS or law enforcement etc) look into?

If reported, and nothing happens, what things can I do to protect my child(ren) And my family? 

For a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs I can keep my eyes open for?

Any advice, any help at all will greatly help. I’m absolutely devastated and need help as I’m at a loss.

**Edit:** I need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why I’m scared for myself and my family.

**Edit 2**: I am currently on my way to my appointment with CPS and Law Enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases I will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, I honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome."
151,Door dash added my business to their website without my consent and failed to mention it to me,"I have a small but somewhat successful take away business in Australia that does pick up and delivery. 
For the passed month or so door dash drivers have been coming into my shop and picking up food for customers. We finally picked up on it and I called door dash and to my surprise my menu ( which was incorrect, with food and prices ) were on there. I asked them how this happened and to take me down. 


They told me it was done automatically. They never asked me or informed me. I told them to take me down immediately. They said okay.


About a week passes and I'm still getting door dashers. More and more frequently. I call them again and this time they try to argue with me saying that they are doing me a favour, insisting I stay with them. I explain I am losing money with them because instead of people paying me a delivery fee for my own drivers to deliver the food. They are paying door dash instead.

They tried to plead me to stay. I said no and even now I'm only temporarily removed from their website ( 2 weeks )

Am I entitled to compensation here or anything? I feel like I've been wronged. I don't want another business making money off my success."
152,Adopted a dog from a rescue. Now one of the staff is threatening to confiscate my dog if I don't add her on Facebook.,"**Regarding the false sticky edit by a mod: When you adopt a dog from a rescue, the dog is spayed or neutered by the rescue before they go to their forever home, as they absolutely should be. I am not planning to violate my contract by breeding my dog. I don't know who I was reported to be to the mods, but that is 100% incorrect and it's baffling that they would make that accusation without any proof. I am just someone who adopted a dog and am now being bombarded with emails (and texts now too!) from a crazy rescue owner demanding I add her on Facebook. That's it. People can stop with the harassment, threats, and insults now.**

Pretty much the title. My fiance and I adopted a dog from a rescue a couple weeks ago. Then I received a Facebook friend request the evening after doggo came home from the lady who had been fostering him. She also happens to be one of the co-founders of the rescue. I have very few friends on Facebook (literally just 28 people) because I only want to share my life with good friends and family, basically just people I trust, so I didn't accept the request. I didn't actually take any action at all, I just ignored it. A few days later, I received an email from her ""reminding"" me to accept her request and that I need to post a photo of my dog weekly so that she knows the dog is doing well and is still with me. I told her I wasn't comfortable with adding her on Facebook since I didn't really know her, but would be happy to send her periodic updates.

Apparently, this wasn't good enough, and she responded with an incredibly snooty email saying that she requires social media contact in order to be able to assess how the dogs are doing and make sure they are in a good home and that adopters are adhering to the contract. She also said that if I refuse to accept her friend request, she may have to take ""legal action"" and have our dog forcibly removed from our home.

NOWHERE in the contract does it state that I must be Facebook friends with her, and when I asked my friend who recommended this rescue if she had to do this, she said she didn't, but that this person is kind of known to be very involved and protective of the dogs she adopts out. Do I have to actually do this, and can the rescue actually take my dog back if I don't? I'm even more uncomfortable with the idea now knowing how overbearing she is. It's just a boundary thing to me."
153,(UT) A deputy showed up at our door yesterday and attempted to arrest my wife only based on her name,"The deputy knocked on the door, my wife answered.  They asked her name, she told them, and they asked her to step outside.  She declined because she wasn't wearing shoes.  He said ""OK, we will do this inside then"", and stepped in the door.  He told her that he was there to arrest her.  She's never even had so much as a parking ticket in her life.  She protested that she had done nothing wrong, and that she had a common name.  Finally they agreed to let her get her ID.  After examining it, they went and looked up the birthday of their suspect and found that they were indeed different, so they left.

I'm upset that this happened.  If she had stepped outside, they would have likely arrested her on the spot, she did not have her phone, and I would have had no idea what had happened to her.  I would like to file whatever complaints I can, and ideally find the judge who signed the warrant to complain how poorly the deputies did in trying to arrest the correct person.  Any advice for the best next steps?"
154,"Neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the TWO spaces in front of our home. After asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving ALL their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.","California here, getting that out of the way. And full disclosure, its not my home. The home belongs to my parents, but I house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus I love my parents and want what's best for them). I will just be saying MY home or MY driveway so I dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


These neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with ALL the memories. I thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

My parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. He has it parked in the middle so that it takes up ALL the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. It has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. Why? I don't know. Perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. All I know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

I want to also mention they have a full garage. They also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. And a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

I politely asked him to move his car when I saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. He followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. Several days later I visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

I spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since I had asked him to move his car as payback. They said he's really mean and to just let it go. This did not sit right to me, so I later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. I explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

Bad idea. I assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. I assumed mom would just tell 'Billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. Turns out he got it from mom and dad. I get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how I did NOT just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

I didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. My mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. Apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an FU to my mom and dad. That's also when their car got keyed

So since I made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. Now the parents are retaliating too.They finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. The one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. The beater was moved so its parked on the OTHER side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. Sorry for the run-on sentence. Did that all make sense? I hope so.

This has been going on for a few weeks now.

Is there anything that can be done? My parent's just seem to want to let it go. Not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. My parents travel a lot and my work makes it so I cant always be there to sit the house for them. They fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. I used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. Is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


TLDR - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. The neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. Parents fear retaliation."
155,"Two large pitbulls got loose from their owner’s grip and attacked my dog unprovoked. This is the second time it has happened with those same dogs. She is refusing to pay vet bills this time because “I shouldn’t have been walking my dog around her apartment.” Houston, TX","The first time I let it go because she paid the vet bills and my dog got the care she needed. She is a medium sized, 35lb dog.   
This time, I turned a corner with my dog and her dogs saw mine, overpowered her (walking both at once. About 60-80lb pitbulls) and even though I picked my dog up, they bit her leg and dragged her down before going for her neck. I screamed for help and eventually people came out to help.   

One bystander said I “should avoid that area because I know her dogs live there.” And I guess they convinced that owner that it was MY fault that her dogs attacked my dog.   

My dog has a reputation around the complex for barking and trying to intimidate people, but I keep her in check and hold a short leash because of that. My dog has never attacked anyone or anything and has never gotten out of my control because I know how to handle her. This lady said that “my dog is known to provoke reactions” and is using that to justify why her dogs attacked mine.  

I’ve already called animal control and I am about to file a complaint to the property manager. What else should I do?

I will be following some of the advice recieved and update once I have one.

That has been expecially helpful because it’s put my situation into perspective. Yeah it sucks but worst case I can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn’t the case for people within the community. And even though the NYPD has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. Hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i’ve Found myself in for what it is. Will update when I can.**


*Edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home SEVEN times. and this is common.*

I live in Brooklyn NY. I purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by Orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by Orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. I honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

Since i moved in though, this has been a HUGE issue. I don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. I honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. The issue is that they have been using the Jewish police to harass me. 
To give you an idea of the shit I am dealing with I'll tell you what prompted this post.  I chose to have a Superbowl viewing party today. About 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were FIVE people here) I get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. We were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). My condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   Since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people I INVITED from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. I don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that I have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

I am fucking done. I want this to stop. I have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. I have tried calling the NYPD every time they show up. This has not worked. I have complained to my condo association. No help. I have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city AND state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and NOTHING has worked. I keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home THAT I OWN WITH MY PERMISSION. 

Im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. I am just so fed up with this bullshit. I am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a HOME I OWN on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

am i crazy here? how is this allowed? what can i do to stop it? "
157,I (27F) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work,"Hello,

As the post says I am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **Virginia**. I work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. When I was hired I wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. I think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that I'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. I have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. So then I had to buy a wireless mouse. I have a nice computer and I hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200B;

Today I have strep. Strep as an adult is terrible. I told my boss I could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. That night on the phone she said yes please work from home. First thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. She said OK, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since I wouldn't install the timer and that I was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

&#x200B;

This is on top of the fact that I have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. Yes, I have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. During the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

&#x200B;

So listen, I know I need a new job but- is this legal? How do I approach this? I am now going to have to use sick/vacation time that I wasn't planning on using. I think I should be paid for my time today.

158,Update: Ex-Wife has custody and wants me to allow her new husband to adopt our son. Do I have to do this?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5cku3a/tx_wife_has_custody_and_wants_me_to_allow_her_new/

Thanks for the help!

She ended up taking me to court. Her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before I even met her, and she married me knowing it). Her lawyer claimed otherwise, that I had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. This was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as I had email communications with her acknowledging my record. She insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. Perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. Her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

She dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

Her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. He was a decent guy. Ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. It's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

I'm talking to my lawyer to change the custody agreement too.  "

He’s being completely irrational and doesn’t want me to have anything. Not the furniture in the house, the food in the fridge, or our dog. I’m hoping someone can help me out with the most important things below: 

First, We don’t have a prenup. I met him when i was 19 and he had opened up his first restaurant in the city, I really thought we’d grow old together. I know, stupid of me not to cover my ass but i was with him for so long that i got really comfortable and couldn’t imagine him doing this. We bought a condo in New York and most of it was paid for by me and my family but it is in his name. I’m scared of losing the house since my parents and I put so much into it. But, I also can’t afford to keep the house on my own for more than a few months unless I ask my parents for help which I’m also embarrassed to ask for. Can his infidelity help me out here? 

Second, he bought me a car for my birthday just last year and is telling me i have to leave the car with him- so i have no way of moving any of my stuff out and would put myself at great risk of getting covid-19. Is he allowed to do this?

Third, I am a co-signer on two of the small loans that he has on his restaurants. I’m also invested in them and they’re a great second source of income, even in these times. How will the judge (or whoever ultimately makes the decision) determine whether or not I can maybe keep one of the restaurants or still collect revenue from them? Again, no prenup and my husband was unfaithful. 

I’d love to hear your advice. Any bit helps right now."
160,My family is abusive and I want to emancipate myself,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My maternal grandfather also stays with us. My parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - I was in the car but I survived - and I was taken in by my maternal aunt. My dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

The last two years have been hell for me. Not only because I still can't get over losing my parents (I cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. My mom was actually estranged from her family. She was white, and my dad was black. Her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. They have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and I guess I'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

They have told me just that on several occasions. That my existence is a mistake. I get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. And I'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Sometimes it gets physical. Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a minefield. I have to be so careful about where I step cause the repercussions may be explosive. My ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. He has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

I can't live like this anymore. I'm an absolute emotional mess. I wanna emancipate myself but I don't know how to go about it. I know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 I'm close with a set of twins at school - I'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. Their parents own a farm and I work regularly with the family. I'm also into photography and I've been doing real good with shooting weddings. They are very lucrative and I've saved up a substantial amount. With summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but I also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

The parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. I've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. I don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

I would really appreciate advice.

Thank you

161,"Girlfriend drank from water fountain at airport, was told 15 minutes later that all water was highly contaminated.","My girlfriend and I were coming home from a trip abroad and had just gone through customs in Houston. On our way to the next gate we decided to use the restroom, she waited for me as I went in. As I came out, she was just finishing a presumably long drink of water from the fountain. On our way to the gate we stopped at one of the restaurants, and ordered food. After asking for water, we were told that the airport water system had been contaminated 2 days prior, and that they were not allowed to serve us water. Not from machines, or sinks, or anything. My girlfriend remarked on the water that she had drank, and they just ignored it and got us different drinks. My girlfriend is now extremely sick, with very similar systems to food poisoning. Is there any grounds to stand on as there was no written warnings in the airport ?"

I'm a Greek national, the captain's russian, and the ship's registry is Marshall islands and the incidents happened in international waters.

Thank you so much.


UPDATE: Thank you all SO SO MUCH for your warm support and advice, I really needed this. I was skeptical, even hesitant in the beginning but this turns out to be the very best choice I have made in a few weeks. I am literally sobbing while on duty and I am so grateful.

I decided to first contact the Greek Consulate on the matter as per your advice. I will also checkout all the links you have posted. Please keep me in your prayers and I hope this really works out.

165,Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp,"My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I’ve done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. My front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn’t very visible from the street. I painted it to match the house as well.

Few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife’s never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which I chalked up to her being shy or whatever. However, recently I got a note taped up to my door that said she’s going to sue if I don’t take the ramp down, as it’s an eyesore and “reduces curbside value.” I have no idea what she means since you can’t see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

She refused to answer the door when I went over to talk to her about it. I’m trying not to lose my temper over this but it’s hard. There’s been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called “handicap accessible” places, I don’t want my home to be one of them. Does she have any sort of case? I’m in Washington."
166,[UPDATE] Local businessowner attacks women with power drill to groin. How is this not a crime?,"Idk if anyone would care about this, but I wanted to post an update anyways because it's good news. Original post was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9stxzx/a_local_business_owner_attacked_a_woman_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This happened in Wisconsin.  

Basically, almost 2 years ago, my family member was attacked with a power drill by a bar owner. He was trying to flirt with her (she was not interested) and then ""jokingly"" thrust a running power drill into her genital area. She pushed his hand away, and so he drilled through her jeans into her inner thigh instead. Instead of immediately stopping, he continued drilling and the drill bit penetrated her jeans, penetrated her skin, and also burned her badly enough to require treatment from the burn clinic, and caused nerve damage. She got an infection from the wound as well.  (Pics are on the old post)  The nurses at the hopsital had encouraged her to report the incident to police, and she did the next day, especially because there were *numerous* witnesses present for this entire incident who were horrified and wanted to make a statement.  

The police officer who responded seemed indifferent and even hostile towards her reporting this right off the bat, and he refused to see the wound or even a picture of it. He wasn't willing to speak to any witnesses. He did go and speak with the bar owner, who admitted to doing all of this, and claimed it was ""an accident"", and that he would pay her medical bills. (Spoiler alert: He did not.)  The officer deemed this answer satisfactory, and went back to tell my cousin that ""because alcohol was involved"" (owner was sober, she had 1 drink, no one was intoxicated?), that nothing could be done and that she was banned from the bar for life. That was the end of that, or so we thought....   

Now for the update:  Out of the blue in early 2020, my cousin gets a phone call from an FBI agent. I don't know how this works, but apparently our local PD has an FBI agent who comes in a couple days a week and works on or reviews stuff? Anyways, the bar owner was being investigated for separate, unrelated sex crimes, and the FBI agent came across the report my cousin had made against him. She asked my cousin what had happened, and she told her. The agent was shocked and appalled, she said because NONE OF THAT was in the officers police report. Nothing whatsoever about this guy taking a power drill to her groin. She told the FBI lady that she had very thorough documentation, pictures, and medical records from this incident, as well as a dozen witnesses, and the agent had her send it all to her and set up a meeting the following week to discuss.    

When they sat down the following week, she told her that what had happened to her was most definitely a crime, possibly even a sex crime. The witnesses confirmed her account, and were willing to testify in court. The officer who had blown her off was reprimanded and disciplined for his inaction, and tried to defend himself by claiming, ""I didn't know her wound was that bad"", to which the FBI agent asked him, ""Why did you refuse to look at her wound or pictures of it?"" Anyways, the FBI lady took this case to the district attorney, who agreed to file charges.  

The bar owner has since been arrested and charged with the following:  

2nd Degree Reckless Injury - Felony.    

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

Disorderly Conduct- Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.   

4th Degree Sexual Assault - Misdemeanor.  

Stalking - Felony.  

His tavern license was revoked, his bar was shut down, and has since been sold. The case is delayed due to COVID, but they did arrest and charge him finally. This guy also sexually assaulted other women, both before and after this incident (he has prior disorderly conduct convictions and many restraining orders from women against him). These other charges include ""allegedly"" cornering a female bartender and demanding she give him oral sex--at which point she just ran screaming out of the place. He also violently cornered and groped another female bartender, and then stalked her mercilessly, smashed out her windows, slashed her tires, etc., until he was finally caught on video stalking her.   

It never sat well with me that the police blew this off, especially knowing his prior history, and hearing stories about him abusing other women. Obviously, this guy was escalating, probably because he never faced consequences for his actions before.  I'm glad to say he will finally face justice for his crimes, thanks to the actions of this FBI agent."
167,"My neighbors received a typed letter in a handwritten envelope through the post. The letter claimed that my wife and I are growing drugs, long time drug users and host bisexual swinger parties. My employer lives on my street and surely received this letter... My wife is a real estate agent.","Orlando, Florida. 

Fortunately, one of my neighbors shared the typed letter and hand written envelope with me. Other neighbors called my wife to tell her. The envelope was written in a way clearly trying to obfuscate their handwriting but a trained eye (i work in corporate Fraud) can find plenty of patterns of their actual handwriting.  I plan to file a police report today after work.

What else should i do?  My wife is a real estate agent and the head of my company's local office is one of my neighbors.  This is all lies but could hurt both of our careers and we have a teenage daughter (she saw the letter).

****UPDATE****
Wow front page! I want to just thank everyone who's been extremely positive and encouraging and providing great advice in the comments and direct messages. I have some good avenues to explore but likely I think the culprit might be an ex-employee of mine or a neighbor with mental illness. With that said, the neighborhood has been rallying behind us. My wife and I have received multiple phone calls from neighbors expressing support.  We've collected everyone's letter and envelope on our street (except for one because they're on vacation) for when we file our police report.   I have a copy of letter that I wish I could share but this sub does not allow images but I did try and Google the wording and it seems unique for those of you that are asking if it's a template.  I will definitely be careful and cautious in the future and keep my home security cameras on just in case."
168,My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"".

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but I didn't know what else to do. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn't even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

Thanks in advance :)

&#x200B;

EDIT:  He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like I'm gonna propose"" (that one was last April)

169,Bank gave away my entire banking account,"So last week, a check I wrote bounced from an account I have that I rarely use. It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case. 

Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.

So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?"
170,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP."

173,"Girlfriend's work ""lost"" her sexual harassment report, then tells her it's over and she's also being written up for work deficiencies.","This happened in California.

My girlfriend recently filed a sexual harassment report with her company after repeated inappropriate conversations, unwanted pictures, touching and hugging and all around creepy behavior that makes her uncomfortable by some of the males at her job. Upon asking one of her supervisors how to submit the report she and another girl who had similar issues were immediately taken to HR. She filed the report and chose to remain anonymous on all the HR paperwork. A few days down the road she is told by HR that both reports have gone missing and they think it was another supervisor that has misplaced it. This supervisor is a different one than the one that had taken her to HR and in my opinion, should have had nothing to do with handling her reports. After being told that HR lost the report, the HR lady then goes on to say that she will talk to the specific guys at work and will tell them specifically that they aren't allowed to retaliate against my girlfriend. Even though it was against her wishes to disclose her name to everyone, the HR lady seemed to be going to do it anyway.

It's now about a week later after everyone has been particularly bitter and mean to her throughout the week for no apparent reason. The head supervisor for her department comes down and says they need to talk. In the meeting is my girlfriend, the head supervisor, another supervisor, and HR. The head supervisor is the only one that talks and starts off with ""That (NAME REMOVED) crap is done and cleared, it's over now"" then continues into how my girlfriends work ethic, conduct, and paperwork has all been messed up since she got there and that they were going to write her up. She has never received any negative paperwork from the company and has only gotten an ass-chewing when she was late due to circumstances out of her control. The supervisor is pointing out things that have never been brought to her attention as to being erroneous and is now using it as a tool to write her up.

Naturally, she feels confused and angry about the whole situation. From other supervisors having hands on her report to losing her report and getting written up for bullshit. Part of the things she was being written up for she had nothing to do with.

What are her options here?  From what I've been able to find, she can submit a complaint through the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

Any help is appreciated.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

First off. Thank you for the support, she will be contacting a lawyer to get their opinion on it and to pursue the next course of action.

She has voice recordings of the inappropriate things these guys were saying and asking her as well as an email she sent to HR asking the lady to not reveal her identity.

What would be the hard documentation she would need in order to fight this? Her employers have already disappeared the report so it's her word against theirs whether or not she filed one."
174,[Update] Husband is physically abusive. He is a cop. I can't escape. Help?,"[previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/tp9en2/husband_is_physically_abusive_he_is_a_cop_i_cant/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Hello all,

First of all... I am alive!

Second of all... thank you all so much. 

In my first post I was really really scared because I thought my husband might kill me.

I'm glad to say I made it out.

After the threat I got new motivation and energy to go out. I made a little emergency bag and hid it in the laundry room under the dirty pile.

I started keeping petty cash from my shopping trips.

With the petty cash I bought a very cheap pre paid phone that I used to call a woman's shelter.
They helped me make a plan and got me out of there. 

That was by far the scariest night of my life. I left when I knew my husband had night shift. I was so scared that he somehow found out what I was planning and was hiding out to catch me.

I had been very careful too. I was sweet to him. Acted as if he had broken me successfully. Acted on his every wish. It was very painful.

But that night at 3 am I finally escaped with my little bag. I left behind my phone. That same day I had sold my laptop. I told my husband that I wanted to put some cash forward to his gaming PC so he wouldn't mind. 

I got an old tablet with Sim function for very cheap too. So that I had the rest of the 500 bucks of my laptop sale for me.

I left the car behind and everything left the house and just ran till I arrived at a McDonald's and from there ordered an Uber to the pick up place. 

As soon as I arrived they helped me close everything that could be closed (email, cashapp, my bank account etc etc). And they helped me get an amazing lawyer.

So right now I am in the shelter alive and well. I finally managed to get a TRO till the divorce hearing. My lawyer is realistic with the case.

But everything that matters is that I am no longer scared of going to sleep at night and never waking up.


Thank you so much!"
175,"OBGYN will not stop calling my dad to confirm appointments, even though I'm 22 (","(using a throwaway in case my dad reddits, would prefer him not to find my account)

In Indiana

I'm in grad school, but still go to the same OBGYN in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. I was planning to switch once I finished school and settled down. I have him listed as my emergency contact. 

For some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. Things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(My father and I have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. I will also be switching docs ASAP)

This has to be a HIPAA violation, right? I can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. This could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse. 

tl;dr obgyn keeps calling emergency contact for appointment confirmation instead of my personal number. Worried it could get someone in a more vulnerable than me hurt"
176,[NC] My dog went missing a month ago and i found her on Facebook. The family that has her refuses to return her to me. What can I do?,"So a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. At first I thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. I made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

Last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. It was my dog. I should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

I called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. I told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation I all but confirmed it. Here's the problem, when I asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. Stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because I took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". I told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

I found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. I found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. She is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

I'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. That dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. What can I do? I have all of the papers that prove I own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. I also have that police report. What do I need to do to get my dog back?"
177,Creepy neighbor thinks he’s my new bf,"I am a mid 20s female. I bought a house with my ex-boyfriend out in the sticks of Kentucky about a year ago. Not terribly long ago, he cheated on me and abandoned our home to be with his new girlfriend. So, I own this property and live here by myself. One of the people that lives at the house (multi-generation home) across the pond is a 21 year old male. He has been watching my house and saw that my ex isn’t here much anymore. So he comes down about 4 days ago and we’re having a regular old friendly neighbor conversation about the Guinea Keets I was getting for him. Then he gets creepy.


I made the mistake of telling him my ex and I broke up, and he instantly started asking very personal questions. He asked to take me to the movies, if he could come over and watch a movie, to go fishing, to go shooting, to hang out. I said “no” to all of these, explaining first, that I am not interested in dating or hanging out, that he’s my damn neighbor and that’s weird and that I’m “seeing people”. 


He continues to insist. I tell him flat out “no” and that I can be his neighbor and that’s it; make an excuse to go inside. I go to a friend’s house for a few days and notice he drives past my house 10+ times in a 2 hour span on my security camera, every night.


I keep my doors closed and locked. Yesterday he decides that no mean yes and comes to my door asking to come inside, that he just wants to talk about the guineas and that he has a Rambo dvd for us to watch. I only have the door cracked a bit and tell him 5+ times that I am in the middle of something, that I’m busy and that he needs to leave. I’m pissed, so the final time he tries to insist, I slam the door on him and lock it. 


Any legal advice for this? What would you do? So far, I know I am going to be video recording any interactions he attempts with me from now on and keeping my gun loaded/close by, but I know trespassing is a sticky law, even in KY. I don’t have no trespassing signs up at the moment. I am also putting my house on the market this Saturday because I’m just done and want a fresh start considering everything that’s going on in my life rn, but I will be at the house a lot while it’s on the market."
178,"Boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, I was not raped.","I am in Boston BUT my abortion happened in New York City. I was 18 and this was completely legal. 

I’m 18 and in college. Like all 18 year olds, I mess up. I messed up big time and I ended up pregnant. I waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, I went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and I took a couples’ trip to NYC so I could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

We got back to Boston and life went on. I am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, I’m not considered depressed, I have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. I receive my therapy in a non religious environment. This is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before I went to college, my parents are toxic, and I needed help with that burden. 

I told my therapist immediately that I’d had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, I go to a university that I worked my ass off to get into and I’ll be damned if I let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. I also could not raise a child that I disdained. Selfish? Yes. But I’m not sorry). I also informed her that my boyfriend and I are still together and that he and I plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. He and I split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

I go home and do homework. At around 4 pm, I get a visit from the Boston Police who are investigating a rape. They think that I’m the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that I’ve been forced to have an abortion, I ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and I agreed that abortion was the way to go. After a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

Then I get a call from my parents. They’re ranting on and on about how I’ve gotten an abortion and sinned in God’s eyes, how I’ve been fornicating and screwed every man in NYC, and how my lack of contact (I’m NC with them because of abuse and they’re narcissists) is killing my mother. They screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they’ve been given my address in Boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

It becomes clear. My therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (I never gave her their number, address, or personal information. She did not know their names, I only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that I’d been raped and gotten an abortion. 

I never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. I never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when I mentioned the sex, I called it “consensual sex”. The police are still hounding me, I’m freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by CONTINUING to knowingly provide false information to the police (although I gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that I have Stockholm Syndrome and that’s why I won’t report my boyfriend, and I’m at a loss for what to do. 

I also know why she’s having some weird witch hunt. My boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, I was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). I was not and in the session I said specifically told her that I never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that I was raped at his fraternity house. 

I’ve also started to get calls from the NYPD investigating the “forced abortion” and I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. This is serious. 

At this point in time I know that I need to get the police off my butt. Is there a way that would help me? Is a lawyer the best way to go? Also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? Is there a way to make sure she doesn’t do this again? 


Edit: when the cops came the first time, I told them that she was completely falsifying everything and I gave them evidence. She is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so I’m not taken seriously. The last time the cops called was last night. "

180,"One of my relatives is ""Homeschooling"" her kids, but isn't actually teaching them anything. Her oldest is 2 years behind now. Nearly 8 years old. Is there anything I can do in Texas to report her? I heard Texas has pretty lax homeschooling rules.","By 2 years behind, I mean that she has admitted to not teaching the kid. She has stated herself that if she were to put the kid in school they'd have to start 2 grades behind. There are other things in their life that support this. But I don't exactly want to give out too many details. My question is simply that if I suspect she is neglecting her child's education what steps could I take? I don't care about your opinions on right and wrong. If I have legal steps to take then I will. If not, then I won't. That simple. Having interacted with the kid and other kids that age, the kid is behind in so many ways. And no, their mom isn't teaching some odd curriculum. She just straight up isn't teaching her kids. She is like a very hands off day care for her own kids.

No she isn't doing what ever that unschooling stuff is. She just isn't teaching. She says she doesn't have the time. She is a stay home mom."
181,My rapist sent me an Instagram DM confessing to raping me 7 years later. The prosecutor still refuses to press charges. What can I do?,"For the sake of anonymity, i am going to keep this long story short. I was raped in college by a man i did not know and did not ever express interest in. He followed me home from a bar and snuck into my building and waited until my male friend who walked me home that night (to get away from him) left my building to come bang on my door. At the time I was an 18 yr old white female and this was a smallish college town in the south. 

I had a lot more evidence than typical campus rape cases (witnesses/text messages/rape kit) and this was not the type of guy that made one horrible mistake - if nothing happened i knew he would 10000% do it to another girl which is why i felt it was my responsibility to try to do something. 

By the time the DA finally officially told me they weren’t going to do anything 2 years later, because “it’s difficult to prosecute when alcohol is involved”, it was too late for me to pursue a civil suit. It might be worth noting that the man comes from money, and a lot of it.  I also found out they never analyzed my rape kit, let alone investigated the crime scene. There were few other things that were pretty sketchy about the police investigation /DAs handling of the case, but I can’t get too specific on here. It kind of felt like they were doing everything in their power to not prosecute, and there’s literally nothing on his record to show for it, not even a dropped charge.

It took me a long time to truly move on and accept that I did what I could, but i finally did. And then a week or so ago, 6 1/2 years later, I realized I had unread message requests on Instagram from a month prior and saw I had something from him (we were not Instagram friends). There were various messages in a row that clearly demonstrate he is not well mentally, but more importantly at the end he said “so I guess i raped you.  I won’t do it to anyone else ever”. I was shook. 

I sent it to the DAs office, who were utterly shocked and the next day said they’d get back to me in another week but that I “shouldn’t get my hopes up because this kind of stuff is really complicated and difficult to prosecute”. While they haven’t told me officially yet that they aren’t going to prosecute, I know in my gut it’s not going to happen. They’ll find an excuse. 

So i know i need a lawyer so please don’t give that to me as advice. I am posting this question to see if anyone’s ever been through anything similar and knows of nonprofits/resources/pro bono lawyers that might be able to help. I can’t sue him (statute limitations) and I can’t really sue the government (uphill battle), but I also can’t just let this go again. If there’s anything I’ve learned recently It’s that things/systems don’t change by staying quiet. 

What can i do to both get a mark on his record and shed light on the justice system that failed me and I’m sure many others?

Edit - I received so much helpful advice, referrals, and positive comments and I can’t thank you all enough. I now have a lawyer who specializes in these kind of cases, and is going to try to help me push the criminal case through the legal system. If that doesn’t work, plan B will be to publish my experience on media/social media. Thanks again!"
182,[IL] Neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). Landlord hasn’t done anything,"I rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex’s parking lot is included in my rent. I have a parking pass that I display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

I have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. I have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. I have also kept a log of every time I notice this neighbor in my spot & when I’ve contacted my landlord. (For what it’s worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he’s gone to reserve it, so I don’t think this is just confusion - I don’t think he owns a spot at all).

This past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. I confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. I once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, I shouldn’t have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

Well, apparently neighbor didn’t listen, because last night he was in my spot again. I called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn’t come or were talked out of it by him, because when I woke up this morning, his car was still there.

Additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an HOA, & my landlord always claims he’ll “notify them” when I make a complaint about my neighbor. 

I’m growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as I pay for this spot. With that being said, I’d appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. What can I do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. What actions can I take to ensure my neighbor doesn’t get me towed from a spot that I am authorized to use?

Update edit: I just spoke with the HOA. They confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn’t even have a parking spot at all. HOA also said he should’ve never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won’t happen again. Finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that I can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot. "

184,I'm going to sound like a busybody but am concerned with my coworker and her boyfriend sleeping naked with her breast-fed seven-year-old; now she's getting ready to pull her out of public school because her teacher is questioning why the girl is smart but acts like a much younger child.,"This coworker of mine is beautiful and very popular, but in my opinion is taking this hippie thing entirely too far. Her daughter is smart enough but constantly reverting to acting like a toddler; she's doing it more than she acts her age. I support extended breast feeding but this is getting weird. We work at a health food store; we are talking major crunchy granola.  So, once she let it slip that they all sleep naked in bed together. I honestly do not think they are pedophiles at all, but as liberal as I am, that's still getting weird at her age.  I've always minded my own business, but now she's saying she's going to pull the girl out of the public school because the classroom teacher is starting to question the emotional development of the child. Do I mind my own business or make a discreet phone call to CPS?  No way in Hell would I discuss the matter with her; she's on one hell of an ego trip.  Could I do this anonymously? I can't risk CPS telling her it was me. One last detail: another coworker's daughter spent the night at their house and they had both girls running around naked, which would not have been cool with the girl's conservative mom, but the adults were not naked in front of the girls. # Free Spirit!"
185,"Grandmother with dementia charged $13,000 USD for clothes at strip mall in Florida","My grandmother who is 91 with severe dementia was charged $13,000 for five pieces of clothes at a strip mall in West Palm Beach, Florida. We have limited the amount of money she can spend (she wrote checks for the clothes) and so the checks bounced. I have contacted the store owners who sent a 'receipt' for her purchases which is hand written on a piece of paper (no store business information) and just says 'dress $4000' and 'skirt $3000', etc. 

&#x200B;

I strongly suspect that the owner just made up these prices (that normally they would be sold for MUCH less) and my grandmother was incapably of discerning any of this. My grandmother can't drive and has a full-time caregiver who was with her (and did nothing to stop this).  The owner is now asking me to pay what is 'owed' on the clothes.

186,My sister is in some weird cult - MI,"No, that is not clickbait and I am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

Okay. So my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. She came across a Craigslist posting by a woman I'll refer to as Aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. I never saw the ad, but I remember my sister telling me about it at the time. She was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. So she began a correspondence with ""Aileen"". I did not live with my sister, I'm older by 5 years so I was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

So she ends up going to this place last August, I think, maybe early September. I have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. I was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""Aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. That right there was the first time I thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so I didn't push it.

Over time, the tone of her emails changed. She would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""Aileen"" much. Then it gradually became that ""Aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""Aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""Aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""Aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""Aileen"" made her take drugs. Seriously disturbing stuff. I told her she needed to get out of there, that I'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""Aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

I didn't know what to do at that point. I thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and I trusted her judgment at the time. It's not like I had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, I didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""Aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. Yes, I was tentatively concerned, is what I'm trying to say, but I felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

My sister emailed me yesterday and I don't feel like that is the case anymore. Something had happened and from what I was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""Aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. My sister was forced to participate in this. She seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. I don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

I stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but I couldn't figure anything out. I know my sister took a Greyhound to Lansing and Aileen picked her up from the bus station, so I think this freak show is probably in either Eaton, or Ingham but as to more specifics, I have no idea. I don't think my sister even knows. I have a hunch they're in, or around Mason because Aileen made the kids spend the night at Seven Gables, but other than that I'm coming up empty.

I know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but I really need to know what to do. How do I handle this situation?  

Good update: I did what a lot of people suggested with the IP address. I would have never thought of it, I'm not very tech savvy. She is in Mason or at least uses that library. I'm going to contact the police there. You guys are rockstars."

189,"Have been sick for 18 months. Found out through a 2nd Dr. opinion, the day before Christmas, that that my first hospital/doctor likely misdiagnosed my condition. New doctor says says surgery is now no longer an option, and was told to get my affairs in order. What can I do?","It’s three in the morning here. Haven’t slept much in 4 days. Apologies if I’m unable to separate my emotions with objectivity. 

I’m (44M) a husband to my wife (40F) and a father to two children under 18. 

In June of 2018 I began having small seizures and went to see my PCP who referred me to my hospitals Nerology clinic. The clinic ran bloodwork, did a spinal MRI, and a 60 minute EEG. Concluded that my seizures were psychogenic. For the next year+ the seizers grew worse. I went back to the neurology clinic a dozen more times.. my wife and I practically begging for some... any... additional testing to get to the bottom of the seizures. Well documented. 

Fed up, in early December of this year I went to see another neurologist / hospital for a second opinion. I’ve was in the hospital for weeks where they ran much more extensive testing including a complete brain / spinal MRI, brain CT, Lumbar Puncture, and other more exhaustive EEG tests. 

On December 23rd, my last day in the hospital, my “second opinion” neurologist and neurosurgeon told my wife and I that I have an tumor that likely spread from a misdiagnosed growth in my right front parietal lobe... which has spread to the base of my brain stem. The right frontal tumor is operable, but the cancer in the base of my brain stem is not. 

The 2nd doctor(s) dont seem to want to throw the other hospital under the bus, but it’s obvious (at least to my wife and I) that they think my first doctors made some pretty bad mistakes in missing some fairly obvious signs and failing to run some basic tests,

I’m sick to my stomach. I think partly because I’m scared out of my mind for both me and my family, but also at the thought that this could have been avoided. It’s likely I won’t have the strength to find out if, or how, the first hospital messed up.. I’m not sure I’ll even be around to find out let alone ask the questions.

No one thinks I should worry and stress about what “could have been done”, and to focus my energy on getting “well” whole getting my affairs in order. 

I can’t help but rage at my first doctors for, what it feels and sounds like, is a major fuck up.

Assuming that the first hospital made a mistake, where do I even start to get the legal help I need to unwind the last 18 months? What happens if I’m not around to get to the bottom of the possible mistakes the first hospital made?

Edit - Located in California as are both hospitals."

It happened February 3rd, 2018. The attack was classified as a level one trauma. I arrived to the dog park before noon with my two dogs. The dog was being aggressive towards my dog, a puppy. Before this they were dry humping each other. I went to lift my dog to prevent a situation but the pit bull turned on me. The last thing i remember is it *****. I remember me being on the ground covered in dirt and mauled for like three entire minutes. He locked on two of my limbs. Ripped my face apart, and left my dog for dead.I tried so hard to defend him and myself but this dog overpowered the both of us. I was rushed to the emergency room,  given an immediate mike of fentanyl for the road but even that couldn’t calm the pain. Which is really the only thing I can remember for the aftermath part. I almost went into cardiac arrest from rate my heart was pumping is what a nurse told me. i wasn’t aware of the extent of my injuries but i couldn’t see from my left eye.

Two weeks ago, my room mate accused me of stealing 3700$ out of his bedroom and swears up and down that it was me because he has “footage”. He also filed a restraining order. According to the police report, this theft occurred between the hours of 4 am to 5 am of August 22, 2019. However, during this time I was about an hour away from home and have receipts to prove it. I went to a 24 hour CVS and a bank that places me somewhere else. Not only that but I was at the airport at 6 am going on vacation. This was not me. I didn’t get word of what was going on until 3 days into my vacation and was told I was wanted for grand larceny and fleeing the country. As soon as I came back to New York on the 28th, I called the detective and set up a meeting. When I did meet with him, I showed him the receipts and provided him with my license plate to prove that I was not in the neighborhood the day of. He very much nonchalantly brushed me off and let me know he’ll “get around” to my case because he has more important cases to take care of. However this is literally ruining my life. I have not been home since coming back and I’ve been staying with a friend. My room mate is literally squatting in the apartment and ransacking my room. I got a call this morning that he broke into my room and is currently throwing all my possessions out of the 2nd story window. I’m a student and can’t afford a lawyer right now. I’m about to head to my apartment and I don’t know what to expect. I don’t know what to do. Any advice is appreciated."
193,[UPDATE] I have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! And my landlord’s response was: “If you don’t like it- just move out!”,"[Here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

I have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400CAD a month) in my apartment in Ontario, Canada.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the advice I received from the original post – here’s what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200B;

**I managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* I noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month I was consistently consuming around 2600 kWh. No matter the month – no matter if I was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* I also checked the specific weeks where I was on vacation. I was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- I paid around $70 for each week I was away. A total of $140 I paid when I wasn’t even home for two weeks!
* Furiously, I called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit Is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* She also Informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**The inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* I was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* The Inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* The closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! Feeding hot water to all the units.
* To prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! Meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* Also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

After emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. We noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). After he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. I had to shower at the neighbor’s house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200B;

**Yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to “see what’s going on.”** *My boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* Instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. He is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* My boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and FIX this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven’t already done enough).
* The landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said “**If you don’t like it- just move out!”**

**I am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* Due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* Since my boyfriend and I are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with NO hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**My question to all of you:**

1. What do I do now?... Can I trust my landlord to ‘solve’ this issue on his own – even though his “plumbers” will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. What happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. Do I need a lawyer?

Thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200B;

***EDIT!***

* Thank's to all of you who commented last night! - Unfortunately the comments got locked before I could even reply to any of you! 
* I am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on Monday!

194,(UPDATE} A clothing company I used to work for is sending me a cease and desist letter for using designs they rejected.,"[Orignal post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e7ohlh/a_clothing_company_i_used_to_work_for_is_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I brought this up to a lawyer and they laughed. I made the designs before I started there on my own computer on my own time. They had no legal claim to them, and they were just trying to bully/strong arm a 19 year old designer. 

My lawyer sent back some type of legal letter and they immediately apologized and said that any designs I didn’t specifically make for customers were mine and mine only. My lawyer said something along the lines of “they can’t afford this type of suit.” as they are a mom and pop type company. Lawyer did it free of charge. 

All worked out in my favor!"
195,(Update) Bought a PS4 from Walmart for Christmas and it had books in it,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

Ever since discovering right before Christmas that the PS4 Spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

I took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""We stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

Corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. So I've been back to the same Walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. I wasn't yelling, or causing issues I just want the PS4 my wife purchased for our son for Christmas. 

So the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""I believe this man has been trying to scam us since Christmas Eve claiming his PS4 had books in the box"". Cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that I've been constantly dealing with and I get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

I again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

So the outcome? No PS4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and I cannot do a chargeback. If you are ever purchasing anything expensive from Walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. Merry Christmas Walmart.

196,"[WA] My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. Is there anything I can do?","Hi, so my life is falling apart.

As the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. They have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. I love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and I would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

She has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. I don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. The reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but I know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. As a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

I was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. I opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. I told him that if he did end up having custody I would want to be seeing her as often as possible as I consider her my family. He told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. I don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that I am too as a result. I slammed the door. I was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

So basically, I have a few questions:First, Can anything be done to stop him having custody? There are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research I have completed.

Third, at the very least, could I contend in a court that I have visiting rights to her? I'm not actually related to her, so I'm not sure what the standing is there.

Third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway I can straight up adopt my step sister? I have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, I have an apartment of my own, and I would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**EDIT: I want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

Thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. I'm at my wits end and I will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and I don't care about the cost."
197,"UPDATE - [NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago. My supplier is blaming UPS, UPS is blaming me and refusing to do anything. What can i do?","My original post can be found here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/hly90t/ny_ups_dumped_around_10000_worth_of_product/) 

So after talking to a lawyer, he wrote a strongly worded letter to my supplier basically outlining that they are responsible for losses incurred during shipping (FOB Shipping). My supplier has changed their tune drastically after that letter and refunded me. Unfortunately they have decided to no longer do business with me anymore, which hurts a lot. 

UPS however is still a complete and utter mess, but someone told me to send it to a local UPS store via ups my choice, which actually worked for some packages while others seem to be stuck in internal limbo and are just not moving. 

Anyways with my lease renewal coming up i have more or less just decided to start winding down operations in the coming months and plan to close my store by the end of the year. This isn't happy ending, but between COVID / this screw up / having issues getting products my customers want i simply would rather just wind things down rather then trying to keep something going that isn't profitable. 

Thank you for your advice and help though."
198,Update: My ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (Florida),"**EDIT:** Forgot to add this...My first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update."
199,"When I was hired I was given a key and told if I lose it I owe $15,000. I lost it. Do I have to pay up?","I am located in Michigan.  

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss’ boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the “money I owe.”   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me “you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we’ll worry about that later.”   I replied with “to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven’t signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?”  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn’t forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of “verbal contract?” At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I’m not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. I can not afford this “charge.”

201,good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some. The next morning I found all my tires had been slashed. Screw him, I don't feel bad any more.

The rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise I don't know nearly enough about what I'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. A lot of the decisions I've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because I knew it would but because I had no idea what I was doing and left it up to him. I've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what I have. Thanks for all your comments."
202,"Update: Little brother (16) ran away from home because of abusive parents, is staying at my place and doesn't want to go back.","Quick update to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/m0gpdp/little_brother_16_ran_away_from_home_because_of/). The situation with my brother seems to be getting clearer, good news is he's still staying with me and likely will for some time. I can't go into too much detail, buts here's what happened. We called a family lawyer who was recommended by people I know. We then called DCFS with the lawyer to explain the situation. DCFS interviewed my little brother about his home life.   They also interviewed me to check that he was safe with me and seemed to conclude that he is even though they didn't tell me very clearly. They couldn't/didn't want to tell me whether they would recommend he stay with me or go back home however. We were also advised to call law enforcement, which we did. I also called our parents to let them know. My parents showed up at my place the next day and demanded to talk to my brother without me present. I let them in but I stayed there the whole time. My brother didn't budge and said he would stay with me no matter what and wouldn't go to the camp. Things got very tensed and there was a lot of yelling and ranting and nasty things were said to my brother. That's when I said  they were no longer welcome at my place and I would call the police if they didn't go away, and they left.

They came back that night to tell us that my brother can stay but he and I are disowned, they won't do anything for any of us now, they won't take him back and we're both dead to them. Then they drove back home. In a way convincing them to let my brother stay with me, at least temporarily, was easier than I had anticipated. The price to pay with our family is high but there was never going to be an easy solution. I was afraid of a big fight and they would call the police and accuse me of kidnapping  but thankfully that didn't happen. Good thing is my brother isn't going back to our parents, and our lawyer thinks that there's a good chance DCFS will allow him to stay with me. Complicated thing is that I hadn't planned to be taking care of a teenager any time soon so this is all new to me and frankly a bit overwhelming.  We're going to work with our lawyer to establish guardianship if that can be done. My bro and I are relieved that he (likely) can stay here and he's safe but there are tons of issues we still have to deal with like transferring schools, and above all helping him adapt to a new life in a new environment. A lot of work ahead of us for sure..."
203,I found my 30 year old fiancé talking to 13 and 14 year old children. What is my next step?,"I apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but I am pursuing the legal route instead

I found messages on my fiancé’s Snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. I took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before I left him. Upon talking to them I discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. The 14 year old claims that my fiancé was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. I have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. She also had one of my fiancé’s best friends added to her Snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

We also have a one year old daughter who I am going to protect from him at any cost. What can I do to ensure this?

204,"[PA/NY] Adopted out biological child has severe special needs, adoptive parents pushing us to help.","My now husband and I legally gave our first child up for adoption 10 years ago to some relatives. We now are married and have a child together. Our biological child has severe autism. He is nonverbal and cannot be toilet trained, among other things. 

The adoptive parents obviously know who we are because we are distant relatives. This was supposed to be a semi-open adoption, but we have only seen this child twice at family functions since his birth. Since December, they've started sending out messages and phone calls that make it clear that they believe this is somehow different than a normal adoption. They now want us to assume custody and care of our first child. The only written proof we have is a few texts saying that we need to ""take responsibility"" and that I ""need to contribute more than I might have thought"" because the child isn't normal. They've insinuated on calls that he may need to come live with us soon enough.

We can't afford the care this child needs, and he was legally adopted by these people at birth. What is our obligation here? We've stopped responding at all out of fear of creating an agreement or expectation, and we don't have money to just donate anyway."
205,Banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.,"in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I used to take the bus daily to get to work. Not a big deal, I'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

But every thursday was awful. Every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. Still, generally not an issue because I'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

But this bus company was not reliable. We have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. One day, a little school bus came instead. It had 9 seats. Since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. So you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

I have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. Considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, I needed that time to sit down. So, that's what I was doing, as always.

The group gets on the bus, I've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. I look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. I take out my earbuds and she says to me that I need to give up my seat. The other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when I tell her I need it she says that I need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. I try my best to explain that medically I can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says I'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). So after a couple minutes of this I snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as I'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. She gives me a look like I just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

Two days later when I tried to get on the bus I was told I was banned from the service.

When I called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. I explained the medical reasons I needed it and was simply told I have a lower priority because I'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as I ever knew. He ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as I know, but I feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

On my original post it was suggested a lot that I make a post here. I live in Ontario, Canada. I don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. I know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

Anyway that's why I'm here for help. Am I in the right to sue? For how much? I don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

EDIT: There's a lot of responses on here so I'm sorry if I don't get to everyone, but for now I will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Center on Monday. Thanks everyone. I'll still be accepting further advice if there is more I should do though obviously I can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

EDIT: I gave them a call. It went well, should be covered from here. Thanks all."
206,"Cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. He was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. I have her recorded confession. What should I do with it? (Arizona)","She accused him of rape years ago. She was 18 and he was 22. It was false and never happened. He was arrested and eventually convicted. When he served his stance and got out he was broken. From what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. He tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. His record, his name on the registry and lack of options. He went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. Within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

Yesterday was 3 years since his death. This cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. I said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. I went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. Also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). She told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. I asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

The voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

Are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? I want to make my brother's slate clean. Not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). His son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. If so, how do we begin the process? Do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

What consequences (criminal) will she face? Will she go to jail?

And, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? Of course this belongs to his son now although I don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). And can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? This conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.

I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.

Thank you all so much for your support, I am completely shocked right now"
208,[MA] Man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. Now they won’t take it off until he verifies that we don’t live together. He’s blocked my number.,"I bought a car last year from a mutual friend that I didn’t know well at all. Everything was fine until this past June, when he fell into some heavy debt. He gave me a call sometime around June, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which I refused. Red flag number one right there. After this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than I should’ve been monthly for this car). I eventually just gave the car back and that was that. I gave the car back mid July and purchased a new one (Nissan Altima) from a legitimate dealer. This morning I received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. I calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don’t live together, (we absolutely do not) I still have to pay it. This is absurd, how is this allowed? The guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can I provide proof for someone else? This is in Massachusetts and I have progressive insurance.


Update #1: okay so a lot has happened since I first posted. For starters, I should clarify some things. We signed an agreement that I would pay monthly increments for the title. Until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. Initially he said I would be under his insurance, but only a few days after I saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. I did not have the car in my name, which is why I was able to give it back so easily. I just thought “screw this drama, I’ll just get a new car.” Today my adjuster happens to be “out sick” but I reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. A representative of Progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. I have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. I’ve been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. I’m expecting a phone call and will update soon.

Update #2: Not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. Luckily I kept all of the text messages between us, which I attached to the reports I filed. With my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it’s a bit difficult to get this taken care of. After I settle this, because I am NOT paying an extra $500, I will most definitely be switching providers."
209,Neighbor cut down tree while I was at work.,"I own a home in New Jersey that has (had) a 100 year old oak tree that sat right on the property line between myself and my neighbor.  It was literally 50/50.  I came home to find everything but about 12’ of stump left.  I had absolutely zero prior notice. 

I purchased the property about 3 months ago.  This was a beautiful tree and I know this will have an impact on my property values.   What can/should I do?  Thanks. "
210,"I own a long-standing, extremely professional massage therapy center in NY and this morning a pretty big radio station said we were an illegitimate Spa who gives happy endings.

Feels like a retraction means nothing nowadays and I’ve already received calls from people confused and upset, even a few asking if we are going out of business.

212,"(Update) Surprise divorce, Husband cleared bank accounts","Update from: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xicm3/husband_surprised_me_with_a_divorce_cleaned_out/?utm_source=reddit-android

I wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. Today however was really busy, I spoke to a few people I was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

I'm told by the end of the week I should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything I need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so I can continue to survive until I can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

I'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

I am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

I probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure I was going to be OK and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! I also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that I won't make and explained the situation. They are somewhat understanding and hopefully I'll be back at work soon to keep current. 

Thanks for everyone's help and advice! "
213,My coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.,"About 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. It was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. He has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. The police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

Well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. They worked together and went to highschool together. 

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm in a very bad position. Would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? Is there anything I can do legally? It's been about 6 months since the disqualification and I'm in arizona.

Edit: I wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me."
214,Landlord thinks my house is his,"Y’all. I’m so annoyed. we’ve been living in our new place for less than a full week and our landlord has popped up over here and tried to just walk in with his key three times. Today I drove up just as he was unlocking our door to walk in and I’m just like “what are you doing here?” 

The first time I walked out of my bedroom up to see him just standing in my living room looking at my thermostat. Literally didn’t even acknowledge the fact that he was in the unit like by saying “anyone home” or anything. I was about to pepper spray the fuck out of him because his back was to me and I was home alone. 

Today he said he needed to do maintenance on the a/c and proceeded to crane his neck to look in every room with a door open and rummage through my cabinets in my kitchen. 

I really don’t wanna be THAT tenant but I can’t do this for a year. It’s always just him telling me some small shit that could have been said over the phone. The anxiety of thinking someone is in my house when I’m not home is too much. I’ve rented since I was 18 and never had a landlord who just pops up at all hours of the day."

Fast forward a week and I find out they have left without telling me and have stripped a lot of things.  Most plants and a small tree have vanished from the garden (leaving a cratered landscape). Some parts of the interior have gone missing as well. This is what i found after entering my house: cupboard doors are gone, laminate flooring in the hallway was taken out, every kitchen appliance disappeared (built in oven, washing machine ..). There wasn't a single light fixture (or bulb) left, some door knobs were removed and they even pulled out the kitchen sink. How do I proceed from here? This can't be legal, can it?

216,"Rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.","I hired a well reviewed [rover.com](https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on Fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. I dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on Fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) I break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. I find out through Bunz and FB that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

I get into the city and start looking on foot. He informs me that he has called the police and TAS (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough Rover. He then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. Great right? This is where things get unpleasant.

It's -10C outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider I realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. I call [rover.com](https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. I get a tip from Facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to TAS, but I needed to call them for a more accurate description. I call TAS when they open on Sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. At that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that I would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) This is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

I continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, I double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. I finally get a tip off to his location through Facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. This is after 17h straight of walking in -10C weather. I covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because I was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. I couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

I speak to [rover.com](https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. It turns out they were never collected from the Staples that printed them. So this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. I have them now as evidence.

&#x200B;

Emotions aside, is there any course of action I can take to deal with this person? By lying about the search, the posters and the TAS report he delayed valuable search tools that I could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. I also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

This guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. (If at all) 

Edit: to clarify I did eventually find my dog, he’s safe but it was a hellish experience.

We haven't been paid a cent nor have they called us back to negotiate the cost of damages, trees taken, lot buyers that have now backed out, and acreage they have taken.

218,Update: [FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"Link to original post in case you need it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

I've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, I can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) The day after my post, I called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since I inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. He went to both houses the next day, saying that I had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. He went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. Apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how I need to learn my place. After he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) I conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. As expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. I'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, I never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until I watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) The bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""Our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that I'm getting married!"" The pastor, feigning innocence, said ""I thought she was evicting you all because your father and \[Groom\]'s father cut down \[My Great-Grandmother\]'s prize magnolias?"" Hardest game of You-Laugh-You-Lose I've ever played, still proud I survived.

4) According to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. Then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say I would be quite happy with half that number, but I know when to zip my lips so I'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) They did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. I have enough savings/inheritance left that I can live without the rents for a while, so I'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before I was born.

6) The bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. They had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (Am I a bad person for being amused?)

7) Hurricane Michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) My boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

&#x200B;

Other than that, you'll have to wait until the eternally slow court systems process through. I do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time. I'd never really stood up to my elders like that before, and it was comforting to know that not only did a gaggle of internet strangers have my back, but there were resources and protections in my community as well."
219,UPDATE Brother's friend wanted a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes and a bed' while he moved back with his parents until the covid crisis is over. My house was packed with stinky furniture and it's all OK now. NSW Australia,"It's all solved. On Monday morning I sent photos of everything disgusting I could and of doug's furniture on the lawn to doug and his dad telling them it's beyond foul and I wouldn't be keeping any of it inside my house, and I'll dump it this week if they don't come get it.

Twenty minutes later I got a call from doug's *mother*. She asked if it was so bad could I send her some evidence, like photos. I told her I'd already sent them to her son and his dad. She yelled out in the background to one of them ""She says she DID send photos"" then she got off the phone.

Half an hour later she called me back and said they'd be down to pick up doug's stuff, and apologised. She asked if his books were OK. Apart from the mouse gnawing and droppings, yes. I'm not a barbarian, they were outside but under the eaves.

This morning they turned up from 600km away. doug and his dad wanted to begin packing in their pantech but doug's mum wasn't having any of that. They dumped 90% of it at the tip and came back & took just a few things home. Even the food in the freezers was off. His mum apologised and offered to make me good with cash, but she's already solved enough and I declined. She left it open ended and said if I needed anything fixed to call her.

I know I didn't follow legal advice, but this was the equivalent of someone asking you to hold onto a small keychain sized box for half a year, but instead they sneakily cover you in fifty kilos of feces you're not allowed to wash off until you get a lawyer and fill out all the right paperwork and wait a month. I just couldn't do it. I got lucky.

I've had words with my brother and changed the locks to my place too. He'd opened up and let doug and doug's mates in, then left the key behind with him. He didn't know how bad it was either.

My brother is an idiot and doug is a 32 year old baby and hopefully I'm a little wiser."
220,Accepted a fake $50 at the restaurant I work at. Employer is taking it out of our tips. Employer has not provided us with a pen or light to check bills.,"My first week working and I accepted a fake 50. Our shop owner is taking the money out of our collective tips that we earn.

221,[MA] A restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant,"So I wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

I won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks I've missed out something crucial, I'll be happy to edit the post.

My boyfriend and I went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. My boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. We had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. We arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

We have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. The waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. She said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. We see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. She says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. She started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). The waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. She came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. We said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

We flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. She was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. She told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. She asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. The waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

The waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but I insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. She went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

My boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. As of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

On my original post, I was given many different types of advice; I was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. As I have been looking after my boyfriend all night, I have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. As a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the ER or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. However, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


TL;DR - My celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?"
222,"UPDATE: I am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. I got found out.","I post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

How incredibly bad is that plan? Before anyone says it. I know... I know ok I should have quit a long time ago. I did not.

My post got a decent amount of attention. I thought I would update since I still get really sweet messages from people wishing me well/praying for me and my family. 

My fiance, now husband did pull through! He's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys. He was in a coma for over a month and the doctor's were pretty sure he would never wake up. His recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier! Although it was a horrible thing to go through it changed both of us for the better. You don't realize how much the small things matter until they're about to be taken from you. 


He was appalled by his sisters actions when I finally discussed it with him. We recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance SIL or BIL will get any money if both of us were to pass, or God forbid our children too. We also chose godparents for our children and we are expecting a baby girl in 2018! 

I really appreciate all of the sweet thoughtful messages I was sent. They definitely made me feel better on bad days to know how many people were praying for him! "
224,"My abusive ex tracked me down in Missouri after I’d been hiding from him there a few years by finding my name & new location in voter data. Would it be permissible in Missouri for me to request a name change under seal? If not, is there a state more suited for that? I’m very over his murder attempts",
225,I found explicit videos and pictures in my child's phone,"My ex and I share custody of our daughter (age 6). When I picked her up today, she brought her phone that usually stays at her dad's house. She was showing me pictures she took, and as I was scrolling I found dozens of nude pictures and videos of men mastubating in her cloud. These pictures have been uploaded for the last 6 months at least, and she has had access to them. 

If what I think is the case is true, then it seems like her grandfather has a dirty little secret, and because her phone is logged into the same account as his is their pictures sync to the same cloud. If this is true he probably has no clue that he has basically been giving her access to this stuff. However, like I said she has had access to these things for the last 6 months at least which is unacceptable and extremely worrisome.

What should I do? Is there any legal action I should take? She was extremely upset when I found them and tried to hide them. She also lied about not recognizing one of the men in the pictures. It is actually someone she knows very well. I am planning on trying to find a therapist maybe to talk to her about what all she may have seen, but I'm really at a loss right now. It's 2 am, and I don't know what to do. Also in Louisiana if that makes a difference.

EDIT: For those that are lucky enough to not have to coparent with a difficult ex or have not been through a divorce--here is some insight as to how custody orders work. As we have joint custody, we both have to agree on decisions regarding medical issues and education. Outside of those things, we each get to set the pace when our child is in our care. Ideally we would mostly be on the same page, but my ex is much more lax than I am about basically everything. Not only do I not want to change our moderately structured routine to match his lack of one, I have two additional kids in my home that thrive on it and changing it every other week to match his level of parenting would be terrible for them.

We had a conversation about the phone when they gave it to her two years ago (YES SHE HAD JUST TURNED 5), and I objected. If I had any actual legal grounds to prevent them from giving it to her, we wouldn't be in this situation."

QBK brings the packages to the base of the porch, looks at the stairs, looks at my dad in the wheelchair, and sets the packages on the ground 3 steps down from him. 

When he asks if she could please hand him the packages because he can't reach them, **she turns around and walks away!**

The packages sat there for the rest of the day until I got home.

This has officially gone from incompetent to malicious."
228,My wife has become an essential oil mom and I can’t convince her to stop using them on my kids. Do I have any recourse?,"My kids are constantly covered in oils. She uses the diffusers in their rooms while they sleep and in the kitchen and living room.  They basically breathe and wear oils all day. I can’t convince her to stop and the kids are always ill with breathing issues and skin rashes.  She uses Young Living and maintains that since they are pure, they present no danger. She won’t hear anything to the contrary. Is there anything I can do legally to keep the oils away from the kids. We are still married and living in the same household. Location: California"
229,"Boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn’t working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. What should we do??","Trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than I thought. So I put my update here. 

OP is still published at the bottom of this post

I know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. Which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how stupid I must be for believing his reasoning. Whelp! He got off house arrest on Tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), I asked if he would mind if I uploaded his “certificate of completion” to reddit and he said that was fine.

[Certificate of Completion ](https://imgur.com/a/BY974wg)

A few people asked some really good questions so I’m going to try to be as clear as possible:

He really was not on probation or parole. When he went to trial he was given the option to “complete the program,” which was a year with a PRIVATELY OWNED house arrest company. If he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

The terms of his house arrest, as per the company’s rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. He could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. Every other week he was required to “check in,” which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. He had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

Now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was “sentenced” due to DUS charges).

He was never on parole. He was never on probation. This entire ordeal was due to being a “habitual traffic offender.” A year of house arrest. For driving without insurance. He could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. Does ANY of that make what he did okay? Absolutely not. But I did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. He has completed the program and now we’re going to the beach.

Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk I hope this cleared things up. Sorry for the lengthy post.

OP:

Title explains it all. What is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? I suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn’t go anywhere. He thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn’t go anywhere. 

Time is a factor. What do we do??

Edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. He called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it’s supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iPhone so we even shared his location with them. Everything we could think of.


At 12:29am we got this text back:
“Sorry so late.. I have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. I looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn’t. Either it’s not connected or charger not working. Still showing low battery. Call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. I’m sorry.”

Crisis averted. Sounds like we’ll just stay put until the office opens and then we’ll go in to get everything checked, and we’ll be sharing his iPhone location with them until then.

I would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. We are in South Carolina.
2. He is not on probation or parole. He has never in his life been convicted of a crime. He was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were DUIs, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. The house arrest company is a privately owned business. There is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/WEEK. Capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

Thanks again for everything and if anything changes I’ll let y’all know.

Final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! Horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. Thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

EDITEDIT: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. I want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. I may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once I get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it’s late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. Thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


Absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: Okay kids, it’s been a long day. We laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. But at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf’s current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three DUS (driving under suspension) arrests. He was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. Irresponsible? Oh absolutely, he’s known from the beginning how I feel about it. But, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. The disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where I was confused and as a result confused some of y’all. He had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. Was that stuff irresponsible? Yes. Illegal?? Also yes. But a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? You betcha. We had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and I learned a lot. To everyone saying I’m dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and I’m sorry to disappoint you but that’s all there is to it. He will be getting off house arrest on September 10th, and to celebrate we’re going to the beach. The end."
230,"Cousin needs a life-saving hysterectomy but insurance doctor won't approve because ""She's not done having babies.""","My cousin has been getting these terrible infections after having her first child. After trying a few treatments, her doctor informed her she's at serious risk of life-threatening hemorrhaging and she needs a hysterectomy. However, when her doctor tried to clear it with the insurance, their doctor (who has never met my cousin) informed her that he would not approve of her surgery **because she's young and shouldn't throw away her chance to have more children.** He said, ""If you were 40, I'd approve this. But you're \[young\] and only have one child so far.""

This seems incredibly wrong to me. I know people have tried taking on insurance companies before but how on earth would you start? Thank you for any support at all. She lives in Utah but the insurance company is based out of Minnesota.

Update: Thank you everyone, especially those of you who reached out including doctors, insurance specialist, nurses and everyone else. I relayed all the information on to my cousin. Her doctor had completed the peer to peer but she’s begun the appeal process with help from a lot of your comments. I really appreciate all your help and she does as well.

Edit: My cousin put out a video with more details but I can't include it as it has identifying personal information. I've also removed any mention of her exact age."
231,[UPDATE][Oregon] Neighbor cut down trees on my property,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


Hello legal advice community! I have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! I'll get right to it. I can't speak to all the details, and I'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway I figured it would be best not to). To keep it short, we (my lawyer and I) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). I don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


I hauled his ass into court. Well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. The trees were on my property and they were white oaks. The arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. I also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. It then became a question of whether I wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. Basically, do I want the trees back or do I want the cost of the ones I lost? (apparently you can't have both).

Well guys...

I PICKED THE TREES.

The actual court stuff started a lot sooner than I thought. We filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. Apparently he was wealthier than I thought. We accepted and while I can't speak to the details of it...

I'M GETTING THE TREES BACK!

It's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until September since the process didn't start until just this week due to the Holidays), but I will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! My neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and I haven't seen him for quite some time now. Oh well! There's a bit more to the settlement, but I don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

I remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. I ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. My trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). Not even close! Just thought I'd add that in.


Anyways, there it is! I plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and I have them back. I'll be sure to share them! I want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! I didn't know you all were so into trees, but I'm glad you are!

Have a good one everyone!"
232,My abusive ex sold my house without my knowledge,"I inherited my mom’s house when she died. A couple years ago, my then boyfriend moved in with me. But he turned abusive and after a particularly bad night about a year and a half ago, I fled and moved to another city. I just heard from a mutual friend that my ex moved out of state several months ago. 


I went to my house over the weekend to check on it and make a plan to move back in but there’s another couple living there now. They said they bought the house and have all the paperwork to prove it. When I tried explaining that I actually owned the house they acted like I was crazy and threatened to call the police unless I left immediately. 


I’m heartbroken because not only have I lost a place that is sentimental to me, but my abusive ex got all the money from the sale. Is there anything I can do? I’m in Maryland."
233,Suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. She requested I take care of her children (1m 3f). Her family took them instead against her wishes. (UT),"My best friend is a single mom. The other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. She has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. She has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

She has requested that I take care of her children while she is gone. We are very close and her children love me. She trusts me completely with them. We have plans to move in together in soon. I am not a parent, but I have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

I received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). They wanted to watch the children for a little bit. I was fine with this as I wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. My friend was very upset that I let her cousin watch her children and requested I pick them up as soon as possible. She has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

Her family doesn't want to return the children to me. They claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. They believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

What can I do in this case? Her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. I have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. She even wants the children to be with me and not them. Does her will not matter to CPS? Would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? Or would I be completely fine caring for her children?

**Edit: I have received a lot of great advice. Thank you! I will be going to get the children asap. Many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. I can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. She also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state I am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that I am having difficulty getting them back. Should I continue to have difficulty, I will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. I would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. I understand their concern about CPS and I'm hoping that the advice I receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and CPS won'tbe an issue. Should I show them my home and that I am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**Edit 2: I have the children back. I talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me CPS was a non-issue. She even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. Her friend is with me in this and believes I am fully fit to have them. Still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and I'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**Edit 3: Thread has been locked but I have received plenty of helpful advice. Thank you for all of your well wishes. I have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. The 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. I also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. I am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**"
234,I was fired for not coming into work with 5.5 hours notice sent at 3:30 am.,"This happened in San Antonio, Texas.

So at 3:30 am today, my boss texted me to come into work at 9 am. I was asleep and didn't check my phone until 3:30 pm. I responded by saying I was asleep when I got his text and if I had been awake, 5.5 hours is not enough time to sleep before a day of work(8.5 hour shift). I also asked him to please start giving me 24 hours of notice before work (he never posted a schedule, only texted me at most two days before he needed me to come in, though often less than a day's notice). I was never once 'on-call'.

I was a part-time, W-2 employee (I think, because tax deductions are on my paychecks, though I was never given a W-4), though I always drew my paychecks from the folder labeled 'contract labor'. I was employed from 7/30 until 11/11 (today).

As I understand it, the Fair Labor Standards act says employers need to give at least 24 hours notice before work, but I am in an at-will employment state and nothing I can find online tells me whether or not this federal act applies here. Is there grounds to sue for this?

Edit: Someone else mentioned to me this might count as retaliation. Is that true?"
235,Kid reached over the wall and filmed my daughter while she was crying in a bathroom stall at school (6th grade) in Texas. The kid then posted the video to social media.,"That happened about two weeks ago.  It was initially pushed down to a guidance counselor as a ""friends issue"".  My wife went to the school about a week ago because the issue had yet to be resolved; a group of girls were still picking on our daughter.  Since then, one the assistant principals conducted an investigation.  The girl that did the recording is still running around the campus with her phone, and now our daughter is labeled a snitch and bullied even more because of the way the school has handled it.

Needless to say, we're a bit pissed.  Our daughter won't be going back to that school.  We're not really sure what to do next.  Do any of you fine folks out there have any advice on a way ahead?

Edit: Forgot to mention two important details:
1. The kid that did the recording...she admitted to doing it in a written statement to the school. She denied posting it to social media, but other kids have told our daughter they saw the video posted on music.ly.

2 .  Our daughter has a 504 plan for anxiety and PTSD."

237,[Update] My father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.,"A lot has happened since I posted.

I talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. I went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. After a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. They basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

We ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (NOT the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. We are currently still with them. 

The police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. He has been arrested for the child porn. Unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. It's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. People wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

My sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. We are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... Ideally.. 

She and I both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. Our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  Mom is still not in the picture.

I fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. My case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. Thanks for that advice reddit, I got that from here. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice. It helped me talk her into how serious it was.

(New York)

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

239,(Ohio) Cop blocking my driveway and harassing me and my wife.,"**EDIT** 

Holy wow this blew up. Thanks for the silver kind stranger! I received so many messages, so if I don't reply to your message I'm really sorry. I will go through and reply to as many as possible!

I have received so much amazing information on this post since I made it. Unfortunately it is a holiday today and I am going to try spending today with friends. I am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can’t figure this out. No updates or calls back as of yet... I’ll keep everyone posted.

As of 12/31 at 3:40PM EST I have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. I have yet to get a call back. I’ll update everyone here when I get a call back (if I do.)

Hello Legal Advice!

So, here’s some backstory:

Me and my fiancé moved into this new place back in April. We’ve been living here since then. The town I live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. The cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. There is a major highway that runs between here and Cincinnati. They are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what’s happening in town. 

Fast forward until now. There was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiancé had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that’s kinda loud). She was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. She took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. Right? Nah.

Now, this guy knows where we live. He drives by all the time and he knows when my fiancé leaves for work. He follows me now, in my 2010 Honda Civic (it’s a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as I do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. There is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and “clock” people, however, it’s right across from our home.

Today was the last straw. When my fiancé was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. He is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. He sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as I’m almost home begins pulling out. My fiancé needed to go to work, so I decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

On her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiancé to leave. He sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. She calls me and says she’s afraid to leave, so I tell her to stay for a bit. He eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

Here’s the kicker. My ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. I’ve saved a copy to my phones storage. What can we do about this? This is clearly harassment and this guy doesn’t let up. It’s a shame when I’m fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. Is there any way I can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? I only fear this will make things a lot worse. Cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

Feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

Thanks, sorry for the long post."
240,I think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. What options do I have? (OK)," I’m a high school teacher. I work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. “Dan,” my “across the hall mate” has  been here 8. His son,”Leo” has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. Leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. Since Dan was the football coach, Leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. Leo would  often visit his dad’s classroom before and after school and I got to  know him as well. Leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

This past summer, Dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. They asked me if I would be a source of support for  Leo while they were away. While Leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so I would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. I also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. The last day I was to be in this role, Leo sent me a VERY  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. I told Leo that  was inappropriate and that I would be telling his father.

I showed Dan the text and he claimed that Leo’s phone must’ve been  “hacked” or “played with” while Leo was at work. I didn’t believe that  explanation, but I accepted it and moved on. The next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from Leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could “hold on to me” and “take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler” and “kiss me gently.” I forwarded the texts to Dan and did not  response to Leo.

Dan came to my house the next day and said that Leo was not sending  those texts. He said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. Then, I started getting texts through some “unknown number”  that were the same in tone and writing. A selfie of Leo nude was also  sent. I called Dan, thinking this might be something happening at Leo’s  job or something.

This didn’t stop. I was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. As soon as I blocked one, another popped up. I went down to the  store where Leo worked and spoke with the manager. (I taught all of his  children). He told me that Leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker’s phone and he had already talked to Dan about it two weeks  ago! So, Dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

I changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. This included my new number. Dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. The next thing I know, I’m getting crazy texts again. I  said something to Dan at work. Dan said Leo was “harmless” and I should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more I avoid him, the  more miserable it makes Leo. Dan even said those days that my number  stopped working Leo became very angry and Dan had to give him  medication.

Last night, when I got home from work, my kids told me that Leo had  come by looking for me. I was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. The kids said he arrived in a car, but not Dan’s car.  My son guessed it was an Uber. I don’t want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

Am I being stalked?  
Am I being unsympathetic to Leo’s problems?  
Is it wrong of me to expect Dan to manage his son’s problems?  
What do I do next? 

I’m not going anywhere, and I doubt Dan is, so we will be “across the hall mates” for another 10 years…

(I initially posted this to relationships but was told this was a better place for it.)

Thank you in advance for any suggestions."
241,Minor Daughter Refuses Abortion.,"TW: Sex, Minor

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm still shook and my boyfriend and I have been freaking out since we found out. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

Our daughter is 11 years old. We found out she was pregnant. She had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. We never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
I'm at such a fucking loss. My world is crumbling.

EDIT: This happened in rural Oklahoma

EDIT 2: Okay, I'm going to file a report after all. I was under the guise that there wasn't anything that I could do, but I see that isn't true. Hopefully I have enough info to get these punks tracked down. Thanks everyone for your help! I really appreciate it!

UPDATE: I talked to an officer and he said that they didn't consider it animal abuse if it wasn't a domestic animal in question. He said the local lake patrol was unlikely to do much about it, but I could try to report it anyway.

UPDATE 2: I have reported the incident and given my description of the boys. I've done all I can do; it's in their hands now. Thank you to everyone who gave advice! My question has been answered."

Officially as of today Jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. We were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). Which i did. Honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

I talked to someone who is doing a story on Jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on AirBNB (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). She isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

I don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. AirBNB to this day still has my place being listed on AirBNB. Who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

My apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. There are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. But my apartment is safe more or less. 

Anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at Christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. "
245,[NE] HOA towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land,"So this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

Link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


So I was away for the holidays and I came back on Monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to HOA. I immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. The car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so I have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. It's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the HOA.


I had my lawyer draft up the C&D and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. I hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since I'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

My lawyer suggested I send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. A local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested I ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. The HOA has lawyered up so I think it's best I no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. I didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. I've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. It's bad but should convey the land.

246,I'm pregnant and I want to leave my husband [update],"Hi everyone,

I want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. I read every single comment on both threads about my situation and I really really appreciate the support and help. If not for the advice here, I probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

I'm sorry for taking so long to post, but I am now back home in NH with my parents. I feel like I'm coming out of a fog and I feel really stupid for believing everything; I guess I just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

I left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. I'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as I am still on my dad's phone plan. My husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but I haven't spoken to him.

I managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. The third is a local bank and I did not want to stay in the area any longer. My parents told me to just leave the money. They are going to help me get the medical procedures I need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. I thought they would say I told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree. 

Thank you again for all your kind words!"
247,Update - PhD student here being accused of plagiarism. Only that it's my own work that I used. Massachusetts.,"I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my PhD thesis.

To make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what I had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. This wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

Last week I got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that I talked to. The email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, I will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

I asked for appointments with a few people. Head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. I haven't managed to see any of them yet.

Today, I received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. They apologized for the stress that this has caused. A little later, I received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who I talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

So that's that. Now I can graduate in peace. I cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. Thanks all for advice. "
248,Being sued for helping a choking victim (OR),"I was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. I realized he was choking and went to help him, I had Heimlich training at my place of work (I’m office safety manager for my floor). The guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. He looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. I felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. This was two weeks ago.
 
Today I got a letter from a law firm that I’m getting sued for battery, they said I bruised a rib, I have no clue how this guy figured out who I am. I thought I helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. How did he figure out who I am? I never actually spoke to him. Is this a real letter? Do I need a lawyer for this?
 

Edit: the language i used to describe him choking was wrong. He was choking, gagging sounds but otherwise silent and obviously distressing. "
249,"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they’ll drop me from my classes","(IA) I was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

I am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and I’ll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

I’d spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days I’d be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work I’d be missing. 

Unfortunately, one of the days I’ll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

His request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if I missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

My professors were comfortable marking these as “reported absences” which basically means there was a justification like a doctor’s note or other official documentation. 

I showed the deans that I was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn’t  even really like I had a choice. I figured that would be enough documentation. 

The dean said that “personal non-medical conflicts” could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if I’d just  slept through class). They suggested I apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise I’d be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

This attack took enough from me already, I went to great lengths to be sure I didn’t miss a day of school while recovering, I do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

I spoke to the title IX Office who’d promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

I do not want to take a leave of absence. All my professors were ready and willing to work with me and I was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

Do I have any legal recourse here against the school? 

Thank you in advance. "
250,(update) nearly 3 months later about the kid I didn't know existed for ten years,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpt2ez/i_found_out_i_had_a_child_when_cps_contacted_me/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

It's been almost 3 months now and I thought I'd come in real quick to give an update. 

Overall, the kid and I are doing great. I really expected the adjustment period to suck but I feel like maybe this poor kid really needed some structure and stability and totally glommed onto that. I try to just give her as much of my love, patience, structure and stability that I have to give. I've been learning a lot about attachment, trauma, and everything. It's been overwhelming but every night, no matter how exhausted I am, I get into bed and I thank God for her. I wouldnt trade her for anything in this world. I tell her every night she's my favorite thing. 

Legally things are kind of boring. I did the DNA test, unsurprisingly got the result that she's mine biologically. The emergency order is still in place. Had mom is still in jail, she was offered the option of going to rehab and refused. She'll be in jail for at least a few more months, and after she's out we will make a parenting plan for visits with help from the social worker. Realistically i think she'll die before she gets clean. That sounds like a horrible thing to say but it is how it is. 

It's been a wild ride. It's not easy. But it's joyful and it's really changed my life & made me want to be better in a lot of ways."
251,Boss constantly touches/chokes/body checks me. Others who report similar behavior to HR have been fired.,"NJ: I am an adult male and my boss (male, few years older) consistently touches me in front of dozens of other people in a professional office setting. He has put me in a headlock, he often grabs my shoulders or neck and shakes me, he tousles my hair, he often hipchecks me when I’m standing at someone else’s desk. I’ve told him to stop but that makes it worse. Other people have complained to HR and been fired for this exact complaint, so I feel like I have no recourse there. 

On top of that he is a blatant racist and sexist, and says shit out loud in the office that I wouldn’t even say to my friends at the bar. 

Should I get a hidden camera on my desk and present footage to him or to HR? or try the HR route myself? Should I just talk to him first and then get a camera? Not sure what the best path forward is. Interested to hear your thoughts. "
252,Does my employer have the right to tell me that I'm not allowed to use food banks - WA,"I'm a social worker, and work primarily with homeless teens. It's something I'm passionate about because I fled my mom's sexually abusive boyfriend when I was 13 and have been flying solo ever since, so I can really relate to what it's like being a street kid. I enjoy my job and feel like I'm really good at it. However, I only make about 29k/yr. I have a husband who's a forklift operator, and together we have four children, a cat, and a dog. Our household income is about 40-50% of the median income for Seattle, we live paycheck to paycheck. When crap hits the fan and unexpected expenses come up, we often need to use food banks, and then we normally use things like free clinics and the Salvation Army coat drive. It's not unheard of for me to run into current kids in the program and former clients from work when accessing these services. 

My employer overheard some kids (clients) in the office talking about how they saw me with my children at the food bank over the weekend. I brushed it off like, oh yeah they're great folks, our car has been giving us trouble and we needed a little help. No big deal right? I naturally transitioned the conversation into other things that weren't about me.   


So my boss pulls me into his office later and starts grilling me about why I'm using the foodbank. Uh, because you pay me 29k/yr? I have a family? My car keeps breaking down and I can't afford to replace it? It was like he was trying to shame me. He was acting like I was gaming the system because I'm a social worker, taking resources because I can, which couldn't be further from reality. He brought up the ethics of seeing clients outside of work and how I needed to be mindful of places I went, saying I shouldn't be going to the foodbanks and resources that we refer clients to--which, spoiler alert, is pretty much all of them in the city. I told him that I was eligible to use them based on my income, that my family depended on them to eat right now, that I wasn't using my employment status to garner any kind of favoritism, and that I went to the foodbanks closest to my house. 

He basically told me that I need to stop going to the food bank or I'd be let go.

253,[UPDATE] Bartender took my (real) ID and Passport and won't give them back!,"I posted my dilemma [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7gd18f/minc_bartender_took_my_real_id_and_passport_and/)

MI/NC

It turns out, I actually ended up calling the wrong police jurisdiction. This morning I called the East Lansing PD non-emergency line (whom I called the previous night), and I spoke to an officer who told me that they only have jurisdiction on campus and 3 blocks surrounding campus. The venue/bar I was attending is actually on the city line between East Lansing and Lansing, so the officer directed me to the Lansing PD. 

The LPD officer told me that bar always calls about fake ID's and-- in his words-- ""90% of the time, they're wrong"" so he told me not to worry and he would get my identification back for me. Long story short, I got my stuff back and I got to rub it in the bartender and managers face that I was right all along. "
254,Friend forced to have sex with boss while she was incapacitated,"My friend was interning during her summer while she was studying at university in Pennsylvania. Her boss was always very nice to her, and asked her to get drinks with him on her last day of work. They went to a bar, and got sufficiently drunk - where he admitted he was attracted to her. She brought up the fact that he's married, and he acknowledged it. He wanted her to come to his house to meet his wife. She agreed, and so they went to his place. My friend met the wife, and they all drank some more. At this point, my friend blacked out and can't remember anything that happened after this point. She only remembers her boss saying, ""you should take your pants off."" She doesn't even remember if she did do that.

Next morning, the wife was dropping her off, and was extremely hostile with her. Turns out, the boss had sex with my friend, while the wife was watching. The wife also apparently made out with my friend. In the morning, the wife forced my friend to take a Plan B (apparently, the guy didn't use a condom). She somehow got a hold of my friend's phone number, social media handles etc., and harrasses her regularly - calls her names and insults her a lot. 

My friend is afraid to take any kind of action as she does not want her parents to find out (she's an international student). What options does she have? Is it possible for her to proceed legally in the US without her parents ever finding out back home?"
255,"Spectrum Cable refuse to stop sending sales reps to my door after multiple contacts to the company, as well as calling the sheriff's office twice. I am being told they can send new reps each time because each criminal trespassing notice only applies to the person, not the business.","I live in Maine.  I severed ties with Spectrum when I moved.  I continued to receive mail to my attention, and filled out the form on their website in early 2019 to remove myself from their mailing list.  Mail finally ceased, but they then began to send their employees to my door.  

I told the first two (who arrived together) they were not welcome, and that just because I asked the company to remove me from the mailing list does not mean I instead want them to come to my door.  They were upset with my telling them this, but left.  I work from home and make phone calls and they cause my dog to start barking, so this interrupts my work.

I presumed contact would stop.  A few weeks later, another rep showed up.  I told him I had already advised his company that their reps are not welcome and he is now trespassing.  The rep stated, ""yeah I know, but that wasn't \*me\*.""  He emphasized the ""me"" part of that, which told me the company was aware I told reps to leave, but planned to swap out reps and send new ones.

I called my local sheriff and the deputy told me that he could not go to Spectrum itself and serve them any sort of notice, as he could do with individuals.  He said he would recommend I reach out to the company further.  

I contacted Spectrum's chat (no corporate number available) and was escalated to a manager, and informed them that I have repeatedly told their agents to leave and any further agents they send are violating 17-A MRS §402 and are trespassing.  I advised her I work from home and of the disruption.  She verified my address and assured me that I was removed from further contacts.  I saved screenshots of the chat.

Yesterday, another Spectrum agent arrived knocking at my door.  I opened the door, took a picture of him, walked out and took a picture of his license plate, and called the sheriff, and asked a deputy to arrive to explain to this rep that this business cannot continue to do this.  He arrived, took down the name and DOB of the rep, and said he can only issue criminal trespass notices to each rep.  The Spectrum rep's manager called him and said he would be there.  The agent asked for my number so the manager could call me, and I provided it to him.  I advised the deputy he can meet with the manager, but if he doesn't feel I need to be around I am going back to work.  He did so (I could see from the window) and I believed it resolved.  

I received a call from the manager, which I thought would be apologetic.  It was not.  He advised me that since the house is a rental, if he takes it off the list for ""service"" (these are not service calls; they are sales) then no other tenants in the future could have service.  I advised him that is not true, because those tenants could simply call Spectrum and change the status, since both he and the agent have told me this is a toggle-able feature in their system.  He said he would not do that and I said that I hear him implying I have no rights as the tenant, and that the landlord needs to contact him, but he is not explicitly stating that; he is just stating he will not remove me from marketing because he wants to continue in spite of being told they are not welcome.  He advised me he did not feel the call was productive at that point (at no point did I swear or curse) and I advised him at this point he is pushing me to a lawsuit.  He said to go ahead and file my lawsuit.  I told him that is never something a manager should tell a customer, and he said ""yeah, hearsay buddy"" and disconnected.  

I am awestruck at this point.  I have done everything I can think of and Spectrum has acknowledged the impact to my work, has acknowledged my multiple reports to the authorities, and because of the apparent unprofessional culture of their sales managers, they are going to continue to harass me at my residence.  

Can anyone with knowledge of a person's rights in this sort of situation in Maine give me advice?  I have no idea what to do at this point to avoid the continued harassment and trespassing."
256,Diabetes,"Hey, my 17 year old son has T1 diabetes. He relies mainly on his phone for glucose monitoring. Yesterday the public school he attends took his phone. Their policy is that is you are “Using for your phone to much” they take it. First time 1 day. Second time 3 days. Third time 5 days. (End of school week) In the past is has not been a problem because after school I have been able to get it. I am out of the country on business and my wife is out of state as well. My wife called the school and they say the will only give the phone back to a “Parent or Legal Guardian” the school knows he has Diabetes. There is no documentation that he uses his phone for glucose. He offered to show the principal. Yesterday my son went to the drug store after school and got a finger pricker. He told me he would be “Fine”. I know how much he hates using one and it is not as good as the continuous glucose monitor on his phone. What legal rights do I have to make the achool give him back his phone before Thursday when My wife gets home?

I am in Alabama

Thank you all the support and advice. My son’s endo faxed an order and made multiple thinly veiled threats over the phone. My wife’s mother went and met my son at school today. They gave her his phone. We have his phone. All is good for now. However, to make sure this doesn’t happen again I am going to have a lawyer send a letter and hopefully scare them shitless. They are going into apologies and cover my ass mode. It is getting late here is Germany and I have a big day tomorrow. Thanks again!"
257,Found out wife was married before me and never divorced,"My wife and I are getting divorced after 19 years of marriage. She moved out 2 weeks ago and is living with her parents. The kids are with me. One of my daughters was at grandma's house this week visiting her mom and grandma mentioned to her this is her second marriage. My daughter mentioned it to me when she got home. I phoned my wife and she told me her high school boyfriend (he was 18, she was 16) took off to Mexico and got legally married. When they broke up a year later, they just broke up, never divorced. 
I have called my attorney to get some answers on this, his legal aide said he is out until Tuesday. It is killing me. I basically have 2 questions. Was I even married? We wed in the U.S., not Mexico and divorcing in the U.S. And two, we have a beach house in Cabo San Lucas. Is that now owned by 3 people (her first husband) and will that affect the sale when we try to sell? 

Also, no, I did not file for divorce because of this. It was just growing apart. I actually think it is kind of funny as long as it doesn't mess things up."
258,My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised daughter. Update.,"[Wow, that last post got real popular it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/), for better and for worse. Seeing as you guys got were interested in it I thought I would come back with an update. 

&#x200B;

Well, a lot has happened since that day. My daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. She is getting better every day. I know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200B;

After I made that post I took the advice given to me and the next time I saw my daughter I told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. Along with that I saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. When I went to see him he told me that this is ""A case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. I immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. I also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. He says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. Along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything I gave to him. He has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200B;

During this time, my ex started to get suspicious. Maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? Who knows. A few days later when I saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. She became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. Including telling me that I want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. She was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. After this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that I am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. This was sent to my lawyer. As he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200B;

Outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200B;

This week I received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. I have heard that the DA is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200B;

And that's really it for now. I'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. I do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. When this is all said and done, if the interest is still there I may come back again. But for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

260,"Manager told coworkers I was suicidal and a “pill popper”, I brought it up and now I have no job.","(FL, USA)

Yup, you read this crazy title correctly. Awhile back I had some major health issues and required a few surgeries to resolve things, and because of that I had to take some time off work. Management knew the situation, why I would be out and when I would return to work. One manager sent an email to my coworkers, without realizing I was also on the email chain, saying that I was in the hospital because I had popped some pills and tried to overdose and end it all; he said I may not ever come back to work, since I may not wake up. I only know this because 1) I was on the email chain and 2) MANY coworkers starting reaching out, very very concerned for me and saying they hoped I would be alright and recover. This all seemed so odd to me until I saw the email chain. I have NO clue what compelled this manager to do this, other than I know he was very mad with me taking short term medical leave, because he told me that. But being suicidal and overdosing was NOT at all true, I was just having another surgery. When I came back to work things were just awkward with coworkers, trying to explain that somehow what this manager said was not true, many people welcomed me back and said they couldn’t believe I was alive - it was just so weird. I tried ignoring it but it really made the relationship with some coworkers a bit more awkward, as they really didn’t know what to believe, because why would a manager make something like that up? When I finally had the confidence to ask some general questions about all this to the manager he was clearly annoyed, he did not want to talk about it, and oddly enough the next morning I came in I was told I no longer had a job. Even though my contract was good for another year, it was abruptly ended, after I brought up my concerns about this entire situation to this manager. I could not help but think these are somehow related. Even if they are not, and they had a legitimate reason to get rid of me and my job, what was said about my health issues, the lies that were told, I think should have never happened. And now I worry that once I leave work, what this manager could try putting in my file that may prevent me from working elsewhere in the company in the future. If they were willing to spread something so atrocious and untrue, what else would they do? I’m struggling to figure out what I should do, if anything. Do I just forget it and move on? Tell HR so that my side of the story is documented? I have the emails and numerous coworkers who would vouch for what they were told, both via email and what he said to them in person. Is there anything I can do? As I said, I just can’t shake the feeling that me asking about what transpired, and seeing how annoyed that made him, that the very next day I’m unexpectedly told my position is over and ending early....
Any advice, even if it’s not entirely legal-advice is welcome. Thanks for reading this in advance."
261,What happened to my brain damage settlement?,"When I was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car I was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. There was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. My left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. My heart ended up stopping for a while and I was revived. I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from. I'm not saying I'd ask for it back, for all I know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but I still have a right to know. How do I do that without help from my parents?

Edit: This happened in Missouri, STL.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and Ive been able to use case net to find my old case. Unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? But I do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. Specifically when I was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. I'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

But im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. Some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. Despite my head injury I'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal UN-serial killer life. Thank you."
262,"[Update] I allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say I kidnapped her to avoid child support (CT to NY)","Update of my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200B;

So, I had my day in court today for the child support hearing. Dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. My sister (let's call her Valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but I'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because I could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

The judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that Valerie is now 18 and in CT would be ineligible but in NY would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

Dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of Valerie and that Mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  Then he said how Valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that Mom never speaks to him about anything, that I make no effort to have a relationship with him and that Valerie doesn't either. Boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  Sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""Why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

He then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. At that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, I piped up and asked as calmly as I could manage ""Why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at Mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

My mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if I could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. Valerie was 17 at the time she moved to NYS and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and I've been her sole source of support ever since. 

The judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. My mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. Dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. The judge asked me what amount I was looking for. My answer was that I just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so I asked for a total of $250 from Dad and the max $50 from Mom. Dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). The judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and I held firm on $250. Dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

The judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 AND I never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

Thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for Dad's intimidation tactics.

263,My ex has a restraining order against me and now lives in the same apartment complex,"My Ex Wife and I had a rocky marriage, my alcoholism didn't help. She pushed for a divorce.  We lived together during this divorce and one day I found out she was dating another man. I snapped and hit her, pretty hard. I was charged with assault, spent 3 months in jail, went to anger management and I was also issued a 3 yr restraining order.

&#x200B;

This was 2 yrs ago. I have since sobered up, met a wonderful woman and moved to a completely different apartment complex in a completely different part of the city and never had any further contact with my Ex Wife. I admit what I did was wrong, I paid the price, I've seen re-established myself. My current woman who I've been in a relationship with for 2 yrs is aware of this back ground story (which makes things slightly easier)

&#x200B;

Well unknown to me my ex moved into my apartment complex about 5 months ago with her now new husband (who had always lived here, I did not know this) I saw her in the lobby just before new years. She greeted me, I turned shocked and said hello. She asked me what I was doing in the lobby I said I was just coming in from work she told me that the restraining order is still in effect and I need to move out.

&#x200B;

I tried to reason with her and told her I'd be happy to steer clear of her, I know we don't live on the same floor (I don't even know what floor she lives on, I don't care to know) I told her if I saw her on an elevator I wouldn't get in and just wait for the next one. She told me she was going enforce the restraining order against me.

&#x200B;

My partner and I literally just signed a brand new 2 yr lease 6 months ago. We love the place we live in, and wouldn't want to move. And it feels unjust having to move/incur financial hardship because the person I had a restraining order against moved into my apartment complex. 

&#x200B;

The reason why I'm bringing this up is cause last night building management was informed of the restraining order and told us we need to figure this out.

&#x200B;

Would she really be able to force me out of my home even though I lived here before her? As long as I do my best to avoid any contact with her (which I'm perfectly fine doing) shouldn't that be sufficient? I work a really early schedule and the fact is she was dating this guy and coming over to this apartment complex for the entire time I've been here, and we ran crossed paths, and she's been living here full time for 5 months and just recently crossed paths. Not sure what to do.

  
FYI this is New York City"
264,UPDATE: My dad's house is serviced by a community well that is now owned by an HOA..,"Hi all I wanted to update on the outcome of this.  Sorry, it's honestly a pretty boring outcome - no cool courtroom outbursts at all sadly.  It turns out there were just some liars and there was never actually a legal problem in the first place, my dad was just the victim of the HOA trying to scam him.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gijkoz/iowa_my_dads_house_is_serviced_by_a_community/) is my original thread. The summary is that my dad lives in a house served by a community well that is next to an HOA (but my dad is not part of it).  The HOA told my dad that they now own the well and that he needs to join the HOA and effectively pay them $800/mo to use the well service plus the actual water bill on top of it.

He did end up getting a lawyer to see him ASAP. The lawyer told him the first thing he needed to do was get records of ownership for the well and try to get his hands on the details of the sale. However after a couple days he said he was having issues getting up to date records and was waiting to hear back from a contact at the county because he wasn't sure if COVID had delayed records filing or what.

Then my dad got a surprise: a water bill from the original well servicer, right on time for their 3-times-a-year billing. Obviously that's odd considering he's been told that they don't own the well anymore, and he called them up.

It turns out he was just lied to. The well servicer was never looking to get out of the well business permanently, but rather was looking to contract out the day-to-day testing services of the well to another company because many of the wells they service now require more testing than they did years ago and they no longer have the manpower to do all of it themselves.  But they were not selling the well, simply hiring an independent contractor to drive around and do well stuff all day.

During that time the HOA had asked them to attend an HOA meeting so residents could ask questions about things like filtration, and they mentioned it at that meeting to let residents know that they would be seeing a new person going around doing testing and wanted to let them know because the testing involves taking samples from individual properties and they didn't want anyone to be freaked out.

So when the HOA told my dad they now owned the well, they were just plain lying. When the HOA said they had a new company doing the servicing, they were half truthful: a new company was doing the testing, but the HOA had nothing to do with it, the contract is between the original well servicer and the individual guy they're contracting out to.

The original well servicer also told my dad that the HOA had reached out and informed them around the same time they were contacting my dad, that they were taking over handling billing, and that the well servicer should bill the HOA for all properties and the HOA would then include it in the HOA dues billing to ""streamline"" things for residents claiming it would make their residents' lives easier if they only had to keep track of one bill and not multiple. However the HOA actually has no authority to just declare this and the well servicer just outright told them no, they will continue to bill individual properties.  The timing of this coincides with when they started contacting my dad, so they were just trying to pull a fast one on everyone.

The well servicer is confident that the HOA has 0 legal authority over the well situation and says they respected the HOA in an organizational capacity, like calling meetings so residents could ask questions, and were professionally annoyed with them trying to insert themselves into billing, but they were not aware that the HOA was claiming to own the well. They told my dad that he should not give the HOA any money for water servicing or accept water servicing related information from them in any way.

So going back around to the lawyer, my dad got an appointment with the lawyer to tell him all this and the lawyer had his own news that matched up entirely: The reason he wasn't finding up to date records following the supposed sale was because he doesn't believe a legitimate sale has happened, he thinks my dad was just getting scammed.

So all in all my dad will continue to use the well as he always has.  He is pretty angry that he had to spend a bunch of money to find out what he already knew, that the HOA is made of dicks, but we are definitely breathing a sigh of relief.

Meanwhile as for the HOA my father's lawyer has suggested that there may be room for legal action against the HOA reps for what was basically fraudulent claims. My father doesn't want to spend the money persuing it at this time, but the well servicer did ask for copies of everything he received from the HOA because they want to review it with their own lawyer.

Thanks to everyone who gave advice - we're grateful for it and also for the fact that we didn't have to use most of it, ha ha!"
265,"Landlord claimed me (adult, have rent receipts) as dependent and received my stimulus","Washington State, US. Rent was paid by check, Social Security number for me apparently taken from lease agreement.

Edit: Woke up to tons of responses thank you.

NOT disabled or even related to landlord. No care involved. Former landlord, not subsidized etc. Living elsewhere for a year now.

UPDATE: Wow did not expect this response, cannot thank you all enough. Trying to answer a few questions.

Concerning eviction/retaliation, I have not lived at the rental residence for a year now. I was in fact homeless and living in a tent for 7 months of last year and am only recently in assisted housing thanks to my state's Department of Social and Health Services. It took time, but I jumped through all the hoops and they deemed me worthy of housing assistance.  I could not be more thankful.

I know she (former landlord) had filed me as a dependent as she admitted as much via text message. She claimed then (2 months ago) that she would correct it but has not as far as I can tell.

The housing was not assisted at that time and my mother was kind enough to pay for my rent for 5 months before I moved outside waiting for housing to come through. Paid by check. I have the copies.

How do I live on $200 month? Not very well. I recently bought underwear for the first time in years. I had to save up for it. My internet is 9.95/month through a low income program. My cel phone is free service also through low income program. I live at the grace of the state for now.

Not only was the landlord not a caregiver, but I cooked, did yard work, took care of the cats etc. She is 70.

Thank you again for all the information. I am starting with a hard copy tax return for last year and will go from there.

266,US citizen cousin (16F) is abroad and under heavy pressure to get married by parents. She asked for my help. [Update: We helped her & she's here],"First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7h34dk/us_citizen_cousin_16f_is_abroad_and_under_heavy/

Thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

My sister and I contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in Karachi. They were able to verify that she exists and she's a US citizen. We told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

The challenge was getting her into the consulate in Karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the US. We bought tickets for her to go from Karachi to Doha and then to Boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

By the time her parents realized what's what she was on the Doha to Boston flight. Her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the US but their visa applications were refused. I'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

She currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. Her priority is to learn English. 

Her parents still try to somehow make her return but we've closed down the lines of communication and hopefully her life from now on will be stress-free. "
267,"Accidentally 'drink and dashed' yesterday, would it be stupid of me to go back today and pay the tab? (EU)","So there's this bar me and my bf semi-regularly go to, recently they changed the way they serve drinks. You used to have to go to the counter, order, they gave you your drink, you paid then and there, done. Now they have a server who goes to your table and it all works like in a restaurant. Except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. This morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

I know morally going back and paying is the right choice. But what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? Because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if I go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should I go back and pay our tab?

Edit: this all happened in Eastern Europe, part of the EU.

Update: I felt really guilty so I went back there around opening hours. They were extremely above and beyond nice about it. Apologized and explained the situation. They said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. I'm pretty sure we didn't pay so I insisted, but they were like ""Don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" Tbh I'm so embarrassed I probably won't go back there for a long while, but I am glad I tried to do the right thing.

Thanks for all the advice."
268,My high school is saying that I dropped out of school almost 13 years after I graduated and received a high school diploma. Is there any legal recourse?,"I graduated high school in Oklahoma, 2007. Hands shook, congratulations given, diploma awarded, and sent on my way. Shortly after completing school I joined the military and I’ve worked for the gov’t on some level ever since. Recently, I decided it was time to tackle some higher education. While contacting my old school to get transcripts sent over to the college I was informed that the transcripts indicate that I dropped out of school. “Nonsense!”, I tell them. “I have a diploma from the school!” The lady on the other line seemed as confused as I was. I emailed her pictures of the diploma, and was assured that the principal and superintendent of the district were taking it seriously and looking into it. The next day I received an email that said something like, “Supporting documents that accompany your transcript get destroyed after 5-7 years, so this is going to be tough, but we’ll continue to look into it.”

Not really the response I was hoping for, but I guess at very least they’re “looking into it”.

The other day I filed a complaint with the department of education, but I would really like options on what legal standing I have. This whole thing could have a ripple effect through my life in some pretty catastrophic ways, as well as being emotionally exhausting. It’s hard to imagine calling up your school nearly 13 years after leaving and hearing them tell you that you dropped out and that you’re not a high school graduate, even though you clearly did not, and nothing was said to you about it in over a decade, but take my word for it, it feels terrible.

Update: For those confused about college acceptance without a verifiable HS transcripts, I was told I could still enroll, but as a non degree seeking student, for only a set amount of hours, I believe. As far as the military goes, at the moment, I have requested all my paperwork on VETRECS and my transcripts to not show, only DD-214, Evals, medical reports, etc. AFVEC only appears to have my CCAF data, of which I have only completed 37 credit hours. I will call the recruiting station I went through tomorrow to see if they have access to records. 

As far as names are concerned, it shouldn’t be an issue. There where 95 students in my graduating class and not a single other person with either my first or last name.

Update #2: I have called the recruiting command who I enlisted with after high school. They confirmed they have my diploma, but not my transcripts.

Update #3: The college has excepted my high school diploma, but still waiting to see if my job will accept me into an accredited management training program without them."

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z8ei4/sold_townhouse_a_year_later_ac_goes_out_new_owner/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I know only a handful of people will read this but I figured why not do an update. 

We were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the AC unit. The case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

What was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. Almost to the point of self righteousness. The way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. Additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. His lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. Oh well. It's over.

270,update - Colorado - What do I do with my house? Just leave the keys on the counter?,"I want to thank everyone for the advise on my last post and to give a brief update.  I spoke to an attorney about it and she started looking into it.  First thing she said is that I am still the owner and that the eviction process was never completed.  She also told me there's still a lien on the house, which is where it gets interesting.  

My mortgage was ultimately sold to a 2nd mortgage company which no longer exists.  The 2nd mortgage company that had my mortgage was absorbed by a 3rd company, which went bankrupt and collapsed.  Because I've been maintaining the property and paying property taxes, coupled with no leinholder asserting their rights she believes she can get the leinholder removed from the title.

So as it turns out, I may end up owning my home free and clear after all.  Unfortunately she doesn't know how long everything will take, so I don't anticipate an update for a while, but thank you all!"

272,I was filmed against my consent at a party. (UPDATE),"[Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

History: Myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. In a private villa where expected things to be private. A pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. I asked if we have legal options against the person.

We went to the police. Myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. They didn't. They said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

It sucked. I didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone I know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

BUT this didn't end there. This perv didn't stop. He tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. They got him and handed him over to the police. So he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. They took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

He's now locked up. Our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

It took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

273,Coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if I don't have sex with him.,"So a guy I know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. I thought I had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but I guess he somehow found the video. We work in the finance industry and I do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. The guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

This is also because I went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

So, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, I'll just call myself H, he found revenge porn of me online. At first I was relieved that it was him cause I've known him for so many years and thought I could trust him. Then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. Horrified I push him away. He then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if I come over to his place and have sex with him. Other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

We're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. That day I just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

He's told me that I should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. Over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

I feel so betrayed, since I thought we were good friends. and I'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. I've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

If anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

Tl;Dr- Coworker found revenge porn of me online. He's been sexually harassing me and Is threatening to share it if I don't have sex with him.

Edit- Many people are telling me to go to the police. It's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. He is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. He's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone I know if I don't have sex with him. 
Also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. I'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

274,I think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare [x-post from /r/parenting],"Originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested I post here... Edit per bot request: we are in California.

My son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. At the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because I needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

He seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.

I'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""I don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

We had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! But cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! Pretzels now!"". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". My husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (We only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

My husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

I've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.

Are we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


Edit:

First, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. We are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. We are also very grateful for all of the advice.

Second, an update. Our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. We didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. We'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. I have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

This morning my husband called CPS and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. Next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. The school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. Finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). We met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. When she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. Without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  As frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). As many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. The social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. We were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. If anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

I think that covers everything that happened today. My husband had to go back to work so I've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. If there are any developments, I'll update again, but that is it for now.

Thank you again for everything, Reddit. You truly came through in our time of need ❤️

"
275,Neighbor has left her 6yo daughter with me for 4 days. How to proceed?,"Let me break it down in bullet points.

\- I live in a building that has a mixture of regular and subsidized housing. About a year ago, a young mother moved in next door with her daughter. I am a 40yo man, working from home through Covid. She has confided in me that she struggles with heroin addiction, but was getting clean. I lent a kind ear and gave her a few bucks here and there. I have no interest in exploiting her. Dad is completely out of the picture. Grandparents too.

\- It started with her just 'running to the store' and leaving her child with me. That was fine. We set up a little play area and she is happy/quiet cute little girl with a good imagination.

\- There were times when she would go out and wouldn't come back for several hours. This escalated to a few times leaving her overnight. I've converted my office into a bedroom and got a bed from Craigslist. I always make sure she has breakfast, lunch, dinner and take her to the park or to the beach. Mom never compensated me, and the way she talks, it sometimes makes it sound like she's doing me a favor.

\- The thing is, I've always kind of wanted a kid but never got around to it. We have bonded. I think that this is most love and structure this girl has gotten her entire life. I've enrolled her in school this fall, which is online learning. I was able to get her social security and health information. I'm university educated and we have structured learning time. She is incredibly bright. I've also looked into getting her enrolled in dance, since she has shown an interest.

\- Mom hasn't been back in 4 days. I contacted the LL and apparently she hasn't paid rent in 3 months. Her phone has been disconnected as well.

\- I know I should contact child services, but she has grown so attached I know it would break her heart. We would both be heartbroken to have her taken away and put into the system."
276,Wedding photographer has been giving us the run around for 4 months. Informed us today she lost all of our images.,"I am in West Virginia. 


What on earth can I do? My wife is devestated. The photographer has lied and made excuses every couple of weeks with moving deadlines and “I sent it last week you didn’t get them?” 

We received our sneak peak, which was only like 25 pictures, but it didn’t include any pictures of the bride and her family. 

I understand a refund is a given, even though she has not offered it. (She offered a free family shoot... get the fuck out of here.)

Is there legal recourse on getting more than our refund back due to the impact this will cause and the fact we will NEVER have pictures of our wedding day?

Even the refund is going to have to go to court, I feel. The photographer made sure to mention in the apology message that she is “working 3 jobs and falling behind just trying to make ends meet.”


Edit:: hey guys. Too many replies to acknowledge. I have reached out to a lawyer. As many of you have implied, there is definitely more to this story. Something just isn’t right but I don’t know what happened on her side of things. 

She has made so many excuses along the way. She even claimed at one point that she mailed the usb drive(it never came) and when we told her it never arrived, she claimed she would have to do the work all over again but she would ASAP.

She was young and fairly cheap, but not like $200 cheap. It was around $1000 total. 

Everything has felt off the whole way (after the wedding that is. She was great that whole time) , but I never expected this 

She claims that this morning she was trying to make us a new jump drive and that’s when she realized that JUST LAST NIGHT her whole system corrupted and she most all her files for the last year. All of her projects for all of her clients. It sounded pretty insane to me, and after reading other professionals comments here, I can see it is.

277,"[ON CA] Mother was living in a condo I purchased. Upon her death her new husband (and his family) expect me to transfer ownership to him because ""he owns it"".","While I am not wealthy, by any means, I have been investing my extra income for many years now. As my mother was on the verge of becoming homeless some years ago, I decided to use income generated from other properties to finance a condo for her in a retirement community. She was single at the time and the verbal agreement was that she could stay there as long as she needed but she had to pay for the utilities and condo fees.

A few years ago, she married a man who promptly moved in with her. I've had a strained relationship with my mother for many years and while this man seemed nice enough, we never became close. Before they got married, they sent a note to me and my siblings stating that the marriage wouldn't change how their assets were split up upon their deaths (e.g. his kids would get his stuff and her kids would get her stuff). My siblings and I didn't care either way and just wanted her to be happy (even though she was basically estranged from all of us at that point).

Early this fall, my mother passed away. My siblings and I all did what was expected during this difficult time but it was made clear to us that the new husband was running the show. After that took place, I decided that I would wait a month or so before telling the new husband that he needed to find a new place to live as I was going to be selling the condo. Before any of this could happen though, I got a very angry call from the husband about why I was listed as the owner of my mother's residence. I tried explaining what the reality of the matter was but he was having none of it. Things have now escalated to the point that his kids are calling and sending me quasi-threatening emails.

In the last communication, they stated that my ownership of the condo is fraudulent because my mother had been making the payments on it for all these years and I tricked her into signing it over to me when it was first purchased.

Do I have anything to worry about? I'm not very confrontational but I will stand up for myself and what's right when push comes to shove. I won't be able to sell the place until it is empty which means evicting this guy but that will likely get him even more riled up which I would like to avoid if at all possible.

Thanks in advance."

279,[CT]. Cops keep showing up to home around 10:30PM-12AM looking for past tenant,"This has happened a few times but I work overnight so I’m usually not home around the time they come. I was home the past two times they showed up. First time, it was only two cops. Of course they knocked really hard and I live in a small community so it woke everyone up. 

Last night, I counted five cops coming to my door at approximately 11:47 PM, banging my door down, “POLICE OPEN UP”. I jump out of bed and open the door. They don’t even have a warrant to search my home. Ask for “XX”. I say “he is the past tenant I’ve been here for x amount of months! I tell you guys this every time. Ask my landlord if you don’t believe it. Or come back with a warrant to check yourself!”  

It’s becoming very disruptive for myself and my neighbors. I do not know my options. I’m young and alone with no friends or family so I do not know what to do. Any help is appreciated"
280,"[Update][ON CA] Mother was living in a condo I purchased.

Some people have asked for an update so I thought I would provide one.

I ended up retaining the services of an attorney and this seems to have been the linchpin needed to get the wheels turning in my favour. Some time in mid January, my lawyer was notified that the condo would be vacated before the end of the month and they even turned over the keys through the building superintendent. 

The condo was messy / dirty but nothing was damaged. A good cleaning and some fresh paint made everything look as good as new.

The condo fees were last paid for December so I had to get that taken care of once I got the locks changed. In the end, I will be out a few months condo fees and the cost of the attorney. There are some issues with the utilities which are i) still in my mother's name and ii) in arrears by a few months but I'm told this will all be resolved quickly (and I won't have to pay for the outstanding portions).

With any luck, the unit will be sold by the end of this month (thank you hot real estate market).

Lessons learned from this ordeal; i) get everything in writing even when it's with family and ii) when push comes to shove, walk away and hire a lawyer!"
281,"Drunk driver drove through my friends house, almost killing her. 6 months later she has no compensation and is struggling to afford to live.","As the title says, 6 months ago it was 3am in British Columbia Canada and my friend was asleep in bed in her house she owns. A 19 year old drunk driver plowed into her house. The car went through the ground floor and she is lucky to be alive (the car demolished her bed side table, missing her bed by inches). The car couldn’t be moved for almost a month because the house may have fallen down due to how much damage it caused. My friend shared the house with her brother and disabled mother, who she is a full time career to, on top of working as a teacher.

6 months later, my friend has had no compensation. She has spent all of her life savings dealing with the repercussions. She is still paying the mortgage on her place which is completely unliveable, as well as rent on a temporary 2 bedroom place for her an her mother to live. She is having to pay contractors herself to fix the house. All of this is incredibly expensive in Vancouver Canada. She is a single salary teacher and is now having to borrow money from me in order to get by. If she didn’t have friends to support her, it’s very feasible her and her mother could be made homeless from this. The financial burden as well as the mental stress from nearly dying and then being displaced whilst having to look after her wheelchair bound mother is monumental.

The kid who drove the car is lawyered up to the eyeballs. The insurance company (ICBC) is being incredibly unhelpful, due to it being a drunk driving incident. The insurance company sent a representative to meet with my friend (I was present) and the rep admitted that, had the kid not been drunk, they would have paid out compensation quickly. Because it’s a drunk driving case they are saying the kids insurance is invalid and aren’t willing to pay out quickly to my friend.

My friend has met with a couple of lawyers (I wasn’t present) and in her words, they said she has a clear case but didn’t think they should take the case as they would charge 30% fee and they may not be necessary. This is the bit I’m unsure of, as 6 months down the line she has only been offered menial amounts by the insurance company (a couple of $1500 cheque’s, she hasn’t cashed) and her and her wheelchair bound mother are struggling to make ends meet.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I feel like this case is pretty specific to ICBC, (a particularly poorly run insurance company with a monopoly in British Columbia. Recently ICBC tried to wrongly blame the death of a police officer that was killed by a drunk driver, on the the dead police officer... just to give you a taste of how they operate)

*EDIT* 
First of all I want to say thank you everyone for all the advice, it is massively appreciated! I am currently travelling back to canada and haven’t had time to go through all of this but it seems the biggest question is regarding her home owners insurance... I need to speak to my friend to confirm but from what I remember she certainly has home owners insurance, she has attempted to get them involved but they have also been very unhelpful. They have said they won’t pay for certain things in the house, saying that even though it was destroyed, the place is over 10 years old and so the valuations are ridiculously low. They have also tried to shift the responsibility to ICBC. My friend has set up meetings with 5 different lawyers to get one of them involved ASAP. Honestly everyone, I’m blown away by all this help! Thank you. I will go though all the messages once I get back to Vancouver tomorrow and respond as needed."
282,"[Update] Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

Just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. The last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

I have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

My condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. Apparently there were noise complaints on Friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. Our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

On Sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were AirBnB tenants, and they said yes. He then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

Jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. She also stated that she will be going to the LTB to ""make a formal complaint because banning AirBnB is not allowed"". When i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. She went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

I have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. I asked a friend to book my room for one night through AirBnB for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment."
283,(OK) Mom passed away and things aren't adding up.,"[Update]

The last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  I kinda feel like I'm living in one of those crime novels. At one point, I seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility I might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

I obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but I do want to let everyone know I have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired FBI agent with a LOT of connections. As of today, I have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. I also have been granted access to her property.  A lot of things are missing.  The vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which I'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

Thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. I will never be able to express the amount of gratitude I have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. You guys are amazing!!

To those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...I hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. When you do, think of me.




I'm not really sure what to make of all this and I could really use some insight on the matter. Evidently my mom passed away last Wednesday June 5th...I say evidently because my brother and I weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

I'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and I'm afraid if I try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but I feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

We first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (See...weird huh?) He claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) She told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

My mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while I'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and I wasn't even aware he had my number. He immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last Wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. They supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. Then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and I, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend Sheriff Whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and HIS attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to Salvation Army. He was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

How is that even possible? Can he do that? I mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and I are required to attend? Is this how this stuff goes down? I really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? Never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and I can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. But my feelings aside what is the legal process here? How could I find out for certain if there even is a will? 

The situation gets a little crazier because after I called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and I are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming Wednesday because he has meetings all day Tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. To my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

This makes me think there is no will. If there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and I were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

I'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

The most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, I know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  She reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...I'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

Isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? Is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? Or even if they don't?? Sorry for the long post. I'm still trying to understand all of this. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. Who should I contact first? The police in her area? An attorney? What do I do?

Update: I can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. No I haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. He and I are getting together today to get a lawyer. This is in fact very real and I'm not making it up at all. I created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. My brother and I are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  As far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. All I can tell you is, sorry I didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. I guess I'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, I'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me."
284,I run a small artisanal fruit farm in France. American Tiktok influencers destroyed approximately 15% of my crop. Can I prosecute people in a different country?,"As per title, I operate a small fruit farm in France that specialises in rare and luxury oranges and other citrus fruits. These are produced in VERY small numbers, and are sold for very high prices to private buyers, restaurants, and upmarket hotels.

About 2-3 months ago about 15% of my crop had been sliced, squashed, crushed and left to rot on the ground. I liaised with local police at the time, but no one knew what had happened. The police suspected local vandals or perhaps migrants travelling North searching for some food. We have had several groups of people head towards Calais over the past few years. If the latter was the case I wouldn't have begrudged them taking some fruit. Refugees deserve to eat.

This morning I was linked to a video on Tiktok showing an American woman on my farm picking a citrus fruit off the tree, cutting it open and crushing it in her hand so the juices flowed out. Upon investigation there are approximately 4 accounts posting similar content from my farm.

It appears that they had been repeatedly squeezing my fruits trying to get a perfect shot as a girl can be seen in the background of one of the videos squeezing a fruit before lowering her camera and picking another from the tree.

Without getting into specific numbers I have suffered thousands of Euros in lost product, and thousands more from breaching contracts with hotels RE the supply of fruit.

Can I, as a European, prosecute American citizens for damages?

After having balls narrowly miss hitting young children we no longer feels safe sitting outside during the day. We can't even use the back half of our property during business hours at all.

We have complained to the owner a half dozen times and he has made a lot of promises but never followed through with any of them. Other residents are very unhappy with the owner as he is very difficult and never follows through with anything he says he is going to do.

Am I obligated to send him new ones?,"My landlord of six years ago sent me a letter with photocopies of old checks I had sent him. According to him, he forgot to cash said checks and is requesting new ones. There are several checks and the total amount is not insignificant.

I'm in a fairly tight spot myself at the moment handling a mortgage, house repairs, etc. I don't see how I could pay back the requested amount without causing undue stress on myself.

Can my former landlord pursue legal action against me? Is there some sort of statute of limitations on this?

EDIT:
I went to the bank and they confirmed with me all checks were cashed and gave me printouts stating as such. Thank you very much for your advice."
289,"[Update, California] Sister held against her will in a hotel room by her ex-boyfriend under threat of death. Hotel wanted her to pay for damages sustained during his arrest before they'd release her belongings. They also confiscated our mother's wallet and phone to use as leverage","Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/il4roj/sister_was_held_against_her_will_in_a_hotel_room/

Found out my sister contacted the police about this last night and whoever spoke with her brushed the entire ordeal off as a ""small claims court"" matter which disheartened her and my mother.

Following the suggestions from the thread, today we spoke with the deputy who was the first contact with my sister about this entire situation and he escalated it to his superior. The deputies then went to the hotel to set the manager straight. They essentially told him that he can't keep the belongings as leverage and that he'd have to pursue damages properly in civil court.

The hotel staff were very nice and understanding, but the manager's entire demeanor was extremely hostile and unprofessional. Apparently he was very rude to the officers. I did not like the way he spoke to his staff.

But we got their stuff back without any major further hassles.

Thank you everyone for your suggestions. We are also pursuing additional resources/assistance/counseling for her as a domestic violence victim going forward. She is in contact with a case manager from the local women's shelter."
290,TX - My pregnant ex girlfriend is told several lies about me and got me arrested. Kid was born and turns out not my kid. She just called me.,"Ex was a one night stand with no protection. She gets pregnant and we assume its mine. 

Things go to shit and we break up. Talk of custody and child support comes up and I tell her I was going to try for custody.

Three hours later I am picked up for questioning. I refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out I have a restraining order against me. 

The kid is born. DNA test is done and its not mine. 

Since all of this started I have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because CYA has literally saved my job. 

I just got a phone call from an unknown number. It was my ex. She said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. I told her we should not be talking. She agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

I immediately hung up the phone. I have her on recording admitting to false Rape reports to the police. 

Will I get in trouble for this? I made no effort to call her and she called me. The call lated 1:28 seconds and I hung up on her. 

Second question. What are the chances of using this recording to get restraining order dropped?

Third. What are the chances that Dallas police will arrest her for the false claim?"
291,Someone Threatened to Kill me at the Gym,"I live in Brooklyn.

I was going to the gym and returned what looked like a forgotten phone to the desk.

The man came looking for his phone and I told him I brought it to the front desk.

He became EXTREMELY agitated and demanded me to go get it.

When I said no, he became more enraged and threatened to beat me up.

He threatened to kill me several times.

He broke my headphones and when I approached the front desk for help he snapped my phone in half.

He threatened me several times and said he would kill me/snap my neck like the phone.

No one at the gym batted an eye, said anything or helped.

He never punched me, because I reminded him of the cameras and the police, but he was extremely imposing and like I said did threaten to assault me several times per minute.

&#x200B;

My question is should I go to the cops?

I just don't know if the Brooklyn police will do anything and I am worried that he or his friends would actually assault me should I go to the police. 

I am also worried that the front desk might give away my information to him since he is a long time member. I think they only have my credit card info, but still.

I have what I believe to be his first name."
292,What will happen to 40k savings after my death? Terminally ill at 17,"Basically, im terminally ill. Im going to die most likely within the next +- 12 months.
Im 17. I have saved up 40k (LEGAL money) throughout my life. 
I want my mom and dad to receive 50/50 of the money. 
Do i need to sign some contract to make sure it happens or does the bank automatically split the money between my parents? (Its my own account, neither are co owners).
I cant ask my parents on it, since they are in denial that im dying and refuse to talk about anything relating the fact that im dying. 
Also what about life insurance? Is it possible for me/my parents to take a life insurance on me even though its a official fact that im dying? 
I want to give them as much as i can after my death, because i know that my mom wont be able to work after my death.
Advice pls?"
293,(Texas) Power of attorney seems fishy?,"So, I'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time I try to, they threaten me with this. I do have mental disabilities, however I am fully functional and I also have never been diagnosed. This leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. I do remember my parents dragging me into an SSA office when I was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. They just told me to sign it without question and being my parents I didn't think to question them. Later they told me that I had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. Every time I try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since I'm disabled and I have no guardianship over myself, whoever I go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. I'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. They tell me I'm crazy and helpless and I can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200B;

Other things that might be important that make my question things:

They don't care about my well being. They don't allow me to go to therapy even when I've asked. They refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when I finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. I know for sure I do have a mental disability, I just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. They've always been controlling and I wonder if this is just another method. I get too scared to call Suicide Hotline when I'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" I've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and I have a hard time seeking help. I feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how do I go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? What are their rights if this is true? What are my rights? Can I, I guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? What can I do about this?

&#x200B;

Is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that I haven't thought about asking for? Can I do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? Can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200B;

I should also I add they sabotage any jobs I try to work because of the POA thing. I currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and I'm not on any official payroll that I know of. Is this also legal????

&#x200B;

I have so many questions and I feel so helpless and lost. I'm sorry. 

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance"
294,Ancestor donated land to a college with a stipulation that his descendants can attend for free with proceeds from donation,"One of my ancestors donated money and land to a college in MA, in his will, with the stipulation that ""any of his kin"" can attend for free with proceeds from the donation given they are accepted with their own merit.  The will is dated way more than a 100 years ago, but the college is still active with one of their building named after this man.

My grandmother always talked about this when I was younger (her maiden name is the same as this man), but me nor any of the family gave it any thought. Years later, after the internet became a thing, we were contacted by a distant relative doing research into the family background. After a lot of research I managed to find a copy of the will online and save it. 

I am wondering if this is something worth pursuing for my son(2)? If so, where do I start? What kind of lawyer would even specialize in this? We live in MI"

296,Employer lured me with an offer letter that has terms that are impossible to meet.,"I graduated from pharmacy school in June of 2018 and I was hired by a pharmacy chain to work in California. I went to school in a nearby state and had to move for this job. 

My offer letter says that I have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. It is NOT possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in California. The process takes about 4 months. I was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

I moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in October. I was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. The schedule is for several weeks ahead. I brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. I was told that I MIGHT get more hours at some point if I learn to work more efficiently.

I pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. He says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. He also said that the offer letter was void because I didn't get licensed within 90 days. He said that if I work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

Is he correct about all this? I went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 I don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. The board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

297,My girlfriend is being harassed by her coworker over the coronavirus.,"My girlfriend has lupus and asthma. One day about a week ago she had trouble breathing and it got bad enough an ambulance came out and gave her a breathing treatment. Since then her coworker who is an older woman has been causing scenes at work about her even when she's nowhere near her. Accusing her of putting everyone at risk, and refusing to go where she's been. The manager sent her coworker home one day because she wouldn't stop. Today she found out her coworker called the CDC and reported her and has been trying to get other employees on board to get rid of my girlfriend. My girlfriend shows no symptoms. Because of her condition she already took tons of steps to stay clean and healthy so we were already prepared when all this started. It has been extremely hard on her since she already hates being in the condition she's in. Is there anything we can do?


Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. As of now she's filed a report with the store manager for harassment. Being a small company they don't have HR so from there there owner will be involved. Apparently they're saying the store is considered disaster relief so they are not shutting down. I will be talking to her about still taking time off though I know she's afraid of losing her job and or not being able to keep up with bills but we'll make it happen. Thanks guys!"
298,Planet Fitness lied...,"
Question for you guys. 

So I moved out of state but before I left I went into Planet Fitness to cancel my gym membership, signed the paper and everything. I  noticed like 3 months later that they had still been debiting my bank account, so I called my bank who said they had my account/routing number and they would block future debits and refund it. 

A month later I noticed that they had billed me AGAIN for the 3 months plus a fee. So I called my bank again who said this time they used my debit card and would refund the money and open a fraud dispute, since I cancelled it and did not permit these debits. 

Just today I got a notice of legal action from my bank with documents from Planet Fitness saying that I had never cancelled my membership, and said I went to the gym on March 6, 2020 at 12:30pm and sent a picture of me walking in dated on March 6, 2020. Mind you I have been out of state since November and the picture showed me with very short hair and I have had extensions since September 2019, they sent an old pic and are lying about me checking in. I have proof I was at work in a different state that day they claim the picture was taken. 

I am pretty positive it’ll get figured out with the bank, but my question is how could I let people know publicly about this fraudulent company without getting sued for slander or something. Also, could I sue them for blatantly lying?? 

TYIA!

Edit: Thanks for all the responses!! I absolutely have proof of all kinds on my credit card, being at work that day in another state, everything. I didn’t get a paper from the girl who did it, who seemed annoyed in the first place. But being that they now blatantly lied and I have evidence of that, their case wouldn’t stand either way. They even mailed it to my parents house, which hasn’t been my address for 7 months, and my mom was furious haha. I never thought to contact the attourney general and make sure they don’t get to keep doing this! Thanks all."
299,I think my landlord may be dead or hospitalized and I don't know what to do,"I will have been in this rental property for 10 years this year. In all that time, I've never actually met my land lord. He lives in another state. He used to have properties both in my state and in his state, but after the recession in 08 he mostly pulled everything back to his state. My original lease was for the first year here, after that we never signed another lease but we've never had any issues at all about that.

I've always paid the rent by making a deposit directly to his account at his bank. When anything goes wrong, he's quick to hire repairmen. We've had a good relationship for the last decade, even if we don't know what the other looks like in person.

Cue coronavirus. My SO and myself both work in the hospitality industry, and restaurant\bars have been shut down for a month now with no clear end in sight. Unemployment hasn't kicked in yet and we haven't gotten any stimulus check. Rent is due, but we wanted to talk to our landlord about postponing payments until we started working again.

The landlord's phone goes straight to voicemail. The voicemail box is full Everytime we call. He hasn't responded to texts or emails. We've been trying to get s hold of him for over 2 weeks now. 

Although I've never seen him, he sounds like an older dude and I'm worried about him. I'm also worried about my household. 

What happens if he's not okay? I can provide other details if they might be helpful.

Edit: My state is Florida. Landlord lives in Kentucky. At least, I hope he still does

Edit II: I found the property tax information and it only lists his middle initial and a PO box for my state and county.

Edit III: thanks to a lot of help, some info has been tracked down and I have an address that I'm pretty sure is my land Lords actual house (not just a PO box that might not be checked often). I'm going to send a certified letter over that way explaining my situation and proposing a payment plan for deferred rent. In the mean time, I'm going to keep as much money put aside as possible until I get cash coming in again, when payments will be resumed.

I'll let you guys know if I hear back.
Thank you to everyone who provided advice.

FINAL EDIT: he's okay!!! His cellphone got stolen and he's still waiting on a replacement. Probably the best possible outcome, I think.

Thanks again to everyone who reached out with resources and offers to help."
300,Ex girlfriend says she will never stop suing,"My boyfriend left his ex-girlfriend almost 2 years ago. They were together for about 5 years with no children together.  They had just purchased a home together in the U.S. and have been going to court for a year and a half over it.  He paid for almost everything,  so the court  said they must sell the house and awarded him a much higher percentage of the proceeds. She appealed on the grounds that the judge was unfair to her as a single mother (she had a 24 year old son)  and although we are still waiting to hear back,  it sounds like the court will probably stand by their original decision.  All this really did was prolong this ordeal. 
She emailed my boyfriend a few days ago and basically told him that because she can't keep the  house, she is going to sue him for multiple reasons after they finish this round. Although I don't think she will win anything, we really can't afford to keep paying a lawyer to represent him for another year or two.  He has already paid over 20k and we just can't do this much longer.   
My question is,  can she just sue him over and over? How do we handle this? His lawyer honestly has not been overly helpful.

301,"[Alabama] Tailgated by police for 3 minutes, then searched and ticketed for going 56 in 55","  

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over. They search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. I ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that I don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

They didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

Not sure if this is legally relevant, but I'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. I also had an LSU sticker on the back of my car.

Is there anything I can do regarding this, or do I just chalk it up as part of the Alabama experience and just fly next time I need to pass through the state? I have a frontal dash cam which did not catch the tailgating behavior but can prove my speed."
302,"[MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","I have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. I'm a male in my 20s.

Last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. On the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. This air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. This campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

As soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. He showed no remorse whatsoever. He laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

I was so furious when it happened that I didn't know what to do. I sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. I wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while I emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. But instead I  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. It's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. It's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

He clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. While everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""I heard your ears were ringing. Sorry about that."" He didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. I grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but I absolutely do not forgive him.

This happened last Saturday, a week ago. For the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. Since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. It's the worst when I'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. I hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. Sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. I think I could have permanent hearing damage.

This  guy has been giving me shit since I was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. I've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but I figured some people here might have good info as well. I won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. Any info is appreciated. Suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but I really don't care about that if I end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. It's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. Thanks for any help.

303,"I missed my court date by accident, this sub prevented a major panic attack! (Arkansas)","Back in April, I got pulled over for expired tags and got a ticket for failure to register my car. I didn't know how to, but it gave me the kick in the pants to get me to the DMV. 

I swore my court date was on the 8th. I put it in my calendars. I took time from work. NOPE. It was the 6th. But I searched this sub, found out I needed to call. So I called first thing in the AM. They told me to come on Friday (today) and I could pay or I could reschedule my court date. I said I wanted to just pay and they told me my ticket would be $95. I asked if I had a warrant out because I missed, and they told me I wouldn't as long as I came and took care of it by 4:30 on Friday. 

I went in, had to wait about 20 minutes while they got all the people ready to go into traffic court. Then they helped me. I paid $95 and was only 10 minutes late for work.

304,Employer gave us all $0 paychecks because they haven't been doing our taxes right,"Colorado

When I got to work yesterday I was surprised by a $0 paycheck.  Apparently our taxes haven't been done right since 2015. They were just audited. Here's the note that was attached  https://imgur.com/a/yNjT4jm and my lovely paycheck  https://imgur.com/a/f1Ra4jc . This only affected the servers.  This is only my part time job, so I'm out about $100. Some of the servers though had worked over time and had $500+ checks that were zeroed.

305,A 15 year old girl made false allegations to CPS about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.,"My daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. I don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know I was talking about them. 

The girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... She just has delusions of grandeur). The mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

I will refer to the mother as Lorrie and the daughter as Katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

Lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying Katy. The assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss Katy. I'm not sure if Lorrie had anything to do with the CPS report but I can not contact her directly. Lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. I tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

Katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. My daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that Katy said and I advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. When the friendship fell apart, Katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. My daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

One of the things Katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and I remembered it pretty vividly. My daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

A few days ago, CPS knocked on our door while I was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what Katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. There is no one else who could have made this complaint. It was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. My husband said the CPS employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. I wasn't there so I don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

The problem is I have no proof. The assistant principal at my daughter and Katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around Katy when she made these comments about my son so I might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Do I even have a leg to stand on? All I have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

Any advice is welcome. I'm terrified.

I am in VA.

Edit: I'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. I just want to clear all of this up and I want Katy to be held accountable for making a false report. The things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. The allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. They were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do."
306,Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don’t think they actually took anyone’s dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I’m a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn’t know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I’m a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We’re not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I’m just dropping off a tray in someone’s room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. I guess I was acting paranoid because I was pissed about being suspected when I’ve tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


Hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. I hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she’s not here anymore, and I don’t know what is happening). Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**Edit:** I think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because I was acting like *I* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. That is some of that addict mentality, that I’m still working on with my sponsor."
307,Confidentiality Breach Made My Family Think I'm a Pedophile[GA],"I checked into a mental health clinic after being at a lowpoint in my life and having some suicidal ideation. I was underage at the time so it was a legal requirement I go. 

As I was being discharged, i was told I would not be going home with my grandfather or aunt and instead a DFCS (Georgia's Child protective services) would come to speak to me about group home placement. I was baffled because there's no reason that should happen. Eventually the worker decided I would go home with my grandfather, anyways. 

I learned this was because the therapist at the hospital told my family I was a Pedophile and often ""daydream of sexually assaulting children."" It was determined that I was a risk to young kids and they refused to discharge me into my family's care due to the young toddlers in the home. This is absolutely not true! During my stay, I told the therapist I often had flashbacks or nightmares about how I was raped as a toddler. I disclosed that I often thought about the violence that occurred to me during the day because I was mentally scarred. This does NOT make me a pedo.

Is it legal for her to say that? Since this, my family has isolated me, uninvited me from family gatherings and tried to put me in foster care. I am not a pedo, I struggle with PTSD from my own child sexual abuse. Once I turn 18, can I sue? What's the limitations on that? Please help."

Edit:  NC, USA

Edit 2:  thank you all so much for the responses.  I appreciate you taking the time to assist me.

I shared this post with a close friend, and they said that I should include the following info:

   I notified my employer on Friday that my condition has returned.  (My treatment team and insurance company are trying to figure out which risk is greater;  to treat in hospital, or to wait until the current crisis subsides. )  Laid off on Monday, and found out today that a part time has been promoted to full time and is doing my former responsibilities.   

I did not have health insurance  through my employer.  I was one of approximately 15 - 20 employees.

Again, thank you.

Edit 3:  not sure why locked."
309,"A drunk driver hit and killed my older brother 2 weeks ago. 7 minutes prior, she was stopped by police in a neighboring city for being asleep behind the wheel and they let her go. There were witnesses to the stop. Do we have legal recourse?","Just found out this shitty news during this nightmare of my life. Like the title says. There were witnesses to her being stopped in the neighboring city. I don’t know the details - whether her car was sitting there and she was approached by police, or if she was swerving and then stopped by police. 

Either way, they did not test her, they let her go, and 7 minutes later, she killed my brother and had no injuries. 

With COVID I am sure she is going to get a plea deal for convenience and it makes my blood run cold to think that she might only get something like probation for committing manslaughter! 

This woman altered the course of our lives in the worst way. Is a civil suit against the PD possible? Is there anything we can do? We can surely sue her but if she is from around the area where he was killed it’s safe to say she doesn’t have any real money. 

We are just really lost and wondering if I can get some legal advice on this."

tldr; can i get youtube videos taken down if the guy is using my picture? there is a strange ass random man using pictures of me and implying that i am his ""ex"". to me, this is slanderous and borderline stalking. youtube ignores me. if i make a response video to expose him do i need to protect myself first (get receipts/etc) or can i just talk? i don't know how to ""prove"" my side of the story. i just want it taken down"

312,I (23F) genuinely think that there’s someone living in my attic.,"I’m not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. I have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

To note. The house hadn’t been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I’ve been moved in for about a month and a half - I’ve heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then I’ve just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I’ll be honest and say I’ve been too scared to see if anything’s up there since I’ve moved in so I’ve never even seen the attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there’s a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn’t do anything and didn’t even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It’s a tent. There’s playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

Other than that - Do I hire someone to check the house? Do I call the cops again another day?  
Should I not stay here alone?

UPDATE: My other sisters boyfriend came over today and the two of them went up there and scooped it out. It looks like a weird grow op. Can’t can’t if anyone was there. To me it doesn’t look like it. But it’s strange regardless

Thank you to everyone whose been so kind. You’ve made me feel safe even if it’s been nothing. It’s hard to tell.  I can try to get back on my messages. But we’re changing the locks today and I’ll be looking into all the options for surveillance cameras."
313,Landlord's kids moved into my room during quarantine; I'm still paying rent and have to get her permission to *enter* the premises,"Hi Reddit! Long-time reader, first-time poster.

Hoping for advice on what actions I can take as a paying tenant, if any:

I'm a recent grad who rented a commuter bedroom last year to live closer to work. My lease has expired, so I've been going month-to-month. Back in late Feb/early March, my landlord (who is actually renting the place herself) asked me to **prepay 3 additional months of rent** because she needed the cash to afford her dentures. I had already prepaid a bunch of rent in January, so 3 additional months would cover me through June 2020.

Seeing that she needed help and sounded really exasperated, I took money out of my own savings account and **willingly prepaid my rent out to June 2020**. Unfortunately, a few days after that, shelter-in-place began, I went back to live with my mom, and I haven't lived in the commuter bedroom since.

This whole time, my rent was fully paid and I figured it'd be nice to still have access to the room should I need anything. However, when I asked for permission to come pick up  personal belongings a month ago (around 4/05), she asked me to ""please wait 2 weeks"" because I would be ""bringing foreign germs into the house"". Fair, since we *are* in a pandemic. So I waited.

**Turns out, her kids returned from college and fully moved in into my room during this time.** I stopped by on Friday to grab my things (medical prescriptions, retainer, etc.), and ended up moving out entirely and forfeiting my keys after seeing my belongings shoved into a corner of the bedroom I had been (and still am!) paying for. Given there was no physical space left for me to actually live there, I did not see any other choice.

After moving out, I sent her my notice to vacate (on 5/01), providing a full 30-days' notice and asked for my June rent back, in addition to my security deposit. I actually felt it was generous not to ask for March, April, and May back too - given that her kids had fully moved into the room without my knowing. She has completely ignored me.

I live in the Bay Area and work at a nonprofit, so rent is not cheap. It feels especially egregious that her kids have moved in while I continued to pay for the room *and* be told when I ""can"" or ""cannot"" enter the premises.

**Reddit, is there any recourse for this situation?**

I looked up California renter's rights, and understand that I have [rights to my security deposit back](https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-eviction-security-deposits.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en). How can I get this back now that she's gone dark on me? And what about rent that I prepaid as her kids quietly moved in and I was told not to enter the house? At the very least, I think getting June back is reasonable, as June would be *after* my 30 days' notice.

Thanks a ton in advance!

\--

**tl;dr -** Landlord's kids moved into my room during quarantine; I've prepaid rent through June 2020. We're month-to-month, so I could've cancelled anytime. How can I get my future month's prepaid rent back (would be after my 30 days' notice) and my security deposit? Can I ask for current prepaid rent too? (Given that her kids are already moved in?) Thank you!"
314,[CA] A friend snuck her cat into my home against my explicit wishes. My dog killed it.,"I posted an editorialized version of this in r/relationship_advice, but I’ll stick to the facts here. 

My dog is cat aggressive. Before I adopted him, he’d killed 3 cats that entered his fenced in backyard. Animal control declined to do anything about it since he was on his own property every time. Ever since I adopted him, I have been hyper vigilant in making sure he never encounters a cat, and there have been no issues. 

I live in a house I inherited, and allowed a friend “Rachel” to live with me for $300 a month. She did not have an official lease and lived with me for 5 months. About a month ago, another friend “Ashley” needed somewhere to live temporarily, and I agreed she could live with me for free for 2 months. 

I told Ashley her cat was absolutely not welcome in my home, and explained that my dog had killed 3 cats. She argued with me about confining the dog and cat on different levels of the house, or slowly introducing the cat, but I was firm that she either find other arrangements for the cat or she wasn’t welcome. All of this took place over text, so I have a paper trail.

I thought we were on the same page, but when she showed up to my house, I wasn’t home (but Rachel was) and they brought the cat in. My dog mauled it to death. 

When I got home, I was furious. I screamed at both of them to get the fuck out of my house and told Rachel her shit would be on my front lawn. I know I should not have said that, but I didn’t really put her things on the lawn, and we arranged a time for her to come collect things a week later. I’m not sure if this was technically an unlawful eviction. I did not change the locks, call the police, or otherwise try to force her off the premises. I screamed to get the fuck out and she just left. She willingly gave me her keys to the house and didn’t try to fight me on moving out. 

Ashley now wants me to pay $1500 for her to get a new cat, as she claims the one killed was a British Shorthair and was that expensive. She has contacted all my friends and family telling them about this, and has left me increasingly angry messages. 

I did have some damages to my home from the attack. 

How at risk am I for 
A) having to pay for this cat
B) owing Rachel damages for evicting her

What i’d really like here is to get a lawyer to draft up a letter to Ashley detailing that if she doesn’t stop harassing me, I will sue her for the damages to my house + the emotional distress of having to dispose of her cat’s corpse (which she left in my house). My main goal here is really just to be left alone though, and I definitely don’t actually want to sue her."
315,Guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. Said he’d sue me since I didn’t slow down (GA),"EDIT: Finally know everything that has occurred legally. My stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. After the officer told me I could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. Guy told him I sped up and that I was “mad he was passing me.” Said Officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. I didn’t even think he actually got it) and saw that I already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. So. The officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

My parents are furious and we’re just waiting for my day in court because there’s no evidence I sped up, there’s no dash cam footage that’s mysteriously came up, there’s nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



Hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (I have a speeding ticket but I did my time for it). I was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it’s been rainy for a few weeks and I’m also just still paranoid since my first ticket. Two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

Cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. I guess he didn’t look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. I swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. The first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

I moved on from it since I didn’t cause the accident and I went on to school. Yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying I was being faulted for an accident and that this guy’s insurance was coming after me. I was so confused because my car wasn’t damaged, I don’t need this on my driving record, and so on. My stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because I was supposed to slow down when I saw him passing. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do here. Is this a situation where I can tell him to pound sand or should I take it seriously? 

Edit: My stepdad called juvie court today and asked what I was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene I spoke to (I told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. He asked to see my license. I didn’t see why not. He basically said “Thanks for reporting I’ll contact you if I need anything else have a good day”) is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. And the reason he let me go then was because he “didn’t know I could’ve prevented the accident until further investigation.”

We’re even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we’d all just have to wait. I’m guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him I sped up or something. I don’t know what to do here because if this sticks, I lose my license until I turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket). "
316,"An Airbnb I recently stayed at had hidden cameras in the bedrooms, my friends and I were recorded having sex. Anything I can do to have the footage deleted?","Some friends and I met up in Southern California to have a little weekend together since we all live in different parts of the country. I brought my girlfriend with me and so did a few of my friends. The weekend went how it went and on our last day there we noticed there were small hidden cameras speckled through the home. After checking the bedrooms we confirmed there were in fact 2-3 cameras in each room all pointed towards the beds. I contacted the hosts and they stated that its their home and legally they can have security cameras in the home. Is there anything we can do to have the footage deleted or something? I understand the need for security cameras in case of damages or stolen items, but being pointed at the bed in all the rooms? It makes me feel really uneasy.

UPDATE: Made a call to the local police department, as Im already back home. Informed them of the situation and filed a report over the phone with explicit details. My friend who lives in the area is going to follow up in an hour or so after work ends for her."
317,Update sister took $250K from mother with dementia,"original post is nearly a year old.

Mother passed away, and within a week older sister & caretaker of mom for 2 years had gotten our mother with dementia to sign over $250K, bought a house, put it in her name, and had about $20K left over that she kept, and hid it from me for a year.  She realized I had a good idea of the value of our mother’s estate and admitted it to me.

I tried to work with her, and get her to pay out the other siblings what their fair share of the $250K would have been to them/us, she refused and cut off communication.

I filed a police report for financial elder abuse, the detective just emailed me, he subpoena’d medical & financial records, and is having sister come in for an interview in the next week.

I hope it gets resolved.  Please forgive me, since this is an active case, I don’t want to disclose the location."
318,"[Norway] My classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. The sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. Me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. How do I get her to give my/our money back?","Over three years ago (January 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. My classmate, let's call her Frida, received money from us and then placed the order. We were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

Long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. Frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. In August 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money ASAP. Everyone were relieved and happy. After a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. One person said she got her money (Frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. Now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

I sent her a PM the other day asking for an update. I said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. That the silence is the frustrating part. She has completely ignored it.

What can I do to get my/our money back? I thought about telling her I'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. The report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200B;

**Edit since I cant reply to people**: Thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. And you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if Frida had them a while). I do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

I'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. Norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. Since we left that school three years ago I don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. If it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

We are all spread across the country now, but I'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as I message Frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. Hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then I'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. I won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

I'm also gonna pop her then-boyfriend a message and ask him what he knows, as he's one of my best friends and might have some intel. "
319,NYC- I just found out when I applied for unemployment today that my previous claim was deemed an 'overpayment' and I now owe the DOL $5K. My former employer lied to get my benefits terminated. This is from 2016 am I totally fucked?,
320,(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

322,"Dog died while under sitter‘s care - story does not add up (Los Angeles, CA, USA)","My fiancé and I were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (Los Angeles, CA). We dropped the dogs off on Tuesday. The sitter informed us she was going out of town on Wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from Wednesday until her return on Saturday. She also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for “emergencies”. 

Today (Saturday) I get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn’t going to make it. I call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. He was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when I left him. 

I drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the “bite marks” he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which I immediately explain I know nothing about. They bring out my dog’s body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. I immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

Original sitter finally caves and explains that he was “attacked at the dog park” by a “pit-type dog” and she did not get the other dog owners info. Says that she didn’t tell me because she “didn’t want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal”. I ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a “No....Yes... Kind of” and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn’t want to “ruin my trip” and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

I wait for original sitter to get back to town. While outside I confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. While waiting for original sitter to show up fiancé overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying “[original sitter] told people we’ve been working together and I don’t normally do this kind of stuff but I could lose my job” - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

Original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. She cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (I have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

She tries to say it must have been a “brain disease” and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... But the vet I spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that A) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; B) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

It seems to my like the original sitter’s story is not adding up and I’m wondering if she didn’t have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. What can I legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do I have against her? I don’t even care about the money because it won’t bring my dog back, but I want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else."
323,"I work for a privately owned brewery/restaurant. Last week they held a huge event and told everyone they had to be available to work. They then told us we would be ""volunteering"" and the house would keep the proceeds and ""donate"" all the cash tips we made. This feels illegal.",
324,"Papers served to me weren't for me; person serving demanded to see my identification, in my own backyard.","I noticed a man I didn't know standing in my backyard, which is not that unusual as there's another house back there with a separate address and sometimes sales/delivery people get confused. I asked him if I could help him and he mumbled a name that sounded similar to mine. I said, ""Yes?"" at which point he handed me an envelop and said, ""you've been served."" I've never been arrested, to court, or sued, so I read the paper and saw the name was not mine, not even close really. 

I told the man that wasnt me and he said, ""then why did you answer yes when I said your name? You've been served, you'll have to take it up with the court."" And started to walk away. I told him he mumbled, I dont hear well, and he could walk away but he hadn't served the right person because that was not me. He proceeded to argue with me, insisting I had answered to the name he said and it was up to me to figure it out. I said again, ""okay, you can leave, but I'm telling you this is not me and whomever is supposed to get it has not been served."" He then started demanding to see some ID, and I refused.

At this point, being home alone, I set the paper on the deck railing, stepped back into my house, and locked the screen door between us. Here's this stranger standing in my back yard, telling me I lied to him and I'm legally obligated to prove I'm not who I already said I was. I told him to leave or I was going to call the police myself. 

Eventually he left and I didn't have to call the police. Was I obligated to show him ID? If he comes back, can I report him for tresspassing? This is in Southern California."
325,"My neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. He has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else I show the house to.","I'm moving soon and need to sell my house. When my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what I would expect to get.

After I turned it down he became agitated. Since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them ALL about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". He stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

I can only conclude that he's expecting to get a cut from getting his friend the house at an extremely low price. Are there any laws against this? Do I have any legal recourse if he follows through with his threats?

326,[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can’t thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: “Someone I’ve never met claims they own my house”.  This is the first update, and I’m hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they’d been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner’s title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a “Bargain and Sale” deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn’t called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said “Where is the deed?”  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we’re starting to think they don’t have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who’s like “Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can’t see it.”  It’s possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it’s not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn’t been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them “You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.”
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of “Take the Lis Pendens off.” And “Ok”.  I’ll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is “Where. Is. The. Deed?”  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we’ll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that’s like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I’m not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude."
327,"Banned from public unuversity due to false allegations without hearing my side. Banned lifted three weeks after person reda ted all charges and admitted to lying. USA, Washington","Edit: title should say ""redacted"". Sorry for the spelling errors. I didn't spell check before posting.

Edit2: It was a female. It is a title ix investigation
I did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said I didn't have much to fight for. The ""online"" courses were not online. It meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. It wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. And even so, only one class provided me resources. The dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

I was banned from campus following allegations against me. I was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. The allegations not only never happened but I have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

I was brought into the Dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. I told them I had no idea what they were coming from and I barely know this person. They still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class. Then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. And another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. Despite this I am still ""under investigation"".

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

Because of this I have no school and no job.

The university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

Do I have any rights whatsoever??? I'm out a job. Thousands of dollars and school."
328,"My truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. [WA state]","My truck (‘87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid October. I immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

Fast forward to last Friday, I receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... On November 1! Six weeks prior! From my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

I called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. A later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which I would think is illegal. Apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but I had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. I had no idea it had even been recovered!

All I really want is my truck back, which I don’t think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. Am I entitled to compensation? And from whom? The towing company sold it before it’s stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. Do I have legal recourse here?

I have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their “complaint hotline” until tomorrow. Same situation with the towing company.
Any advice greatly appreciated."
329,Brother's friend wanted a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes and a bed' while he moved back with his parents until the covid crisis is over. My house is now packed full with urine-stinky furniture. What can I legally do with it? Country NSW Australia.,"I get on OK with my brother, and his friend hadn't shown any hint of being an idiot over the last 15 years so I went along with this. I'll call my brother's friend Doug.

My brother phoned me a while back and asked if I could do a favour for Doug and he put doug on, and doug told me he's gotta move back in with his parents because he lacks work like all of us, and needs a place to store 'a couple of wardrobes full of clothes, and a bed' for about six months until things open up again. My brother told doug I had a spare room with not much in it (which is true), and I was happy to help so I said sure, bring it over. The spare room is more than big enough for a couple of wardrobes and a bed.

Through miscommunications and a shift change at work I couldn't be there when doug moved out of his old place and put his stuff in the spare room, so I dropped my spare key to my brother and he supervised doug. on Friday afternoon I came back home to a house packed full of what looks like every possession doug has ever owned packed into every room of my house, and almost all of it is urine stained and covered in mouse droppings.

""A couple of wardrobes full of clothes and a bed"" has turned into two wardrobes full of mouse droppings clothes and boxes, a dozen garbage bags of more clothes, six chairs and a kitchen table, a bedside table, a dozen boxes of books, two bookcases, boxes of kitchen implements, half a dozen wall hangings and paintings, a house door covered in stickers, a credenza, a single bed and a double bed (both of them REEK of urine and bloke), four small chests of drawers, three kitchen cupboards, a pair of card tables, and two refrigerators with food in the freezers and plugged into my power, and more bags of bedclothes, electronics, just about everything to fill a regular small house.

Everything in the house stinks and I can't do this. I don't mean it just has a scent to it, it stinks badly. I can taste the stink in my mouth even when I'm out of the house. With the heater on now it's winter it's nauseating.

I phoned doug and told him he has to come and get this all out, and he can't. He's already 600km away on his parents property and has no money left. I told him I'm going to dump the lot of it if he doesn't come get it, and he told me I'd made a binding verbal agreement with him and if I damaged anything of his he'd come down on me like a tonne of bricks with legal action. ten minutes after getting off the phone with him, his dad phoned and made more threats the same.

I can't reach any of the shelving in my spare room, I can't use half my couch or my art desk, I can only JUST reach my own clothing in my bedroom drawers and I can only use one chair in my kitchen.

I've contacted my brother and a stupid shrugging noise and said he thought that's what I agreed on.

What am I legally allowed to do with all this? I agreed to a couple of wardrobes and a bed. I did NOT agree to a house full of stuff. I want to at least get the worst of it out of the house immediately but it's been raining and we have a week more rain forecast. I can't afford to put it in storage, I'm slowly draining my savings the last few months as work has been cut back due to covid. I don't have a garage or shed, I have no undercover place to put any of this. Best I could do was borrow a tarp and wrap up the worst wardrobes and clingwrapped the beds but that's only a minor help as it all smells bad.

I did a house plan drawing, sorry it's rubbish. on the left is my normal house, TV is the lounge, S spare room D desk room B bedroom and K kitchen. on the right is the same with all of doug's stuff added in red. https://imgur.com/a/I0eXuDz

Edit: ok this has gone beyond legal advice and beyond a joke I think, I just went around taking photos and doug has a dried up used cat litter tray in the bottom of his wardrobe underneath clothing, the bags of clothing have mouse nests in them, and there are cockroaches. I've phoned friends, we're dumping it on the front lawn tonight (it's 1130pm here) and I'm texting doug's parents with the photos and if they want any of it they'll come get it. I'll deal with the consequences of that later, my sanity and sanitation is worth more."
330,My city is trying to give me points on my license for skateboarding! Representing myself in court? Help!,"Hi, I'm new to this sub so please excuse me if I'm sloppy here.

I was riding my [electric skateboard](https://i.imgur.com/F6ahlAk.jpg) down the main street of my town. When I stopped at a red light a ""micro-mobility enforcement officer"". Essentially a bike cob that can only write tickets. He pulls up behind me and summons for [190-69a](http://hobokennj.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1628&MediaPosition=&ID=2704&CssClass=) and claims I ran a red light about half a mile back on the main street. I don't remember if I did. When I did research I saw that the fine would only be $20+ court fee. I was going to plead guilty, pay, and get on with my life. When I arrived in court and spoke to the prosecutor she told me this would result in points on my license. It was then I brought up the fact that the wording of the ordinance specifically and exclusively refers to ""scooters"". She then left and came back 2 minutes later. I was told to request to have the officer present for questioning I think. The prosecutor said that I need to ask the officer what I was riding when he pulled me over and that if he says ""skateboard"" that I'm home free.

331,Won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while I was in high school. They said I had to wait until college to receive the money. The organization is shutting down. Can I do anything to still receive my money?,"**location:** I live in Rockville, Maryland, and the organization is based in Rowland Heights, California (I believe)

Basically, I won this high school gaming tournament where the winners were promised $2000 college scholarship money. The other winners (my teammates) started college in previous years and have already received their money.

I only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. They gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (WTF?). I suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. Their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

There was no written contract, but the money was promised. They also made a Facebook post after the tournament saying ""Congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

Thanks in advance! This is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: to make it clear, this is a small organization, not a big company

edit: I have been contacted by the organizers and they claim they are working on it right now... I think I will still pursue action, especially if they don't give me a definite response on when I can receive my money.

edit2: They told me """"within one month"""" to ""verify"" my identity as a student. I have already provided the information, I'm thinking that if they're not ready to send the check within a few days then I will get legal involved.

332,Just found out that a warehouse is being built on land that I own. I was never told about it and didn't sell my land to anyone.,"I own property in North Carolina. It's a piece land of on the outskirts of a town/small city that's slowly expanding. It used to be farmland, and there was an old house of little value. I live out of state and have not visited the place in 8 years. No one has been living in the house for the last 18 months. After all this time I just went to have a look at my property.  I was in for a quite a shock as I arrived where my house used to be: the house has been torn down, and there is a construction crew working all over my lot. They said they're building a warehouse and offices. There's a huge hole in the ground. As I was there there were 2 excavators digging further into my land. A small hill that there was was flattened.

I couldn't believe it because I've not been told about my land being used for construction, ever. I haven't sold my land or the house. I've never been called by anyone seeking to buy it.  As I was driving there I noticed that the city has expanded and there are now buildings much closer to my land than ever before, but I had no idea that my own land was being used for development. This is so crazy. I can't believe I'm even typing this. I've paid the property tax on this lot every year. It's my name on the title. I'm livid, my land was taken from me without anyone telling me about it.

I want to make the construction crew stop working on my property immediately. Then I want someone explain me how this could happen, and of course get appropriate compensation from whoever is responsible. Where do I start? How do I make them stop? I tried talking to the workers but they wouldn't listen.

Edit: I get it, I'm getting a lawyer.

Edit 2: and now the GIS website says it's no longer under my name. This is so f...ed up. I have no words. I've paid the taxes every year. How does this even happen? How do they send me taxes for property they don't think I own?

333,"Pharmacy gave my controlled substance prescription to someone else. Refuses to admit they were in the wrong, refuses to refill my prescription, refuses to tell my doctor they screwed up, and is telling me they cannot help me until they do a month long investigation.","I take a medication which is considered a controlled substance, if i don't have my medication i struggle to function properly. I go to a common pharmacy chain in Ontario, Canada. 

Last Monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

On Wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. After taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance Tuesday afternoon. I denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in Thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

Thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* Insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. Which i denied repeatedly.
* I told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* Now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. I told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. Who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* Unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. Which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* I called my Doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. The head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. He told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* The head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

I went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. They agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

On Friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance. 

Can anyone help me? Or tell me what the hell i should be doing here?"
334,UPDATE: My BIL stole my kittens and sold them. Police aren't helpful and new owner is not budging. Do I have any recourse?

I went back to the station and managed to talk to a police officer who was actually interested in doing his job. I showed him the texts, the conversations with the coworker, and copies of the vet bills. He went to have a chat with this coworker, and she voluntarily gave the kittens up. My cats are home safe! She did deny that she paid for them when talking to the officer, but I don't know what to believe. 

Someone did suggest on my post that I go through my belongings to see if my BIL had stolen anything else. It turns out some stuff was missing, though nothing too precious because we didn't notice it missing right away. Still, I believe we will be pursuing this with the police as well.  "
335,(Update) Cease and Desist letter after posting a review on YT and tricked by developer for address/name,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

So it's been an interesting two months, after my post I started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

I finally found an attorney that understood what I was talking about and wanted a link to the Reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice I received. 

He accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist I received and a few possible future letters/calls.

He responded asking them exactly what statements I made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. Since I previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

He also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between QA, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

It also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that I still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

Also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. He also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between QA, developers etc.

So after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. Nothing for about a month but then I received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom PS4 limited edition console, bobble heads, Funko pops, just every piece of swag I think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""Sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

My attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

He sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. They sent out a check for $500 and some papers I needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and I won't sue them.

Thank you LA, I didn't get sued and after it all I came out ahead. I'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!"
336,Rear ended by a cop who pressured me not to report it [MA],"This is happening right now. I work at a dog daycare and was driving a group of pups back from the dog park, going the speed limit, when a car bumped into me. Turns out it was an unmarked police vehicle. Since I’m at work, I asked if I could just photograph his insurance information and file a claim later. He said that since he’s police I would need to stay and wait to file an accident report. 

He kept emphasizing that this would be a long process, that the damage wasn’t that severe, and that I should let it go. He also tried to accuse me of speeding, which I wasn’t—this happened maybe 50 yards past a crosswalk at which I had stopped, so I don’t even think it’s possible for me to have been speeding unless I had floored it. It made me uncomfortable that he was so adamant about me not filing a report, like maybe this isn’t his first accident, so I went ahead with filing it.

What should I expect to happen next? Is it true that he wasn’t able to just give me his insurance so I could have moved on with my day? Can he make this out to be my fault somehow? Am I owed any compensation from him personally or from the police department for the rest of my shift I’m likely going to miss?"
337,[Update] They removed all the cats from my mom's house.,"Animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. Over the weekend I took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that I cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. She also thanked me for getting her a new bed. She couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house. 

 Animal control, with a lot of help confiscated all the cats except two, and all of the birds. For those debating it, no it was not a swan, but a young duck. I should probably have known, but I wasn't going to take a second peek into that room. The total cat count was 213, and the total bird count was 87. There were a significant amount more that were, unfortunately, dead. Many of the cats were sick, and may have to be euthanized.

My mother is extremely upset, she has been admitted to the hospital for reasons I would rather not get into. I don't know if the house is saveable, the situation is still being assessed. I'm sorry it's not a happy update, but at least I'm no longer drowning in cats."
338,Drive-in theater neighbor telling us we can't watch,"Location: Indiana

My grandparents own a house that borders a Drive-in movie theater. They have lived here for over 20 years and the theater has been here longer than that. They have a pool with a raised deck, and you get a perfectly clear view of one of the movie screens from it. So ever since the theater changed their sound to FM, it was always family tradition to have movie nights on Grandma and Grandpa's deck, along with a bbq and the pool.

Anyways, this past weekend a few of us family members were over and we had our chairs out on the deck and grandpa had burgers on the grill. We were about ready to watch the movie when the owner of the drive-in came to the edge of the property line and told us the movie was for paying customers only. This left us quite perplexed and in order to avoid any confrontation, my grandparents cancelled movie night.

My question is, does the Drive-in have any authority to tell us we can't watch? It's not like they're losing any money by us viewing it, they put the sound over the free FM radio, and we aren't tampering with any fences or trees that might be blocking the view.

Edit: Please stop sending me PMs asking which drive-in this is. I will not dox them or us."
339,(MA) My elderly father was laid off in a position elimination three weeks ago. 24 hours ago they posted that they are hiring for the same position.,"(Massachusetts)

Hi all,

Need a bit of guidance here. I am writing this on behalf of my dad.

Three weeks ago, he received a call from HR letting him know that he is being laid off due to his position being eliminated. I work in HR, and probed him for a bit more info - he forwarded me the emails from his HR rep, which indicated that about 80 employees were impacted. My dad just turned 65, and the other employees impacted that he is aware of are older.

I asked him to ask his HR rep for a list of impacted ages and positions. Based on the information provided from him, it seems his HR Dept would be required to send this over according to the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act. The HR rep explained that this wasn't a large-scale layoff, and that each layoff was an individual situation (unsure what this means) and that this was a position elimination. He asked her again through email and she again said no.

About an hour ago, we saw that his position (incredibly similar yet reworded) was posted. He signed his severance agreement two days ago, and it appears that it was posted immediately following. He has seven days to retract his agreement. If it's relevant, my dad was basically a superstar at his job and received glowing performance reviews.

Really looking for advice here. My dad is at a loss. Thank you.

Edit: We will be reaching out to lawyers tomorrow. Thank you to everyone that contributed and continues to contribute, we appreciate all the advice that is coming in. And thank you to the kind soul for the gold, which my dad is ecstatic about (he is not familiar with Reddit) - I let him know that someone liked his post so much that he received a gold medal and he keeps asking me about it. So thank you for making his day, especially during a stressful situation.

Edit 2: thank you everyone for the well wishes and the advice. The majority of support here has been overwhelming.  We have been in touch with a local lawyer and I will update in the future once we come to a resolution."
340,"My sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. Now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to Canada. Is this legal..?","I am in **Ontario, Canada** while my sister was in Vancouver BC.

My brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. He is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

Nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). In agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

My sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. She asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. I agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

One month turned into two, and then finally 4. She kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in Europe to visit her fiancee's family. When she got back she would let me know. Then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. Never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

Finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* She isn't coming back to Canada, as she has decided to get married in Europe and live there with her fiancee.
* She isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* She said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

She has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

I know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. I can't take care of my brother anymore. On top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

I have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. I was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

So like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? Isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? I know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

To clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. We have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. To the point where i worry for our future. I can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question. "

About an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. All $1 of it. He told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

Our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. The police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. The condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as I plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

To me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but I am nowhere near a lawyer. To that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but I am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

I have no idea what to do here. Luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. Unluckily, my wife and I turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

I'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. Beyond that, do I have grounds to evict him? If so, how do I recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? Does the tenant have any sort of liability here? If I do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can I sue the seller for that as well? What about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? Is there anything else that I am not thinking of?

I am shaking with anger right now so I apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Edit: Location is New York, specifically Putnam County.

**Update (4:45PM):** I just got a call from my attorney's admin. He's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. Apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. Needless to say I am looking forward to hearing from him.

**Update 2 (5:25PM):** Just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. The evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. We're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). I'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for the advice and reassurance. Wish me luck!"
342,TX - Update. I informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.,"Met up with him after work and got right down to it. I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

343,UPDATE: Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"Delaware, USA

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

I found the fence on Thursday. Saturday I was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. So on Friday morning, I had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. I called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

I took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

I also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. If I find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, I'll be informing the police.

So, on Friday afternoon, I removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which I put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

We still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now I don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. I will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

Thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if I learn who built the fence I will be sure to update again!"
344,My Brother used my name in a traffic stop,"Location: Vermont

My wife and I received our auto insurance renewal and noticed a huge increase in our premiums. I saw the word ""citation"" next to my name in the insurance paperwork. I haven't had a speeding ticket in over 10 years.

After calling insurance, DMV, and the Judicial Bureau I was able to get a copy of the ticket that was issued back in July. The ticket was for a 52mph in a 35mph zone in the next town over from where I live. The ticket was contested and the defendant never showed up to court. It turned a 100 dollar ticket into a 250 ticket.

Turns out my Brother, who hasn't had a license in over 10 years, was driving my parents car and gave my name to the officer when he got stopped. This isn't the first time this has happened and I honestly don't know how he can get away with it.

I'm currently at risk for losing my license for the unpaid ticket and am now paying hundreds more for insurance.

What is my next step? The issuing officer no longer works for that police department and I want to press charges and get reimbursement if possible.

Thanks"

After completing depositions and discovery, we were able to settle. It was an extremely difficult process. A little advice: treat your work email like it is public record, because it is.  Even though it was hard, I am really happy I went through with it. I am happy with the settlement and happy I got to make their lives difficult for a year.  I am using part of my settlement to buy my daughter a small memorial in a public park. Also, one of my old boss's wife divorced him during all of this, and I heard from my old coworker that it was mostly because she could not believe he could be so heartless. "

Today they were forcefully removed from the property by the police. Our lawyer was somehow able to get a judge to look at everything and approve having them removed. The police officer basically told us to not move in and have the entire house professionally cleaned, as there is a bunch of needles and other things laying around.

On top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. All the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. In some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. Basically our house I guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

Our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. I wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

348,I purchased a vehicle and was assaulted by the salesmen when I went to pick it up several days later. What type of lawyer should I contact? Additional details in post,"A bit of a doozy...

I purchased a car Saturday in Massachusetts. I paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. Upon pickup on Tuesday,  I was told I was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that I was not entitled to. The dealership told me I need to pay $500 or else I can't have the vehicle. At this point, I already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything I needed aside from registration. As far as I was concerned it was my property at the time. After a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would F me up etc etc. After threatening me, I told him he couldn't do that. He then rushed me and violently pushed me . At that point, for my own safety, I tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. During the separation he hit me several more times because I was the only individual restrained by the other employees. The other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. The police were called and I filed a report. I have yet to request the police press charges. I declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. I had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated VIN.  Police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. If I requested the charges be pressed I couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  I sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed.

352,[FL]Car dealer threating to sue me because I paid off the loan immediately after buying the car.,"Long story short, I have excellent credit (800+). Recently bought a 1 year old car. Dealer did not allow outside financing, must finance through the dealer. I played dumb, got them to eat all dealer fee's, and before I signed on the dotted line I asked if they could take a bit more money off the car for a higher interest rate and a longer loan term. They said yes no problem. They gave me a rate of 7.99% for a term of 84 months. I bought the car, and drove off. The next day I went to a credit union, got 2.75% for 48 months, put some cash down with the credit union on the loan, and refinanced the car. That entire process took roughly 10 days as the bank that originally financed the loan didn't have the payoff amount available immediately. 2 months later the car dealer caught wind of what I did, and called threating to sue me for 3K in lost ""revenue"". There was no language in original loan contract regarding any kind of pre payment penalty to anybody. I could have paid of the entire loan to the original bank on day 1 with cash according to the contract, which, is what I basically did, except I just refinanced instead. The dealer is claiming I defrauded them by asking for a higher interest rate up front for more money off the car. I haven't been served yet, but I have been getting a LOT of nasty emails and messages on my voicemail. I'm fairly certain I can tell them to eat shit, but I wanted another opinion. Thanks!"

As I was leaving yesterday out the back door 2 cops pulled up and arrested me for breaking and entering.

I didn't put up a fight because I'm not stupid. 

They let me try to call my boss but he was out of town ice fishing for the weekend and didn't have a cell signal so he didn't get my message until this morning.

355,"Apartment complex installed ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. What are my options? [Colorado]","I got a notice via email a while back that the Apartment complex where I live in Denver was going to be installing ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment. I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

356,Update-I need more help. My ex deleted my BA thesis and it’s due in 7 days,"I need additional help. Based on the advice from my last thread I took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. They said I’d have it back by the end of the week. That would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

I got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. Tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

I’m not looking for technical advice. I need legal advice that I can use for my college and ex. My advisor said he can’t give me an extension, which means I won’t graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. Is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? My paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. Plus my backups were deleted. This whole situation is beyond my control. 

Is there any action I can take against my ex?

For the bot: I’m in Illinois. 

Edit:

[This is my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b856m5/my_ex_deleted_my_ba_thesis_and_underlying/). Basically, my roommates and I had a party on Sunday. My ex showed up which is not unusual because we were on good terms and her friends are friends with my roommates. My computer was available for people to play their own playlists. Again, nothing unusual. I woke up on Monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where I made weekly backups of my thesis). When I checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. I freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

Texted my ex later on Monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn’t hear back. Her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. She did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

I have a fellowship lined up after graduation that I’m not eligible for if I don’t actually graduate. I need an extension until I get my files back. I’m completely completely screwed if I can’t turn in my thesis. "
357,[Update] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.

Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)

The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state."
358,California. Can my ex force his religion onto our minor child?,"Me and my ex are both Muslim, and neither of us are practicing. We're divorced, mostly because of his strict cultural believes ( I'm American, he isn't). He was forcing me to wear headscarves and not work. When I took it off and got a job, he divorced me. 

My daughter is 3 years old and he's already telling her she can't do this or that ""because she's a girl and girls don't do that"". I always tell her the opposite because I think gender roles are unhealthy. 

She was in a toddler soccer team and he stopped taking her because he says it's for boys. I also wanted to put her in the toddler dance classes and he said only whores dance and he forbid it.

He is already forcing her to cover up and I always take it off of her, which starts a huge fight. He says his daughter will wear hijab and not be ""a whore"" and I tell him she doesn't have to wear anything she doesn't want to. 

She's obviously confused who to listen to.

My question is if he's legally allowed to force his religious practices on her against my wishes?

359,[UPDATE] Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18?

I'm safe, and I'm out.

I organised a place to stay with a coworker. I have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. My dad has some regular sport meetings on Saturdays that go for hours so I prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. I've been approved for a rental and I move there soon.

I contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when I told them he'd been telling me I couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

I took copies of all of his paperwork too because while I was getting ready to move I found most of what I knew about my parents separating was a lie. There was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. My dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when I was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. He's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when I'm 21. Some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. I think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. I did not find the letter I read when I was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

After I moved out my dad did try to contact the police. They came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say I couldn't look after myself. His words were that I was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

I've been back to Canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. We're still working out the details with a Canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but I have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people I remember. They were really worried about me when I went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

Thanks for all your help, your comments gave me the confidence to act."

My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

EDIT: The bot asked me to include a location so uhhh i guess Jersey? Kinda don't wanna get more specific than that."
363,Parents took $6000 from me without my consent. Resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.,"I live in Alberta, Canada. About a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. I was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

My father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. At the time, I didnt mind since I was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason I gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. Hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

All was fine until a couple months later when I decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

The tap function was on the card.

I confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. However, this only happened for three months. Around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. Due to a plane ticket I bought to see my gf this August as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, I was left with about $1000. However, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

I burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. While I was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

I had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. I was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. A couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

I lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. What should I do? 

UPDATE: After seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, I decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while I get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. Thank you all, I never thought this would blow up like this when I went to sleep last night. Knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than I did before.

You see, I have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement I was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as I found out just now during the moving preparations. It's still $500 cheaper than the room I paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. If you guys have any more advice, I'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation. "
364,Update!!! -My landlord called the cops on me for trying to pay my rent- cop made her let me pay- now I'm being evicted for non payment-Texas,"Thank you all so much for all the wonderful advice!!! I definitely feel more educated and informed about my rights now. 

I'm no longer being evicted and I got all of my late fees back as an account credit, except for $5, but at this point I don't even care to ask why.

 I used the property records to hunt down their main office in Houston(I live in Dallas) and forwarded them the same email outlining all the ways they had violated my lease that I had sent to the TAA, the City, as well as the apparently pointless (thanks, guys) BBB.

The guy there got me set up with the online payment system that they actually DO have, contrary to what the office manager here told me. Next month I can just pay online!

He went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. I actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court. 

I also now have the contact information for a pro bono place that specializes in housing, just in case I ever need it. 

Thank you all so much for the overwhelming amount of responses and information <3"
365,Company refusing to allow me to take personally owned tools home.,"I am from Illinois USA.

366,Wife’s girlfriend retracted my son’s foreskin and it got infected; my wife didn’t take him to the doctor and I found out only after witnessing his infection myself,"So my wife and I separated five months ago and she moved in with her girlfriend she was cheating on me with that led her to discover she wasn’t straight but lesbian. I should start off by saying this woman always gave me bad vibes, mainly because she is ditsy and irresponsible and avoids taking responsibility.

Anyhow. My wife has had our son the last few months during quarantine. Now that summer is coming and some states are starting to return to somewhat normal, I asked her to return him to me for some visitation. We are NOT divorced and as such we have no official custody agreement.

Honestly my hope was that my wife would realize she missed me and our marriage and would come home but now I am preparing to finally let go.

Anyways I went to pick up my son and took him home. I had to change his diaper and right away I noticed that his penis was very infected and swollen and abnormal looking.

I immediately phoned my wife and asked her what happened to our son.

She confessed that a few days earlier, her girlfriend volunteered to give him a bathe because my wife was really tired after a long day’s work (she is a substitute teacher and works night shifts in a warehouse).

Wife’s girlfriend has never cared for a child before let alone a boy let alone an uncircumcised boy, so she had no idea what the protocol was.

Apparently she googled how to clean under foreskin and stupidly read to pull it back and wash it with soap and water. Well that’s what an adult might do, but baby boys have their foreskin attaches to the glans. During or after puberty, the boy should be the first one to pull it back as part of exploration.

Anyway, she did pull it back and scrubbed it really hard because she thought it was so dirty it stuck together. Again this woman is an IDIOT.

My wife since then has just been putting Vaseline and neosporin instead of taking him to a doctor!!

I immediately took him to an urgent care center and they told me that he has an infectious growth there that needs to be treated with antibiotics.

I am so angry that my wife let this happen. She basically agreed to let her circle fiend who has zero child care experience bathe my son which led to his current serious injury.

What I’m wondering is would I be justified in keeping my son indefinitely while I begin working with my lawyer to draft a divorce agreement?

I also don’t want this woman (the girlfriend) ANYWHERE near my son whatsoever even if she gets partial custody. And would be I be a jerk if I used this incident as evidence of negligence? I recorded the whole conversation where she admitted to me what happened (and yes it’s legal to do so where I live).

Please help me think this through because I am incredibly frustrated!!! And angry! My poor son :(

367,I’m being sued by the at fault driver who doesn’t know I have dash cam footage,"Hello, 

I got hit in Brampton, Ontario in October 2018. 

I’ll try to keep it short! Last October a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as I started going through the green. 

I called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. No one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. They didn’t ask questions or care. No ambulance came, no major injuries. 

The insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as I was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). No issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that’s it I moved on. 

Fast forward about 5 months and I received mail that I believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what I believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

Her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. It doesn’t make any sense as she wrote “he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light” 

The funny thing is, I don’t think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. This footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as I’m moving forward at the green. All very clear on the footage. 

My question is, how can she sue if she’s at fault? I’m sure I’ll win a case with the footage I have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? That’s what I’m most worried about. 

Any thoughts on this situation is helpful. 

Thanks"
368,Update: Janitor being sued by a customer: you people called it it was a scam!,"Thanks for your help with [my question](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g0j6v9/being_sued_personally_by_a_customer_of_the_store/). You guys are good it was indeed a scam as some of you said! So I took the letter to my manager and we went to the general manager's office. Seems like everyone (my manager, coworker who was on the same shift) received the same letter. They said not to worry and go back to work they will handle it, at most I'll be asked to give a statement but I won't be liable for anything.

Then they pulled the security tapes, by luck they keep them for long, and they were quite interesting. They even called me so we could have a good laugh. So this lady and her husband had been at our store and bought two full carts of groceries. They both were pushing a cart and for some reason the guy wasn't able to control his and it started taking speed (parking lot has a slight slope) and hit the woman. She fell hard on her ass, must have hurt. She had a hard time getting back on her feet so maybe she was injured for real and that's where the medical bills come from? Anyway. She went back to their car and half an hour later back into the store. Then she literally flew herself to the ground when she passed the section I was cleaning. That was quite an artistic ""fall"". Then of course she starting yelling and everything. So yeah, a scam alright, but maybe the injuries were real. It sucks that she got injured but it's really scummy to try and scam minimum wage workers who don't have money to throw around. I don't get why people do that. I must say I was quite scared before you people gave me advice, thanks a lot for your help."
369,URGENT! My boss threatened to fire all staff for unionizing for wanting safer conditions and I think he's going to follow through later today. Can someone explain difference between non-recall and termination as it applies here? NY,"Hello. I've been organizing my coworkers in union activity in an effort to get safer working conditions (and maybe higher pay) when we, a retail business, reopen after COVID-19. We don't feel like our safety concerns were taken seriously or that they were willing to budge on some important parts of our requests. This business is a small chain with a corporate structure above us. Our demands were sent to the higher ups after our boss freaked, and I don't think enough was done and neither do any of my coworkers who have participated. We were told that they ""are aware of \[our demands\] and will address them when the time is right."" After our demands they very suddenly decided that they are going to reopen this Saturday, the 30th. Without discussing doing more about worker safety concerns than the half assed nasty email that was sent. About half of the staff at this store has an underlying health condition, and imo, they have offered the bare minimum if that.

 I have educated myself and my coworkers about the National Labor Relations Act and that we should be protected should we unionize. That seems like the direction it's going. Shit is going to hit the fan TODAY. He privately emailed a coworker that if I (serious health condition) or another coworker (also with a serious health condition, but has another job and may just leave this one) didn't agree to work a specific shift he will have considered us all to quit and will replace all staff. We have been clear that we ARE willing to work, just with better conditions. We have been clear that we do not want to quit. I reference the NLRA a fair bit in the email and make reference to the ADA (he's not willing to make reasonable accommodations for those of us at higher risk). But the part about ""considering us to have quit"" is throwing me. Can someone explain non-recall and termination as it relates here? I have been referred to a local law service, but I do not know how long that will take. A similar organization (unrelated COVID crisis, yay me) referred me to a lawyer within the same organization who doesn't practice employment law so she was unable to answer some of my questions and I do not know how long it will take me to get put in touch with an employment lawyer, but I have to send this email TODAY. 

All help is appreciated, TIA!

370,"Someone has spent the last few days submitting copyright claims on almost all of my cosplay/art. I am lost, and don't understand what is going on.","Hi,

In the last few days i have received thousands of messages from various different sites i post pictures/videos to claiming it was removed due to a copyright claim. Pretty much every single photo, original art, or video i have ever done has ether been hidden, or outright removed.

Everything from cosplay photos, to art i drew, to a random video of me drunk with friends from 3 years ago that i posted to my instagram. I don't understand.

Most of the stuff removed says it was removed via a DMCA claim, while Instagram/FB says it was removed due to Copyright Infringement.

Some of the notices reference a person who is doing the claim, i have no idea who this person is. Other ones reference a company in China, and yet again i have no idea who they are.

Some sites want me to submit a counter-DMCA claim, but give me very little explanation as to what that is. While some other sites provide a way for me to file this counter claim however i am required to provide all of my personal information including my address which makes me extremely uncomfortable.

A few of these sites seem to have terminated my account due to the number of infractions.

I am really confused right now, can someone give me some advice as to how to handle this? I don't really understand what is going on, and considering the sheer amount of these things can i just cut my losses and ignore some sites?"
371,I'm a pedestrian who waved in an SUV in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.,"This happened a few days ago. I live in Philly and I was walking along a busy street and I see this SUV at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. There is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. The SUV wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. I saw that he did and I just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. He ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb I guess and turned at the last second). 

They got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim I think. I didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since I saw the whole thing. They both shared each others insurance and ID.

The SUV guy asked me for my ID for witness too for his insurance claim. Soon after he took a picture of my ID on his phone he said I was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. He is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. I felt bad because I gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he DID turn at the last second. The other guy was also annoyed that I shouldn't have told him to go. 

He called and left a VM that I need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. He said that if I agree to pay I can just pay half of the damages.

I'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and I don't want to go to court. If it goes to court will I have my credit ruined? Sorry I don't know too much legal stuff!

Edit: Now he is saying that my future will be screwed and my credit score is going to be messed up and that there is a possibility that I may be criminally convicted?? I am an immigrant here on a visa and I am worried that it's going to affect me!

Edit 2: Hey guys, thank you so much for your support! This has been really helpful. However, I am getting conflicting advice here. Some are saying that the other person (SUV guy) has a case and it seems like there have been cases similar to this. Some are telling me that I am absolutely guilty and should have everything taken from me! Also I am not sure who Ayan Rand (legal author?) is and how this affects me? I spoke with a legal hotline service and they said that they are not sure of the laws but I need to get a notarized letter from the SUV guy saying that i won't be sued if I choose to pay. I am honestly super scared and stressed that my immigration status will be affected (like the guy said). Should I be contacting immigration lawyer too?"
372,"[Manitoba, CANADA] (UPDATE) My cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.","Previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting nasty messages, I figured I should edit this to let everyone know that I have finally convinced my cousin to report him. He will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is Saturday. We are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. Also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of June 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

There you go folks. Please stop insulting my cousin and I."
373,Divorce agreement states that I get to claim our children on my taxes but she has contacted me saying I can’t and wants me to refile for the last five years so she can claim them.,"We live in Western New York and while the backstory to why is a bit long and drawn out, though not pertinent to the situation at hand, according to our divorce agreement that was signed in 2014 I get to claim our children (there are four children) on my taxes each year even though I’m the non-custodial parent. Her financial situation as far as I know is that she doesn’t work and only gets my child support and disability checks as she has epilepsy.

This week with the Covid-19 stimulus going on she apparently started looking into tax return law and found out about form 8332 and is now wanting me to re-file my last 5 years tax returns so she can file and claim our children. I was vaguely aware of the form, but mostly in that when filing (on TurboTax) it would mention either needing that or an agreement, written or oral, thus I figured I was okay with just the divorce agreement.

She says that that isn’t so and that she intends to force me to refile, etc. so, I guess the question is am I basically screwed? Or is it possible I’m in the right on this? Thanks."
374,"Cop took my plates, wont give them back. Bought new car, legally transfered my old plates to my new car. Got pulled over in MI, cop wont accept paper work from me or directly from DMV.

You send in the approved application/e-reciept with the title, both signed and dated. 

You keep a copy of everything as well. On the bottom of the e_reciept it stats 'operation of this vehicle is legal when you place the documents listed in the mail for delivery to:....'. 

I got pulled over in MI for an unrelated reason(not important but i can go into detail if you want) he couldnt find anything in their data base connecting my current car with the plate. Thats to be expected because of how soon it was. He also did not like the paper i have from the DMV with the above quote. He then had it impounded and removed the plates. That was last night.

I ask him exactly what he needs from the DMV to prove that the plates belong with my car. He says he needs some paperwork directly from them. I have the DMV fax and email him all paperwork involved they have, and he still wont accept it until its fixed in their system where he can electronicly check it. Which is different proof then what he asked for earlier. They even call him to explain that its legal for me to drive. Unfortunatly they cant put it in electonicly until at least monday when they get the stuff i mailed in. In the meantime my car is racking up impound fees and i have a court date for driving with improper plates. What do i do?"

After several months of back and forth with only small increases in the offer from Geico, I finally accepted their settlement, and promptly turned around and sued the other driver in Small Claims Court for the difference. Geico told the other driver that their duties of subrogation had been met and he was on his own for this, so he showed up with his own lawyer for the initial hearing. The day after the hearing, that lawyer then contacted Geico, seemingly disputed their stance on subrogation, and then Geico contacted me with a settlement offer of the amount for which I was suing.

So in the end, Geico paid me the total replacement value of the vehicle as I saw it."

I also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. When she landed in Philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. When she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). She explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. They told her she could check it or she could stay in Philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. She surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. When she landed in Tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. He took her to baggage claim and I guess her medical bag was lost. She is now in Florida with no insulin, no medication. Her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over. 

I am beyond upset. I have called AA and they confirmed that insulin is allowed on board. What legal ramifications are there for this?

377,MN: Someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.,"This past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. They had been there for a bit when I let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously I wouldn't have done so). My dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). I coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

Last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. I can only imagine where he will be going with this.

I know I need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now I'm not even sure where to start. Am I liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? Since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

378,"I (27 M) have been raising my son (8) since he was born. His mother who left before he was even 1 is now threatening me with attorneys and court, should I be extremely worried?","This is a throwaway account and actually my first post on Reddit ever. 

So my story is a long and complicated one, but hey who's isn't. Here goes. 

I had my son at 19 years old and what a journey it has been. I have felt the highest joys and the deepest frustrations while growing side by side with my son. But I'd do it all again for him. 

His mother and I separated before he turned 1. She moved to NYC to ""find"" a better future for him. She said that the first few years of his life, ""don't really matter because he won't remember them."" And while that may be true in a way, she'll never remember his first steps, his first words, his first fears and how he conquered them, his first falls, his worries about the doctor's office and those ever painful shots, and all the small things in day to day life. 

My parents and extended family have helped me tremendously in so many ways. I have even tried my best to build and maintain a relationship with her side of the family while she threw them all to the wayside in her pursuit of her new life in the city. We have spent more holidays with them than she has. Her father has even multiple times told me he would be on our side if it ever came to a court.

 She has erased all traces of being a mom even on ALL social media platforms, so no one in her life in the city know that she is a mother.

During the first 4 years of his life she would only see him for the ""big"" dates (holidays/birthday). 
The longest stretch of time she has spent with him in his 8 years of life is 6 days. I take him to school, pay for school, take him to the doctors, feed him, and take care of his every need financially, physically, emotionally and everything in between. 

Fast forward to when he is around 5 and a half. I fall in love for the first time in my entire life. My girlfriend (24F) and I become everything parents should be for a child. We build a home together and the love between the 3 of us has literally brought us to tears. This of course infuriates her since day 1. 

(The mother of my child on the other hand went right into a relationship less than a month after us separating, and many more relationships after that.) 

She never sends him anything. No clothes, no care packages, no visits. She bought him a ""deluxe"" iPad and Louis Vuitton pants when he was like 3. That iPad has been their only form of communication because she refuses to talk to me. She calls him maybe twice a month tops. Sends him cat videos occasionally. Never answers when my son tries to call her. 

Today is my son's 8th birthday and my son, my girlfriend, my son's godfather and I, all had the most fantastic day at a water park and riding boardwalk rides and eating yummy snacks the whole day through. But of course all good things must come to an end. We come home to see that I have literally 30 missed calls from 1:15 pm -1:30 pm. (She hasn't called me since last October when she decided she was leaving the entire financial responsibility of my sons school tuition on me after agreeing, like we always had, that we would split it.) ((She said I'm the main caretaker and I should be responsible for that, and that she doesn't need to pay if she doesn't want to.)) When I got home and called her back is when the most recent argument broke out....

I have never slandered her name publicly or privately and have always tried to help encourage them to have a relationship. I used to even drive my son TO and FROM my home state to NYC so that they could see each other.  Every child should have a mother in his life I truly believe that... But just because you gave birth doesn't mean you're a mother. My mom and my girlfriend have both been shining lights in his life... He has everything he needs. I try to do the best I can every single day that I walk this Earth with him. 

I had to pick up a 2nd job to make ends meet regarding his school tuition and all the other costs of living. Obviously next year he's not going back to that school. But working more means seeing him less and it breaks my heart but i know we'll figure things out like we always have....

Now what I'm asking is should I be very worried if she keeps threatening me with attorneys and court? She has done it many times in the past and she knows that it hurts me. Losing my son would be earth shattering for me... What should I do? Should I be the one to take her to court first? She warns me that she is well connected with lawyers in NYC, does that change anything even though my son and I have been living in NJ our whole lives? I'm just feeling lousy and lost. 

I don't know how to end this, I don't know how to even write this. Please don't mind my grammar or how I structured this. And to the patient brave Souls who read this entire memoir, even if it's just 1 person, I appreciate you SO much and any insight you can share would mean the world to my little family. 

Thank you."
379,Cousins ex bf is suing me because I reacted violently to a horrible prank he pulled,"
I am from Oregon. One of my cousins (now ex) bf of a year, who is trying to become a famous YouTube prankster pulled a prank on me where he pretended to abuse my little cousin. 

When I came home I heard yelling and the sounds of hitting and crying coming from my cousins room. When I ran up the stairs her bf came out and I asked what the hell was going on. In his words, “that b*tch cheated on me, so she got what she deserved” as I could still hear crying from that room and he was blocking the door from letting me in. I immediately blacked out(my dad used to physically abuse my mom in front of me, he knows this) and punched and kicked and next thing I knew he was on the floor screaming it was just a prank. I went into the room and he had a recording of a girl screaming but no one there. My cousin wasn’t even in on the prank, she didn’t know it was happening. 

I checked if he was ok and his nose was bleeding, and his braces had cut really badly into his lips. I drove him to the ER because he was claiming he couldn’t breathe out of his nose. He ended up with a fractured nose, and got stitches in his lip. The ER bill came out to almost $2k and he’s telling me I need to pay it. I refused. 

My cousin has since broken up with him.

He’s now suing me for assaulting and for the hospital bill. 

I still have the phone he was using to record the video but no way to access it because neither I or my cousin knows the passcode. 

What can I do? Is there a way for the court to demand he unlock his phone? Is it just his word against mine? I have no other proof besides his channel where he’s pulled pranks but not to the extent of this."
380,Cell phone repair guy stole my nudes!,"   Just like the title said, dropped my phone off, an imessage was sent to an unfamiliar number while it was there - I could see it on iMessage through my Mac. It contained 5 of my more private photos. 

   Upon pickup the employees were dismissive saying no one would do such a thing, and they can’t touch texts because they’d be in “big trouble”. The offending employee was quick to blame it on a glitch that comes with the new update, an update I haven’t even applied. Not to mention the photos were stored in a separate app. 

  I called the number a while later to find that it belonged to the employee. He apologized and promised to delete the photos, but I am pretty upset that my privacy was violated. I called the store to complain but only the offending employee was there and wouldn’t let me speak to his boss. I’ve left a complaint email but is this grounds for legal action? I can’t help but think I may not be the only person he’s done this to."
381,[MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. I am 16 years old. I got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows I cheated. I didn't cheat. My math has always been good except last year when I was dealing with depression. She says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so I must have cheated.

I told her that I didn't cheat and I'm offended at the accusation. Two days ago I was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that I should confess to cheating and tell them how I did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. He more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

I told him that I'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that I didn't cheat but he said that I could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. I told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? He still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that I could get that score.

Yesterday I was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if I let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if I give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. I have no knowledge of what he is talking about and I declined access to my social media and email.

I'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. This to me sounds very unfair and I can't help but feel like I'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? Because this does not make any sense. They have no evidence that I cheated and refused my offer of retaking the exam and they insulted my intelligence."
382,"[UPDATE] My roommate keyed the word ""pedo"" into my car.","Link to my previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lk1pyg/my_roommate_keyed_the_word_pedo_into_my_car/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

This is in Chesapeake, Virginia.

It has been 3 days since I found the word ""pedo"" engraved onto the passenger side door of my vehicle. I have a couple of updates on the situation.

When I got home, I confronted my roommate, and he slipped up saying ""he didn't care"" when I told him that he got caught on my cars camera keying up my vehicle. I of course lied, but he didn't know that.

I dropped off my car at the collision center, and I heard back from them today on the total amount of damages estimated to have been done to my car. The amount is over $1300, and that includes the deductible. According to Virginia's vandalism statutes, that is now enough to be felony vandalism. I have updated the Chesapeake Police Department on the cost, and I am hoping that it gets assigned an investigator.

Tomorrow, I am heading down to Chesapeake General District Court in order to file a small claims suit against my roommate before he moves out in an attempted effort to recoup some of the money that I have lost so far. That includes damages, renting a vehicle, and court filing fees.

Wish me luck."

384,[UPDATE] Recently settled a custody dispute and finally have my first overnight. Ex and her husband insist on entering my residence and I insist that they not. What can I do?,"Link to Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa\_recently\_settled\_a\_custody\_dispute\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rx3mx7/usa_recently_settled_a_custody_dispute_and/)

This is a bit of a lengthy update; it's still very fresh in my mind so I will try to keep useless details to a minimum. TL;DR of the original post is, my ex wife has a documented history of misrepresenting facts and presenting false allegations with regard to my personal well-being and living conditions. After going through court we settled for basically everything that I wanted, and today was supposed to be the first custody exchange. The TL;DR for this update can be found down below.

I called my city's non-emergency line on Thursday to inquire about civil standbys. The operator gave me some great information, and I got really confident that all would go according to plan.

I also contacted a friend who my ex knows and has a neutral-positive rapport with, and he came by for moral support and to be a third-party witness to the whole ordeal. Side note, my God, I am so happy that I have this guy in my life because he was the absolute perfect person to have with me for the whole ordeal. If you're seeing this man -- thank you again.

This morning ahead of the exchange I called my city's non-emergency line back as instructed, and they dispatched officers to my residence. When they arrived, they informed me that because there is no order for supervised exchanges or a peace/protective order in place, they were not going to be able to provide service as requested. Big fucking bummer, but not the end of the world.

My buddy showed up, I brought him inside and showed him around the place (since my ex knows him I hoped he may be able to vouch for my living conditions), and we prepared for their arrival. They showed up a little bit later, I got my phone out, started a video, put my phone in my breast pocket, and we went outside on the sidewalk to attempt the exchange.

Essentially what happened is I reiterated my stance: They were not welcome inside, and I would be taking our child inside per the agreement that we both signed and that was signed by a judge. My ex and her husband immediately began raising their voices (with my child being held by his mother outside in sub-freezing temperatures) and insisting that they needed to get our child inside because it was so cold out, and they would be coming with him. As I stood firm and calmly/repeatedly reminded them that I had no obligation to let them inside and that it would not be happening, they began making threats to call CPS because I was ""leaving our child out in the cold""; that they ""smelled drugs,"" and then my ex accused me of looking hungover (which is ridiculous considering everyone is well aware that I've been sober for over 2 years).

Anyway, you get the gist -- it didn't go well. It was also a very public dispute, and because of the continuously raised voices on the part of my ex and her husband, someone in the neighborhood called the cops. Before they arrived, my ex and her husband threatened to call them as well, which I encouraged, and as soon as they went back to their car to do so, the police that someone else had called showed up.

Essentially the officers informed both of us that they could not force the child to enter my residence without his mom, but that I was fully within my right to deny her entry and that if she chose to leave with our child, she would be in violation of the court order (which I had printed and brought with me), and they would be writing that into their incident report. They encouraged her to call her lawyer which I believe she attempted but was unsuccessful in doing. She came back claiming that her lawyer stated that, ""If the minor child doesn't wish to enter the residence without her, then she would not be found in contempt of the order."" Literally everybody present knew that that was false and told her that, but she refused to believe it. She then made threats to get $30,000 -- no, *$100,000* \-- from her father to take me back to court.

The officers repeatedly informed my ex that she had two options: Drop the kid off, or violate the order. They encouraged her to pick. I asked if she would feel more comfortable if an officer entered my residence to attest to my living conditions, she thought about it for a minute, but did not budge. Her way or the highway.

By this time it had been over an hour of argument, we hadn't gotten anywhere, the police had another more urgent call, and their involvement was proving futile. My ex agreed to go back to her vehicle and ""attempt to encourage our child to go inside"" (I firmly believed the opposite was going on). After 20 minutes she informed me that he did not want to go inside unless she could join him. I asked if I could speak to him directly, which she allowed, and I very calmly let him know how sorry I was that this was happening this way, that I know we had both been very excited for this day for a long time, and that I hoped we would still be able to have our fun day together. I asked if he also hoped we could still have a fun day together, and he said yes. So I asked him if he felt comfortable coming inside, and he said yes, at which point both his mother and step-father turned around and said, ""But you're not comfortable unless mommy comes with you, right?"" He hesitated, they both shook their heads to coach him, and he shook his head. They took that as proof that my ex was not in contempt and that we would ""have to reschedule,"" and then drove off.

Police returned as this was happening and asked if I  would like to leave a domestic victim statement, which I did. They gave me my copy, handed me a card with info necessary to retrieve the police report, gave me a little bit of a pep talk, and went on their way.

I'm devastated -- absolutely heartbroken. I've been looking forward to this day for years; it finally came, and my ex just couldn't face the music and live a life where she doesn't have complete control over mine.

I know that I handled this the right way and that I now have a slam dunk case for contempt. I hate that this has to be so difficult. To anyone going through anything similar, you're not alone -- this sucks, but we got this. Keep fighting for them kids, y'all.

\----------

**TL;DR:** In the end, police involvement did not stop my ex or her husband from insisting that they had every right to enter my residence. In the process, they convinced themselves that the order ""was an agreement between us, not something ordered by a judge,"" even with police telling them directly that if they left, my ex would in fact be in violation of the order, and that it would be documented in an official police report. I still don't get an overnight with my kid, but I have a slam dunk contempt case and my kid knows I'm not the crazy one."
385,"[TX] My brother had a heart attack at work, colleagues wasted 8 minutes before calling 911 because of a policy that employees can't call 911.","Basically the title. My brother was at work, he collapsed suddenly. His colleagues saw him. First they tried to awake him but he was unresponsive. Someone wanted to call 911 but there's a policy at their workplace that employees must ask a supervisor before they call emergency services. They can be disciplined for not doing so. It took several minutes to get ahold of a supervisor. Once the supervisor arrived, he was not sure what to do and wasted more time calling his own superior to be sure he had the right to call an ambulance, and making sure it was a ""real"" emergency (he's not trained in first aid at all, none of them are, so idk what he was hoping to achieve). A call to 911 was finally placed more than 8 minutes after my brother collapsed. There's video of his his colleagues running in circles and using their phones to try find their supervisor. my brother is unconscious in the ICU, he will very likely have brain damage. At the hospital we were told that the 8 minute delay was critical and almost certainly impacted his outcome. Response times are for emergency services are usually very good in our the area, they would have come much sooner had anyone just called. 

&#x200B;

So I'm here to ask if it's legal to have a policy that your employees can't call 911 immediately when they witness an emergency. Is it something his employer can be held liable for? It's nothing short of criminal imo, I'm livid."
386,[California] I cancelled tattoo appointment because the tattoo artist was high AF. They're slandering me on FB and refuse to pay back safety deposit,"I had an appointment for a huge tattoo that was estimated at about 2000$. When I made the appointment everything seemed fine and professional, and I made a safety deposit of 500$ which is not at all unusual.

When I turned up to the appointment a month later, I noticed the artist was super stoned (red eyes, reeking of weed, slurred speech...) to the point that I didn't feel comfortable getting tattooed by him. I requested a new appointment with another artist. The lady at the reception didn't understand my problem, became insulting and refused to offer me either my safety deposit back or a new appointment. Finally she called somebody else (higher up the chain apparently) on the phone who confirmed they would transfer the deposit back to my account. Stupidly I assumed the problem was resolved and left.

Not only didn't they not transfer it back, they proceeded to make an angry post on their facebook page about how 'some people' just cancel appointments without notice and then have the 'audacity' to demand their money back. For a few minutes the post included a link to my name until they presumably deleted it. 

So here I am with 500$ less and no tattoo, was I legally 'in the right' to refuse being tattooed by someone under the influence - like, would this count as a legit reason? I was honestly worried it would turn out shit. What do I do next?"
387,"UPDATE! Three years ago, my ex forged medical records to lie about vaccinating our daughter and landed her in the hospital.","Hello again everyone out there, [three years ago I made a post about how my ex lied about vaccinating our daughter](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Soon after [I gave an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aw6gch/my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and disappeared over the horizon. I had completely forgotten about making that post as the last few years dealing with a global pandemic and an immunocompromised daughter have aged me 3 decades. But, I saw a post recently talking about my own posts and it came back like a ton of bricks. After wrestling to get back into this account, here I am. I hope you all are still interested in an update.

Well, to give the short answer first, I have full custody of my daughter, and my ex is barred from having any contact with her.

The long answer, my court battle between my ex and me was a grueling process, one of the worst periods of my life. It took over 5 months from the time I got emergency custody to get full custody of my daughter. In retrospect, those 5 months were not as long as they felt, but they felt like the longest months of my life at that point. My ex's harassment at that time got worse, even coming to my house and attempting to force herself in to take our daughter. She was arrested for this and charged with attempted forced entry. Before she could bail herself out, the DA decided to throw the book at her for forging medical documents. She ended up spending a month in jail for this, which unfortunately got our custody case contuned. The upside of this was I was given a protective order for me and my daughter out of this, one that bit her in the ass when we finally got in front of a judge,

I was given full custody of my daughter. My ex and her lawyer pissed off the judge by trying to claim that I had planned this all from the start. Forcing her into a corner to vaccinate our daughter so I could use her response to initiate the custody battle. Her actions, her upcoming hearing for committing felony forgery and forced entry, along with the protective order convinced the judge that my ex was more than a danger to our daughter. She lost all custodial rights, and as of now is not legally allowed to contact her in any form. My protective order was extended by two years as well, but I didn't need it as it was only a few months later she went to prison.

My ex pleaded out, they dropped the forced entry charge and she only got 2 years in prison for the forgery but was still hit with the felony. She was released early due to covid though. Since then, luckily, I have had no contact with my ex outside of getting the child support I am owed. I am not really inclined to keep tabs on her personal life, but I know that she went off the conspiracy deep end. She is now a full Qanon supporter, and dating someone who was involved in the January 6th insurrection. Other than that, she has disappeared from my daughter's life entirely.

As for me and my daughter? The past few years have been a living nightmare. We moved to a new state and I had to put her into fully online schooling. But, our lives are great. And, amazingly, my daughter was able to get the covid vaccine only a month ago and is cleared to go to physical school once the summer ends.

This saga of my life has taught me so many things. I am grateful every day to have my daughter with me, safe and in a place where she can slowly grow and get healthier. It's kinda touching that so many people are interested after all this time in a normal guy like me and my daughter. I genuinely hope this is the last update I have to make. Thank you for your interest, and see you all over the next horizon."
388,"[NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago. My supplier is blaming UPS, UPS is blaming me and refusing to do anything. What can i do?","I run a hobby shop in New York state. I have a supplier who i have worked with for years, who typically sends me my product via UPS. 

UPS has been massively delayed due to COVID, i went from getting orders multiple times a week to basically almost nothing for the last 8 weeks. I had nearly a 100 packages sitting in UPS distribution center, some of them have been forever stuck in the state of ""Out for Delivery"" for weeks now, to things basically entering the black hole of the local distribution center weeks ago with no updates. 

This hurt my business pretty bad (which was already suffering due to COVID) as a lot of this stuff was items people had ether pre-paid or waiting for me to get my hands on. 

On June 26th when i was more or less in bed, i suddenly got a slew of delivery notifications from UPS around 10 pm. Since i live a good 45 minutes away from my store, i freaked out and by the time i managed to get there. The stuff delivered had been taken, i checked the CCTV for my store entrance and probably 10 minutes after UPS dumped the packages some people came by and picked up all the items and took off. 

I made a police report and passed it along to UPS as they had completely screwed up. On Friday i got an update and UPS had closed all my claims stating that it was signed for. The signature was basically the word COVID. Which from my understanding is UPS not requiring signatures due to COVID. 

The following blame is going around in a circle:

* My supplier is blaming UPS and how it isn't their fault, and tells me they fulfilled their obligation and i need to contact UPS. 
* My supplier doesn't have anymore of some of the products, so i can't actually fulfill many peoples orders now.  
* UPS is putting the blame on me stating that it was signed for and is refusing to discuss it more.

Am i able to do anything?"

391,[UPDATE] I live in California and have been paying my rent on time and just got a notice to vacate premises within 3 days,"[Original Thread Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pa7hh3/i_live_in_california_and_have_been_paying_my_rent/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Quick recap: My previous landlord was foreclosed on 5 months in to our lease. New landlord who purchased the property we are renting issued us a notice to vacate within 3 days.

Contacted the new landlord telling them I know my rights as a tenant and would like to stay the remainder of the lease or would be up to negotiating a cash for keys option (at the advice of some of the users on here 😁). Was immediately told that wouldn't be possible because our lease was ""fraudulent"" and we had to leave asap or they would contact the police.

At the advice of multiple people on this sub, I contacted my university (which I attend) who got me in contact with multiple resources. Ended up applying for my city's EPP (eviction protection program) who assigned an attorney that specializes in Tenancy law to me free of charge. 

My awesome attorney managed to resolve the entire matter within a week! Basically told me the new landlords had NO CASE and were more than likely trying to bully me out of my lease. She gathered all of the legal paperwork regarding the ownership of the property and who signed my lease and spoke with the new landlords attorney who basically agreed 100% (bet the new landlords are pissed 😂). 

Ended up getting the new landlords to sign paperwork that same day saying they'd honor our lease. Although, I'm not feeling too comfortable after this entire shit show, so I'll be considering a cash for keys option to find a new place to live (don't want to stay in a potentially hostile tenancy environment).

Basically, my attorney is a badass and I'll be getting her and her team a gift of gratitude! 😁 Try to show your attorney's some love!"

Also  it's where he would bring me and my siblings to give us beatings and lock us up for the night when he was mad at us.

393,Doctor called my mother with test results after I explicitly told them I am no longer associated with her number.,"This takes place in Pennsylvania.

I went to the doctor for a suspected blood clot. I arrived at the family doctor, they had some of my contact information wrong. So we rehashed addresses and phone numbers. When we got to phone numbers, the woman working the desk read mine aloud. I said, ""yep, that's mine."" She proceeds to say, ""and -insert my mom's #-?""

I *explicitly* state that I am no longer associated with that phone number. I ask the receptionist to remove it. She nods. Cool, we are out of the woods.

I get sent for imaging at a specialized facility. Get my ultrasound, no blood clot. Cool, we are out of the woods. 

I get stuck in traffic for about an hour and a half driving home. I got several phone calls I couldn't pick up because I refuse to use my phone while driving. I get home, see a missed call from my family doctor and call them back. ""Hey, it's a negative for a blood clot."" I already knew that but thank you, have a good day. 

I get inside and I was tagged in a Facebook post by my mother. I see she has also taken to messaging me on facebook. ""Hey, the doctor's office said your mailbox was full~ you are negative for DVT 😊""

They notified my mother after I explicitly told them that her number was not to be a part of my contact information.

What are my options here? This is not the first time something like this has happened. I had a doctor at the same facility go into the waiting room and relay everything I begged her to keep secret to my mother, in ear shot of literally every unoccupied person in the facility at that point in time about 6 years ago when I was 16.

There has to be some kind of recourse for this. This is terrible practice."
394,A lady at my gym suffered a seizure in the woman's locker room - she's now threatening to sue. I am 16 years old.,"(Pennsylvania) Hi there,

I am a 16 year old Junior in high school and work part-time at a gym.  I generally open the gym on weekends at 7 AM, and am alone in the building until our housekeeping staff come in at 8:00.
It starts out slow as members come in, and usually picks up around 9 when our Sales staff and General Manager come in.  The gym is a two story facility.

Earlier this morning around 8ish, I was approached by another member who stated there was a woman in the locker room (downstairs) who was laying on a bench shaking and presumably having a seizure.  So I RUN downstairs to the locker room, and sure enough, there is a woman shaking uncontrollably, but breathing.  I had my cell phone with me and immediately called 911.  I stayed on the phone with the dispatcher while waiting for the EMTs and Paramedics who arrived about five minutes later.

The dispatcher stated I should absolutely NOT try to perform CPR/First Aid (I am licensed) or move her, only to hold on to her make sure she did not fall off the bench.  The EMT's manage to revive? (I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term here) her and she gets wheeled out of the gym and to the hospital. I'd say we were in the locker room for about 20 minutes trying to convince her to go -- she was VERY stubborn.  There was a personal trainer who was there to help me with whom I am EXTREMELY grateful for.  I filled out an Incident report and filed it with our GM when he came in.

We have had concerns with this member before, as she has health issues.  The thing is, I have absolutely no idea how long she was suffering from a seizure for.  It looked as if she was in the midst of changing in to gym gear when it happened.  She checked in shortly after 7:15 AM.

I just received a text message from my GM and she is now threatening to sue us for her seizure.  Can she come after me personally??  As I said, I have no idea how long she was in that state for and I am terrified!  Thank you in advance for your answers!"
395,Allergic child in son’s class (NJ),"My son is in full-day kindergarten, and the kids eat lunch and snack in their classroom (not the cafeteria), because there is a child with severe allergies to multiple foods. I first of all want to say that I am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. I can’t imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. At the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so I can’t pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- Parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- Parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. The teacher suggested (but it’s not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/


Again, I am happy to comply as best I can, but I am curious at what point accommodations go from reasonable to unreasonable. 



Edit: Just to clarify, because a lot of people have questions:

- Kids wash their hands at the classroom sink as soon as they get to school, and before and after lunch. 

- Kids *are* allowed to bring packaged food that contains allergens (other then peanuts), just no liquid milk, yogurt or hard boiled eggs, and no snacks that leave a heavy powder residue like Doritos. Kids can get food “delivered” from the cafeteria, as long as it’s not the above mentioned food. 

- there are only two classes per grade, so switching classes is not a sustainable option. 


My kid is doing okay for now, thanks to his love of pita and hummus, which comes in a prepackaged snack cup. However if next week he decides he doesn’t like hummus, or if he is being too messy with the hummus (the kid with allergies is allergic to sesame, which is in hummus apparently) we’ll be in a jam- no pun intended, I think actual jam is okay."
396,[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.

I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.

The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.

How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago. For my share I have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too. Should I find my own lawyer and if I need one what kind do I need? I have an accountant I've used for years but this doesn't seem like an accounts problem but a law one."

This is probably not the most interesting update you'll come across, but I know this forum likes updates so I may as well. 

Long story short, I was contacted by the husband of the woman whose dog caused my crash. He wanted to keep this out of court for reasons related to issues that his wife was going through. It's not my place to elaborate on it but it's something that I understand very well due to a member of my family dealing with something similar. Anyway, he offered to cover my medical expenses/pay for a new bike, I agreed to go this route, and to say that he's been fair with me wouldn't do justice to the situation.

My arm is still a little uncooperative at times, but the doctors I've seen are actually thrilled with how fast/thoroughly I've healed. I'm also still dating the cute good samaritan, which has been an interesting experience since we started seeing each other shortly before COVID took over the world (I'm actually a few towns over from the initial ""containment zone"" in the NYC suburbs) but it's going well and we have an interesting ""how we met"" story to tell haha. 

So yeah, all things this has had a happy, nondramatic ending. Thanks again to everyone who offered advice in my original post."

401,"[Update 2] Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

Thank you all for the wonderful advice, especially the fact that i am allowed to elect someone by proxy to do a unit inspection. I am never going to rent out my room again because this has been a massive battle.

My friend to rent the room for a single night because my land lord never responded about doing a walkthrough in time, and i was nervous. Turns out someone not Jane, but someone who identified himself as Janes coworker who works for Company X, met my friend in the parking lot. He gave him the keys. I don't know who this person is but i am not comfortable with some random person having my apartment keys.

My friend ironically was rejected by the concierge service, who asked him what room he was going to. (I forgot to tell my property manager about this). My friend got a full refund from AirBnB and him and his girlfriend were put up in a nice hotel a few blocks away by AirBnB for the night.

My property manager did respond and was kind enough to do a video walkthrough with me on speaker phone, and honestly my apartment is not in great shape at all. Apparently it stinks of cigarettes and weed, and there was a beer can being used as an ash tray, which is not allowed since our apartment building is ""Smoke Free"". I have stains/burns on my couch which looks like from cigarettes.

AirBNB has not done anything, and her listing is still up (i can't find any other listings of hers).

Jane however has been constantly sending me angry emails, about how i am impacting her financial situation, to how it is making her look bad as an AirBNB host. I told her bluntly the things that i saw from the walkthrough and how it stinks of smoke and we are a smoke free building. She claims she never signed any sort of agreement about condo rules, and i sent her a picture of the agreement she signed, including the condo rules page.

I offered to let her out of the lease, and not pay any more rent money for the remainder of the time on the lease. Skipping Novemeber/December. If she left, and had the apartment cleaned. She on the other hand demanded $5,000 for her to vacate from the apartment early. When i refused she told me ""I will do everything within my power to make ur life a living hell for fucking with me"".

My lawyer has made the complaint with the LTB, and he thinks it will most likely be resolved by the end of December. This has taught me a hard lesson, and i will never rent my apartment again.

Anyways thanks for the advice."
402,[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house,"Hey all, as promised here is the final (barring catastrophe) update. Links to previous related posts below.

Part 2:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bzv7z4/update_someone_ive_never_met_claims_they_own_my/


So it has been a while since my previous update, and I wish I could tell you all that it's because we were involved in a super exciting court battle (""No, YOU'RE out of order!"") but the truth is much more annoying and banal, as life tends to be. 

As we left it in the last post a couple months ago, our lawyer called the law firm who submitted the action against our property and said ""You have no grounds for this, take it off."" The paralegal he spoke to said the lawyer handling the case was out that day but would contact our lawyer soon.

They did not. For WEEKS. Despite everyone bugging them, they were very disinterested in resolving the issue. Color me shocked.

In the meantime, we're getting junk mail from law firms and mortgage management companies at least every 2-3 days, saying they can help us with this issue we don't have. The notices start to be addressed to us personally instead of the this other random guy who said he owned our house. This displeases us. I start keeping a little pile of these letters next to the stairs with copies of our mortgage payments notices from the bank, just in case.

This goes on for a while, long enough for my initial (!!!!!!!) anxiety to fade into more of an ""Eh."" situation. Until yesterday. 

Our lawyer finally got a response to his email from July, where he outlines everything and attached a preponderance of evidence showing we continue to own our house, and their response is, and I quote : ""We will remove the action."" Period. No Good Afternoon, no Sincerely. We will remove the action. A shart of an email after weeks of worry.

So with a whimper, we got what we wanted. Obviously we will continue to monitor everything until they actually do what they said they will, but it is a load off my mind. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you, but it seems in the legal world, exciting = bad.

Thank you all for your concern, your advice, and your upvotes. I hope that if any of you face a similar situation, that reading this can help you figure out how to resolve it.

403,My daughter (8F) came home from school yesterday with individually bagged anti depressants her mother sent her with that I was entirely unaware of. What are my options?,"My ex and I have maintained a, often at times,  highly contentious co-parenting relationship. We've been separated for over 7 years and I strongly disagree with many of her parenting methods. We have joint legal custody of our daughter and she has primary physical custody as my overnights equate to 30% of all overnights annually. On to last night...

As I'm finishing up dinner preparations, my daughter comes downstairs with three individual baggies and informs me she needs to take her medicine before dinner. After asking what medicine it is, she informs me it is to help with her stress. I immediately take the bags and tell her she will not be taking anything that I do not know about. I step outside to call her mother as I am fuming at this point because this is far from the first time I have been uninformed (whether it be school absences, doctor visits, etc.). Her mother proceeds to tell me she has started her on sertraline hydrochloride as a result of her stress levels and panic attacks of late. She says my daughter's therapist and primary physician decided this course of action based on her mother telling them of these alleged occurrences. 

Now her mother is truly someone I believe to exhibit the characteristics of munchausen syndrome by proxy. She has three other children (5, 3, and newborn) with each of them regularly diagnosed with new issues (yes, even the newborn). For some reason I have not witnessed a single occurrence of a panic attack in my daughter and her stress levels, although elevated at times (I mean, whose aren't?) are far from abnormal. 

I am at a complete and utter loss at the moment. For one, why would the first solution to be to put her on anti anxiety/depressant medication? For example, I know her bed times are consistently late (often approaching 11 pm), maybe her ""panic attacks"" are crankiness as a result of often being tired. Two, who in the world thinks it appropriate to send an eight year old child to school with unmarked bags with pills and rely on her to take proper doses at proper times, all without informing the other parent. Three, there is a newborn baby in their household and I can't help but feel her mother is overwhelmed and using this medication as a form of parenting.

Please help! Any and all information is appreciated from the bottom of my heart."
404,I am afraid for my life and those of my children.,"My husband is active duty Navy. We have been married 11 years and have three boys together, ages 5, 2, and 2 months old.

He's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. In December he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. I thought we were going to crash. He pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. When we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. He'd never done that before. The next day I faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. I told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. CPS was called and investigated about two weeks right around Christmas. They closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than I leave him again. (We were separated for Sox months over a year ago.) They said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. Since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. I caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. He grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his DS and left bruises. He has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

We just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. I feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

The only family I have is in Hawaii. We are in California. He has told me he will say I'm kidnapping of I try to go back with the kids.

I have no other family or friends

I have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

When we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and I had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park Inside our military housing. I don't know who took the pictures but I sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. Instead they told him I was causing his career trouble. They didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately I came back last March because we were about to be homeless. I then got pregnant.

Anyway, I want to save my kids. Please tell me how."

If it will be a longer time, then we would like her to be sent to live with my parents or my wife's parents in Mexico.  Is it safe to discuss this with her school, or can that get us into trouble?  How about the doctor's office, is it possible for them to do anything to help her in that case?  Should we write a will, and how do we go about doing that?

Essentially someone stole my current company CEO's identity and emailed me to ask to do a favor from him. We are a small office so this did not seem out of the ordinary. They asked me to buy google play gift cards for a bonus and send them the details. I was out sick and my CEO's off sight a lot so I had no way of knowing it was not him. He also said he was in a conference call and could not call at the moment. So I purchased the cards and sent the scammer the details of the cards.  It was not until the scammer asked for a second batch that I realized that it might not be him. I called the office verified that it was not him. I immediately went to the police and filed a report.  Following this I contacted google and they canceled all nonactivated cards. They said they could do nothing about the activated cards. My company also called the credit card company and marked the purchases as fraudulent as they were made on the company card that they issued to me.  In total, I am potentially out 4700$ dollars.

The worst thing is that I was sick with a fever and had been dealing with family issues so I was preoccupied and why it did not stand out more as a fraud. Anyway, what is the best way to go about recovering the money? Also, am I in danger of any legal jeopardy?

Thanks

I got home late last night and the posts were still there so after walking my dog I called the police non-emergency line again and they said they'd send a car out early in the morning. 

I'm working from home today and sure enough around 8am a cop car pulled up to my neighbors house.  Two officers stepped out and kicked around his front yard where the posts were before going up to knock on his door.  There was about a 5 minute discussion where my neighbor looked quite agitated (couldn't hear what was said) but he came out with some gloves on and pulled all the posts out while the cops watched and he seemed to be shouting at them.  The officers took the posts then one handed him something (not sure if a citation, pamphlet, or something else) and drove away.  Neighbor left for work in a huff about 30 mins later.

Not sure if it's the last thing the neighbor will try but at least that hazard is gone.  Thanks to everyone for the advice.    "
408,I was pulled over for speeding and the officer borrowed my pen and made me give it back to him claiming it was his.,"Hi all, I’m in Florida and was pulled over for going 30 over the speed limit. I was perfectly nice to the officer, and apologized for my speed. He asked for my license and asked if the address on it was current, I told him no, that I had recently moved. He then asked me to write down my current address. I happened to have post it notes and pens in my middle compartment. I wrote down my address, gave him the post-it note and he then asked for my pen.(I don’t know at this point if he knew he was borrowing mine, or if he thought it was his). I complied and gave him my pen. He came back after giving me a ticket and had me sign it (giving me back my pen). I signed and put the pen away in its usual compartment, handing him back the signed ticket. He said “my pen?” And I said “oh I’m sorry that was my pen” he then said “give me back my pen” and I told him “sir, you had borrowed my pen. My father gave me this pen”. He insisted it was his, so I complied and gave it to him. Anyways, he left with my pen. Unfortunately, the pen was a silver pen (probably cost like 100 dollars, it was a nice pen) but it didn’t have anything specific for me to point out it was mine. All in all, I’m just annoyed he was able to walk away with my pen due to his shitty memory and lack of listening to me. What if that had been a 300 dollar pen? Is there anything I can do, like filing a complaint against him?"
409,"UPS driver stole my PS5 right in front of me, and I am mad. No one is willing to help.","This is in Texas.

I was lucky enough to find a PS5 console for sale on eBay in December.  I wanted it before Christmas to give as a gift, but since the expected delivery date was later than that,  I asked the seller if I could get it sooner.  The seller said I would have to pay $40 extra for UPS express delivery, which I did.

The UPS driver showed up at my house and explained that due to COVID they were not allowing customers to sign for packages, so she would need my full name to enter.  She put the package down on the ground and asked me for my name.  My name is complicated and unusual (I am from India) so I had to spell it out twice before she got it right.  During this process she made small talk and said ""you seem excited about this package"".  I said yes it's a gift for my nephew.  She asked what is it and I said it's the new console for the PS.  She said ""what a lucky kid"".  

After writing my name, she picked up the package off the ground, turned around, and started walking back to the van.  I thought she made a mistake so I yelled ""excuse me"" at her a couple of times, but she was obviously ignoring me. She just drove away and I was left standing there.  

I first contacted eBay.  They said that since the tracking shows it was delivered, they can't do anything.  Which is fair, it's not their fault.  I then contacted UPS and they said it was probably a mistake and the package should be delivered to me the next day.  Which it wasn't.  After a week I called again and they said that since it was marked delivered and the GPS of the delivery location is at my house, they consider it done and I can't fill out a claim.  I then contacted the police and they took a report but I didn't hear back, so after a few days I asked them and they said they can't follow up but they will inform me if the item is found.  Which I'm pretty sure it won't be.  

So now I'm at a loss of what to do.  The employee just blatantly took the package and walked away, and no one seems to be able to do anything.  eBay, UPS and the police are all saying it's the other's responsibility.  Unfortunately, I paid with eBay credit so I can't even do a dispute with Visa. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do now?"

So, the mythical arborists do in fact exist.  I've never seen one of their reports before so here it is for your viewing pleasure: [page 1](https://i.imgur.com/AfNmobC.jpg), [page 2](https://i.imgur.com/byBChe7.jpg).  TLDR:  the trees are valued at almost $90,000.  

A lawyer has been hired.  Yesterday a demand letter for $268,000 was sent to the builder who cut the trees down (Michigan allows triple damages for trees).   Popcorn is in the microwave.  Stay tuned!

415,"My Father died 4 months ago, my sister hid it from my brother and I, and we just found 2 days ago. She had him cremated w/o our knowledge and tried to cash in life insurance.. What are our options?","[PA] I get a call 2 days ago telling me that my Father has died back in March. I had no idea he was dead. I track down my sisters number (we havent talked in 3 years) and confront her about it. She said she felt no reason to tell me, my brother, or my Aunt (Dad's sister). No one in my family knew except her. The only reason we found out is because she texted my aunt asking for my deceased Grandmoms social security # so she could cash in his life insurance policy.

She also had him cremated without anyones knowledge, and is now trying to claim we owe her $4,000 for cremation costs. Its to my knowledge that Pennsylvania requires all living children decide on a burial action together?

I also called the life insurance company, as he had no will, and they told me no action could be taken without a death certificate (that she already has, but since none of us had knowledge about the death, we don't have)

It seems to me like she is trying to hide the death in order to collect all life insurance as her own.

What are my brother & I's options?

Thanks a bunch  


\*edit\* I have since called the funeral home, and the Funeral Home Director called me back from his personal cellphone and we talked for about an hour. It turns out he did this all as a favor to my sister because she was friends with his wife. He stated numerous times ""I'm gonna be honest, you could have my ass over this"", then tried to act all buddy buddy with me. My sister could of easily contacted me as my number has been the same for 10 years, and she has seen my mother numerous times in person since my Father died. The funeral home director could of contacted my Aunt, or just googled my fathers name and since I'm named after him I would of popped up.

*edit 2*

Hey guys: So My dad did not have a will, and the listed beneficiary to the life insurance was my grandmom (who is also dead). So my sister was trying to get my grandmoms social sec # and  death certificate in order to take over the life insurance policy.

Also I cant understand why my father was cremated, as he has had a funeral plot already bought and paid for next to his parents that we just had to pay to uncover and put him in. 

My brother and I are also a bit pissed that he was cremated without our knowledge or say so. Do we have any sort of wrongful cremation rights? 

There is also the issue of my sister claiming we owe her $4,000 for the cremation expenses as neither of us approved of it, never heard of cremations costing that much, and the funeral home still has his ashes."
416,UPDATE: A club posted pictures of me online and I want them gone,"The original post didn't get any attention, but updates on this sub are like crack to me, so I'm posting it if anyone is interested.

TL;DR on the original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dvyzxu/a_club_posted_pictures_of_me_online_and_i_want/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share):
I went to a club with friends, I didn't know ahead of time they had a photographer. Some pictures of me were posted of me on their website and Facebook. I asked them to take the photos down, they refused because they were ""great promo pictures.""


Sooo despite some of you guys commenting or PM'ing me things like slut shaming and wanting to see the pictures, I actually received the correct advice!

Facebook was very helpful with getting the photos taken down there. I reached out to their support and reported the photos and they were taken down within a week.

Someone pointed out [this statute](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleI/Chapter214/Section3a)

>Section 3A. Any person whose name, portrait or picture is used within the commonwealth for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without his written consent may bring a civil action in the superior court against the person so using his name, portrait or picture, to prevent and restrain the use thereof; and may recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use. If the defendant shall have knowingly used such person's name, portrait or picture in such manner as is prohibited or unlawful, the court, in its discretion, may award the plaintiff treble the amount of the damages sustained by him.

That pointed me in the right direction of getting a cease and desist letters written. I have a friend who called in a favor with an IP lawyer who handled my case for very cheap. She was also pretty angry about it too when I told her about it, so I guess that was also motivation to help out a broke college kid. 


It took two cease and desist letters, but the pictures were finally taken down within two months. I have a sinking suspicion it cost me a job offer in the meantime, but I'm not sure enough to actually do anything about it even if I could.


Anyway, thanks guys!

I'm not sure if location bot still yells on update posts, so Massachusetts"
417,[UPDATE] My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I’ve been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. NYC.,"First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. I did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

When I posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that I put together without putting in much thought because well I just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and I pretty much panicked.  

For some context, I’ve been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. I’m very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. So while I was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that I stole $3700, I’m wanted for arrest and there’s a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. This is how I was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

So from all the advice that I was given.. I decided to check on this RO and couldn’t find it at all in the system. Turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things I was hearing was true. 

So I got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. My things were everywhere. So I called the police. I let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

My room was indeed broken into and trashed. Many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. I was devastated. I filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

During all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. Turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? Unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. The police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. I was advised that this was a matter of civil (I think) court and I would have to settle this there. They also advised me that I could stay here BUT they believe that it wasn’t in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. So they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else I had left and I am now still staying with my friend. 

As for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything’s that happened. We’re mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

I don’t really have a place to call home now and I pretty much have to start over since I was only able to grab clothes. Even if I did end up grabbing all my things, I wouldn’t have anywhere to put it. In hindsight, I feel foolish for being tricked. I guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least I know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and I find comfort in that. Again, thank you."
418,police officials are forcing me to cremate my daughter,"my (45f) daughter (21f) passed away about a week ago, i have no motivation to do anything. i’ve been talking to many police officials and doctors. i won’t say how she died, but she went on a vacation trip and didn’t come back. her friends called me and she passed away soon after. 

police officers are urging me to cremate her body. i want to bury her, but they keep saying that it’s not worth it and that they won’t allow me to bury her because her body “belongs” to that country. they said the only way i can take her with me is if she’s in ashes. i’m heartbroken, she vacationed in mexico. i’ve tried looking this up, but i don’t find anything credible. can they legally make me cremate her?

edit: thank you to everyone who took the time to reply and anyone who sent their condolences. my husband and i never thought about contacting the embassy. we’re relieved knowing that we do have options. my daughter was a US citizen and she was healthy prior to all this. there’s no reason why she can’t be transported in my opinion."
419,[OH] Sister stole ~$4500 necklace and pawned it for $50,"First, I'm writing this for my friend since she doesn't have an account.

Her sister stole a ~$4500 necklace (that was given to her by her deceased uncle) from her dads house and sold it to a pawn shop for $50.  We don't know exactly when (her sister claims it was months ago), but my friend got [this](https://imgur.com/a/BfmkWyJ) in the mail.  There was a receipt included and the pawn shop should have her ID on record.  Also, her mom and her sister have basically admitted to all of this in text messages and claim they're going to get the necklace back ""eventually""

So, obviously she wants to go get the necklace back herself (since it's unlikely that her mom is going to do it) and file a police report.  How exactly should we go about this?  My plan is to go to the pawn shop, see what info they can give us, then go file the police report, then go BACK to the pawn shop and ask how we can get the necklace back.  We would prefer to not have to pay for the necklace, so could we pay for it and then have her mom pay us back?  Also, what is likely to happen to her sister?

This is honestly a really upsetting time for her and her family, and the top priority is getting the necklace back and I personally would like her sister to face consequences for her actions since this isn't the first time (and probably won't be the last time) she's stolen from family.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: well I went to work and missed all the action before the post got locked so a few things:
1) thank you all for the advice
2) I got downvoted a lot for saying we were waiting until Monday, and even got a few messages telling me we obviously didn’t care that much - we physically *can’t* go until then, we both have jobs and other life circumstances (and honestly, that’s really personal and I don’t think I need to explain why). I understand it’s not ideal but hey, that’s life. Please stop yelling at me about it. 
3) the notice was on a postcard - no mail was opened

UPDATE 8PM EST: necklace has been returned, along with the receipt saying her sister sold it then took it back. Still going to the police on Monday. Thanks for the help again!"
420,Co-worker thought I said something that I didn't and it's grounds for firing due to it being sexual harassment.,"So long story short co-worker complained about something I said. Which I didn't say in the slightest but because of what was ""heard"" by co-worker it's considered sexual harassment. 
Of course I have no idea who heard this what day it was or anything because they want to ""protect"" said co-worker. Anyway my manager told me the story which sounds very unlike me to say in public and at work as well.  Just wondering if I should wait it out after told my side of the story.

Edit: Thanks for all the support everyone, also just a little update manager did me a huge solid and had my back hardcore and no one is getting fired."
421,"New Roomate is actually a family and has taken over our apartment, eating my food, dictating what i can and can't do, now they are being openly hostile towards me and i can't take this. LL won't let me out of the lease, police say it is a civil issue.","I am renting a room in Toronto for university, the apartment is shared between 3 of us, i have a lease for my room and nothing else. I moved into this place in January, and up until May it was just me and the other roommate. In April LL told us a couple (not 1 person) would be moving into the empty room. I was fine with it because i didn't care that much.

When they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. We immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. Landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

Those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the LTB. But it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. On top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

The family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. Last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. He came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

Last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and then trying forcibly force my friend out of the apartment before i called the police. The police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment. I broke down when explaining the whole situation to the police officer, and while he empathized with me he told me it was a domestic issue.

I am sick of this, i want out now. My roommate's lease is up at the end of August but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. I don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

How can i break my lease? What are the penalties for breaking my lease? I offered my landlord 2 months of rent (all i can afford) and he didn't take it."
422,Update to neighbour purposely trying to catch covid 19. Ontario,"So I hadn't heard anything from the neighbour until this morning when her husband stuck something in my mailbox so I talked to him through the window. 

He told me that he was contacted about her behavior while he was quarantined somewhere else because he was exposed to the virus and he got the health unit to make an exception to the no symptoms no test rule in the interest of the health of his wife and kid. The test came back negative 2 days later so he went home to help her. She did have a mental breakdown, he didn't go into detail about it but apparently she hadn't been handling the pandemic well and him being quarantined somewhere else made it worse. 

He asked me to delete the video because she saw me take it and I did. I told him I understand that this has been very hard on people and I had no hard feelings. He said hes going to look into counselling for her and it turns out they go to the same clinic as me so I recommended the counsellor I use. Counselling is basically the same as therapy here.

 He had stuck an apology letter from her in the mailbox with a garden center gift card. 

I'm deleting this account so they're won't be any replies from me this time in BOLA.

Stay safe everyone!"
423,I'm A Cleaning Lady Being Accused of Stealing in PA (contd FINAL),"To catch you up, in case you aren't following my story;
I clean for private residences in my local area. A year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""Mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. I was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! I have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. So I fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. For the last year, I've had to report to the court house monthly And sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that I would NOT accept a plea bargain. My public defender would really lay it on thick too. He would say things like, Sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? Being in jail for something you didnt do. He would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. I was never so afraid in my life! But in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. So we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before I went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-The Prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to NULLIFY!! What?! I damn near fell backwards!! Gone. All that stress, all that needless anxiety..GONE! In hindsight, looking into the matter, many Prosecutors do NOT want to actually go to trial with most cases. They WANT you to plea out so it's over and done with. But I stood my ground, and in my case, it worked out to my advantage. I wish the rest of you the best, thanks for everything, special thanks goes to u/JustNilt for Being so helpful!"
424,"[UPDATE] Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","I am gonna make up some names this time around because referring to people as ""the female seller"" or ""the tenant"" is cumbersome as hell.

After the mess on Wednesday, I met my realtor for dinner and to grab my closing docs. The seller's agent actually wound up stopping by as well (he arranged this with my guy) . He apologized profusely, told us he knows the family and he's confident we'll be able to get things sorted quickly. I didn't get my hopes up but he picked up our tab and bought a round of drinks while he was there, so hey, when life gives you lemons, make a superhuman amount of whiskey? I don't think that's accurate but it was my approach and I stand by it.

Anyway, I wound up speaking with the seller, Anne, yesterday morning, and got the rundown on the situation. It turns out the unwelcome tenant (Bill) is actually her nephew, not her ex's (Charlie). She was absolutely livid with Bill, and promised me the apartment would be vacant ASAP even if she had to physically drag him out herself and pay for movers to take all of his stuff. She also gave me assurances that she'd cover whatever this ordeal has cost. From there, she said she was going to check in with her sister (Diane) who was dealing with Bill as we spoke, and get back to me as soon as she knows something, but again promised that the absolute worst case scenario would be Bill starting to move out by early afternoon.

Maybe half an hour later she calls back and tells me that Diane had rented a truck and Bill was in the process of packing his stuff up. Turns out Bill had recently experienced something pretty fucking awful, and as a result had sort of become preoccupied with seeking approval from adult males. Charlie was at the top of this list; apparently his midlife crisis consisted of buying a Harley and trying to carry himself like a badass, and Bill bought the act hook, like and sinker. And a lot of you guys assumed correctly - Bill cooked up the scheme to basically extort me for a cash for keys deal. From what I was told, Charlie figured a doctor from NYC would just pay out right away to be done with it. For what it's worth, I am not an MD, nor am I from NYC... but you do you, Chuck. Anyway, at this point, Anne threw me a curveball. She and Diane were both at peace with the fact that I was going to pursue this with the police, but asked if I could meet Bill so he could look me in the eye to apologize because she wanted him get an understanding of the fact that his actions hurt a real, live human being. I agreed to it - I was hoping to see if I could get in to check the condition of the place anyway.

So yesterday evening I went up to the apartment and met ""my tenant"" as he was loading up the truck with his stuff. We wound up speaking for a while and... well, I am gonna disappoint some of you here. He seems like a genuinely good kid who got taken advantage of by a legitimate piece of garbage... there were a lot of tears, and innumerable apologies, and I 100% believe that these were based on genuine remorse for what he did, not regret about getting caught. I'll just say it here because I don't think I was being as slick as I'd hoped in dancing around it anyway, but the kid recently lost his father, and I don't see any reason to fuck up his life with a criminal record over a (ridiculously, incredibly) stupid mistake that he was to a great extent manipulated into making anyway. For whatever it's worth, if getting involved in a stupid scam like this was the worst thing that I did at nineteen... yeah let's just say that I was a remarkably stupid and reckless kid. I lucked out and never wound up getting caught in a situation that could have had significant legal consequences, but if I had and I hadn't been given a second chance, I'd be living a very different life right now.

As far as the money goes, Anne and I are going to figure out what's what, and I don't want to explain how because it involves details about her personal life, but the money will technically be coming out of Charlie's pocket anyway. She started by hiring some movers to unload my truck, which is taking place as I type this. Bill left the apartment in shockingly good condition, but I am basing that on what sort of damage nineteen year old me would have passively done to an apartment, so this may be a touch skewed haha. Either way, no damage has been done aside from some very minor cosmetic stuff (a couple of light scuffs from moving furniture and things like that), all of which would become immaterial when I redo the apartment in anticipation of renting it out, so I am not going to concern myself with any of that stuff.

As far as Charlie goes... well, I mentioned in a few comments that My Attorney (who is too majestically vicious for fake names so he just becomes capital-M-My capital-A-Attorney) is a super intense older guy and later found out is a ""retired"" civil litigator who can't sit still long enough to actually retire. Yeah he's out for fucking blood. Turns out Charlie does have himself some assets, and My Attorney is pretty confident that they will become my assets soon enough. I had a brief chat with one of the officers who came by on Wednesday (he's a friend of Diane's, apparently - this everyone knows everyone thing is still very foreign to me), and will be going by the station to issue a statement/file a report/whatever it is you do in this situation. Some of you expressed concerns that he may have fled the country, but the concept of Charlie leaving the county, let alone United States, is very funny to Anne, Diane and Officer Friend-of-Diane. Seems like Charlie is just a dumbshit who thought he could pull a fast one, and will be easy enough to find at one of the local watering holes when it's time for him to be picked up. I absolutely do not believe in throwing around assumptive diagnoses for fun, but I've made an exception in this case and decided that Charlie has full bore antisocial personality disorder because it makes me feel better about things for some reason. 

Anyway I have been typing this piecemeal throughout the afternoon which has essentially been a test of my wife's patience. I'm not dumb enough to incur the wrath of a tiny Puerto Rican woman who has spent the last couple of days stressed out of her mind, so I'm gonna call this a post. Thanks again to everyone on this sub for all of the advice given and sympathies expressed, I'm lucky as hell to have had this end the way it did.

425,Reporters are harassing us after a friend's tragic accident and posting inappropriate photos and quotes. What are our rights?,"I have a friend who was badly injured in a tragic accident. Somehow, the media was on the scene and took photos, splashing them over several outlets with a sensationalized title. They had been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. They camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. We called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

It has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. The last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. Finally, after the 5th call, I asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and injuries, so she can maintain her dignity. I also politely, but sternly, asked them to please stop calling everyone as we were still processing what happened. 

Of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. The one I spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. They did neither. The photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. I told them that I did not want anything I said to be published and that I am an anonymous friend. Instead, they made up quotes, saying that I said she was healing well when she was not. 

Even though I never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. After it was published, I got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when I did no such thing. I was nowhere near the accident. That took another few days to clear up but I felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

This happened in NYS. I have a very low opinion of reporters at the moment. They made my life and my friends' lives so much more difficult in an already difficult time, just to sell a sensationalized story. Do I have legal grounds to sue them for (1) harassing us (we have 2 official police reports with witnesses), (2) publishing nude photos without consent, and (3) misquoting under my full name without my permission?

*Edit to the 1st paragraph to make it more vague, as some have been able to deduce the story, which goes to show how widespread it was. Also, please do not PM requesting the full story. The point of my post was to figure out what to do with reporters that were harassing us. Isn't it ironic if you're doing the same? "
426,(IL) I [22F] was raped by a minor [16M],"(Illinois) Won't go into too much detail about the assault itself, but I (22F) was roofied and raped by a 16 year old, a friend of my brother. I was told that no one would believe me because I was the adult here. 

Wanted to ask - if I go to the police, would I be charged with statutory rape?

I wouldn't report this if there is any chance I would be. Thanks!"
427,"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. I want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.","EDIT:
The title of this post inaccurately states my father was body-slammed. After a carefully talking to the family members present I realized this was not the case. The rest of this post remains unchanged.

A little background: 

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

I also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?"
428,Employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.,"My wife and I work for a hospital (Ontario, Canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. This will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

My wife and I both work off site, where parking is free. Also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

This seems like robbery to me... It has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

Is this even legal? How might I go about challenging this without sticking my neck out?"
429,I am left freezing cold in my apartment - As I pay more than 4X the monthly hydro bill of my neighbor,"In June of this year I moved into a one bedroom apartment in Ontario, Canada. My hydro bills were exceptionally high since moving in (averaging $300-$400 CAD per month). *I am a student - and cannot afford these ridiculously high prices!*

* I am extremely cautious about using electricity because of these high bills, so I rarely use the stove, and I only use lights when necessary. In the summer I had an air conditioner plugged in, and i would unplug it when leaving the house. 
* In the fall month when I did not have any heater or air-conditioner on for the entire month of October and was away from the house for over a week, my hydro bill was still $320. 
* This winter I have a small infrared heater plugged in at the very minimal setting of 15°C in the living room. I have closed the doors to the bedroom and bathroom and sleep on the couch beside the heater, as temperatures are getting to be extreme. I turn the heater off when i leave the house for extended periods of time. I do not use the heating provided in the building because baseboard heating would be absurdly expensive. 

&#x200B;

I had made a few complaints to my landlord (whom i have a number of other problems with and currently have a work order issued for them for other unrelated issues in the unit). I have also called my hydro provider and they told me that my unit has had a long history of high electricity charges and all the past tenants have called complaining about it. At this point I just thought that it might just be normal in the area and that I should give up.

&#x200B;

The other day as I was leaving my unit I ran into my neighbor right across from me. He asked my how I was doing... and how my heating was (since it was so cold outside). Of course I broke out complaining about how high my bills were and how cold I am all the time.

&#x200B;

**He looked at me surprised. He told me his bills have always been around $40-70. He let me step into his house, it was so warm! The guy had a heater set so high, all the doors were open and now I am extremely confused.** 

**He let me take a photo of his last hydro bill (the one where it was fall and I paid $320).**

[**Table I made comparing my neighbors October bill to mine**](https://imgur.com/a/hGDRF74)

&#x200B;

After finding out about my neighbors bill I am convinced that something suspicious is going on. There are only 4 apartment units in the building as we are on top of a restaurant. The third neighbor has also mentioned that their bill never exceeds $80, the fourth I have not spoken to extensively on the matter.

&#x200B;

I called Hydro again and they told me they could have an inspector come and shut off the hydro to the unit to see if anyone else is connected to my hydro - such as the restaurant.

&#x200B;

I am feeling a bit helpless and would like to know if there is anything further that I should do. And if I do discover that my hydro is being bypassed, will I be able to get my money back for all these months (adding up to well over $1000 of extra payments)?

&#x200B;

If the inspector finds that nothing else is connected to me - what other possible explanation could there be?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help!

\****EDIT***!

\- Wow, thank you everyone who has contributed in helping me to solve this mystery! Comments are locked and I've been receiving a number of helpful messages - even electricians willing to come by and check things out!

&#x200B;

\- Basically everyone has agreed that my monthly bill makes NO sense what so ever and that there MUST be an external factor at play (something is connected off of my meter) - at this point, it is just a matter of what that factor could be.

&#x200B;

\- Some people have suggested it is the downstairs restaurant, my neighboring units, the hallway lights/security cameras. Others have suggested it may be that hydro is not accurately reading the meter or the wiring is not properly set up. I have no access to the meter itself to run any of the  tests that you guys have suggested - So I unfortunately will need to rely on the landlord for that.

&#x200B;

\- Some of you have suggested that I look on my online account for usage since I do not have access to a meter- However, others have said that in my area data is not fed directly into the Hydro company in real time - and that looking online may not give me the answers I need.  I am still trying to access my online account to see what's going on - I tried to make an account and it says that my meter number and account number do not match up? Even though I used the numbers from the bill. So I still need to wait until tomorrow to sort that out. 

&#x200B;

\- When the inspector comes by I assume he will uncover the underlying cause- I should be getting a call tomorrow  (2018-11-26) to figure out when the inspector comes.

&#x200B;

\- Since a lot of you have shown interest in what is to come - I will make an update post as soon as the mystery is solved!

&#x200B;

\- If for whatever reason I don't get a reduced bill - some of you have suggested I apply for a government assistance program to help pay the bill  [https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca](https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca/)  (I hope it does not come to that though)."
430,Old homeowners took the washer and dryer even though the offer they signed said they would leave it,"Pretty self explanatory. This is in Kansas. 

We just moved to the a new home yesterday. In the seller's disclosure, the washer and dryer were listed as ""negotiable"" and, since they were pretty nice, we went ahead and included them as part of our offer.

We went back and forth a few times but no one brought up the washer and dryer and eventually our offer was accepted. Yesterday, we got to our new house and they were gone.

We messaged our realtor, who pulled up the signed offer and confirmed the washer and dryer were supposed to be included. She asked the listing agent, who said they weren't supposed to be part of the sale, but were accidentally listed as negotiable. No one caught this or said anything and we were certain we would get them with the house.

My realtor is checking with her broker today, but what kind of recourse could we have here? Would this hold up in small claims court? Is it even worth it to try and get the washer and dryer back, or get a credit from the sellers for a new one? We're just low on cash at this point from the move and really don't need this right now.

I'm not sure if this should go under contracts or real estate, so please let me know if I need to change it. 

Thanks

UPDATE: the listing agent sent us $500 to put towards another set. We just took it and will use it towards a new purchase. Thanks everyone for the input! I'm glad we didn't need to fight over it."
431,"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution."

433,Trespassers called police on me for brandishing a firearm.,"Yesterday around 530 AM I heard a tapping on my window. My window faces my fenced in backyard which has a wooded area behind me. At first I thought it was a lizard but it was more rhythmatic. I went to look outside and as soon as I opened the curtains I see a hand tapping on my window. 

I then turned on my light and started to tap the barrel of my shotgun against the window. The trespassers saw it and immediately darted away. I call the police and a few minutes later they show up and ask where is the person with the gun.

I told them I have a gun and explained someone was trying to break in. They said they were called because someone was brandishing a weapon from inside their house, but I called and reported a break in, not on myself. Apparently the person I pointed the gun at, called the police. 

When I explained the situation, the officer kept trying to finish my story by saying ""You were ABOUT to shoot him until he darted away"" and they filed their report and left.

When I spoke to my sister she explained that the police were trying to help me avoid a brandishing charge because if I can say I had intent to fire versus intimidate then I can't say I was brandishing. 

I had no intention of killing anyone. What should I do? I don't know if I am going to have to defend against a brandishing charge, what about the trespassers? Is it brandishing when I am in my own house?

From what my dad told me - Him and my mom were both surprised yesterday when the nurse came in and said she could go home.  I don't know the exact details of what happened but I know my dad expressed concern and was surprised they were releasing her. To make a long story short, hours after they got home she was laying in bed and my dad could hear her struggling to call for him. He called 911, by the time the medics arrived she was technically ""dead"" already, they did cpr in the house and on the way to the hospital. They managed to get a heartbeat but 35 minutes or so had passed already. A brain scan at the hospital showed lots of swelling and bleeding in the brain. She was placed on life support, but there wasn't anything they could do. From what I understand, her lungs stopped ""working/making oxygen"" which led to a heart attack. 

I'm crushed right now and still trying to process all of my emotions. It's just not sitting right with me that they released her that soon knowing that she was still having difficulty breathing etc after the lung biopsy."
436,"[Update] My dog got into a fight with a smaller dog. Owner asks for $1000 but won't show me vet bills. San Francisco, CA"," **Previous Post;**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update\_my\_dog\_got\_into\_a\_fight\_with\_a\_smaller\_dog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update_my_dog_got_into_a_fight_with_a_smaller_dog/) 

&#x200B;

This happened couple of months ago and I forgot to update you guys. I guess, I just wanted to forget what happened.

Here is the rundown of what I did and what the outcome was.

&#x200B;

I started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and I asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

We went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. He failed and my lovely boy is next to me now."
437,[GA] Got a VERY bad haircut at a well known salon. As my hair is directly tied to my income is it worth it to contact a lawyer?,"Right off the bat, I understand that other people have much bigger problems then this, and I know that hair grows back. Sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I know no one one Reddit can give me all the answers but I’m wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

I also know that there are a ton of points where I should I should have said stop and asked for another stylist but I’ve never had a bad experience with these people and I’m kind of shy about speaking up. 

I had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that I’ve been growing out for 3+ years.  My hair is directly tied to my income, I’m a (hair) model and I’d say I’m probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs I can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). This isn’t including income I would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (I made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

A week ago, I went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch TRIM. This isn’t a Great Clips or Sports Clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. The amount I wanted off was specified both when I made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

I have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. I was assigned a new stylist instead (I wasn’t notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). Everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying I noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). I pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). At this point I was angled away from the mirror. Halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which I now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). I looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. This was probably when I really should have stopped them, but once again I had faith in the salon and five inches wasn’t a huge deal because my hair was so long. When they came back I specifically asked NO shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

I was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and I just hear her mutter “crap” under her breath. I immediately told her to stop and show me the back. I have NO clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my NECK. I asked to speak to a a manager and I was in tears at this point. 

The manager was really kind and explained she was new. But when I started crying she was rather rude saying “it’s JUST hair it will grow back, you don’t need to be making a scene” things along that line. I was really panicked at this point. She offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but I wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

The next day I went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when I was younger and he was shocked. He said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn’t have someone who would eff up that bad and he’d ask around. He also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. I just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style I have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

Then today my moms stylist called me back (he’s been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn’t qualified to work there. He said I should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

The original salon has not called me back at all, but I was fairly rude leaving. 

Question is, is this worth pursuing? I feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it’s just hair. I’m also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn’t a full time career. I just don’t know what to do at this point."
438,"FedEx threw a package over my fence, damaged my car and is mishandling my complaint. They are ignoring it. What should I do?","As the title says, FedEx threw a 10lbs. Box over my 6ft fence and damaged my brand new car.

I called 4 times to get hung up on. Each time I waited an hour on hold.

I finally got through and the employee took down my name, email and phone number and said I would be contacted in within 48hrs by my local branch.

72 hours passed so I called back the 1-800 number again. Two hours on hold and the person on the other end asked me for my case number. I was never given a case number, only that I would be called...

Turns out the first person did not file my complaint for damaging my car and I had to start all over with my complaint. They again, took down my info.

I Asked for a timeframe for when I would receive a follow up and they said they would be in touch, gave me a case number and hung up.

I’ve spent 7 hours on the phone with FedEx. I can’t keep calling back. Damages amount to $800-$1000. This is in California, USA.

Should I call the police and file report? What should I do? Please help.

Thank you.

EDIT: I was actually sitting in my car on a video call when this happened. While I didn’t catch this incident on camera, my co-worker did hear and somewhat see everything happen. Including the size of the box and me trying to get the FedEx drivers attention, but he ran to the truck.

EDIT 2: I tried to escalate the matter over the phone and speak with a manager but after asking multiple times, I only got “due to covid-19 we can’t do that, I’m here helping you now.” When I would ask to speak with specific departs, I would get the same response.

EDIT 3: I DONT have Twitter. I only have Reddit.

------


The first time, I messaged their security and got an extremely apologetic phone call with an invite to come back for a few nights and a comped several hundred dollar dinner in one of their restaurants. MORE THAN KIND, right? He said they could get in a lot of trouble for this, so they wanted to make it up to me.

It's night 2 of my stay here and I ask a waitress for a sprite with mint and lime, I was clear I didn't want a Virgin mojito just in case that was too confusing for the bartender.. a few minutes pass.. She gives it to me, and like an idiot, I take a big gulp. Yup. That's right. Going on 4 years sober and I just swallowed my second gulp of booze, thanks to the same hotels inability to idk, make a soda?

What do I do? I had to unfortunately go through weeks of counseling after the last mistake. I just feel absolutely let down and disgusted with myself and whatever bartender made my sprite..


Update; the head of the alcoholic beverage department called the manger on staff back, which is surprising because it's midnight. He said he'd appreciate if we don't go home, as he will come in the morning to speak to us because he feels this has escalated to a dangerous situation for both the hotel and me. I have no clue what that means but I'm assuming the video they found of them pouring booze into my cup, then the video of the waitress clearly telling me my drink was Virgin has something to do with it, or the fact that this mistake is the exact reason they even invited me back..... who fucking knows. They just had me fill out a statement. I have the drink here in the room with me. Idk why. I just need to sleep, I've been crying on and off for hours because yet again I'm left wondering if 3 years and change of sobriety is now down the drain.... and I need to to forget the taste of that strong ass drink going down my stupid ass throat."

442,Parents recorded my Zoom class and is threatening to sue me and go after my credential because they disagree with my teaching style.,"I am a teacher in California and a student's parents recorded my Zoom class (minors too) without consent.

They are threatening me and my school with litigation and said they will go after my credential.

I do not do a lot of lecture over zoom (I record myself and upload it for the students to work on asynchronously) and instead spend class time for students to work together in break out rooms so they can help one another and learn from each other. In my view this also gives students a bit of the social aspect that they are missing being all at home.

The parents of a student cursed me out and berated me for not knowing what I am doing, and other insults/disparaging statements. They also told me that my class should be 90% lecture. Everything I do based upon state standards/concepts--it just seems they are basing a legal case, or a threat of a legal case, off an opinion.

Do they have a case? Should I worry? It cannot be legal for them to record my class, and other people's children, without consent."
443,"Ex-landlord trying to move people into our old apartment while we're still paying rent on it, and keep our deposit","I live in Denver, CO for reference.

&#x200B;

My wife and I recently signed a lease on a new apartment. We have paid rent on the old apartment up until January 31st so we are not fully moved out yet. We still have some belongings at the old place and haven't finished cleaning it. Our lease ends on Feb 1st. We told our landowner we would be moving around January 8th, so that he would have time to find a new tenant. I already told him that if he wanted someone to move in before the end of January he would have to give us the pro-rata rent for the rest of the month, and give us enough notice to fully move out, and he agreed. I just got a voicemail from him telling me he has someone moving into our old place in THREE HOURS and that they're not refunding our deposit because the blinds are dirty and the garden needs weeding (both things we were going to do before the end of the month of course). Our deposit was $1200. To really rub salt in the wound, the place was a shitheap when we moved in and we made many improvements to it at our own cost, such as fixing broken windows, repainting dirty walls, replacing broken fixtures etc. We have lived there for 2 years and he has consistently told us what excellent tenants we are and how much he appreciates the care we take of the property.

The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.

In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.

The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!

Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was

Heads up this situation has gotten out to the rest of the store (Not surprising)

Any advice on this situation?

446,I just found some pornographic photos of me as a child at my fathers house. I don’t know what to do. TEXAS,"I had to make a throwaway account to avoid being identified. 

I am at a loss for words right now. I feel like my entire existence has been a lie. I have lived for 28 years and now I feel like I even know who I am anymore. 

I was helping my dad and stepmom clean up for a garage sale. I was in the attack and was going through a bunch of old boxes that hadn’t been touched in years. I was looking through one box and there were some photos of me with aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members on my dads side. I had never seen these pictures so I looked through them all. After a few photos, they were just photos of me. Usually alone on a bed. Then there were photos of me naked. And I was crying. I dont really want to go into detail of the rest of the photos I saw. 

My parents were divorced, so this must have happened during Christmas or summer break since that’s when I had visits with my dad. My mom is going to be devastated. I don’t want her to blame herself. She tried hard to allow my dad custody. He was physically abusive towards her, he was wealthy so I guess he had a good lawyer. 

I’m not really sure what my next steps are here. Do I report this? I never had any behaviors from this alleged abuse nor did I have any PTSD because I never knew I was abused. My mind is all over the place and I just feel lost."
447,Tricked into eating something I don’t eat at work. Is this illegal/a toxic work environment?,"This is in Alabama. I’m really really upset over all of this so I’m sorry if it doesn’t make sense. This happened last week and it was only brought to my attention today what exactly I ate and I’m a mess. My coworkers all cook a lot and bring in food for everyone. They all know I have food restrictions because I usually don’t partake (which pisses most of them off because it’s “rude”). One girl brought in a pie and was very proud of herself, saying I could eat it. So I did because I’m a trusting idiot. My stomach was a wreck that night and the next day but I’m pregnant and have a weird stomach anyways so I didn’t connect the dots. There’s been some other shit since and I’m on even stricter rules right now. One of my coworkers was commenting on it all today after seeing me eat my sad work dinner, and said outright that it isn’t the end of the world if I eat the stuff I’m not supposed to because “a lightning bolt won’t come from heaven and kill you”. I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn’t when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I’m so so upset right now. I genuinely don’t know what to do or say. They’ve ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn’t take it seriously and this is just my breaking point. I’m not coming back after I have this baby but is there something I can do legally? TL;DR- Coworkers put something I don’t eat into food and lied about it to me, saying they specifically made it safe for me. Now they told me they did it to prove a point. Do I have legal recourse? "
448,"Witnessed car crash one month ago during honeymoon in FL, stayed around to give report to responding officer. Live in MA and just received subpoena to appear in court in August.","It was the first day of our honeymoon in Florida when we witnessed a car crash. My first instinct was to check the traffic lights at the moment of the crash so I could clearly tell who was at fault. My wife and I hung around the scene of the accident (no serious injuries thankfully) and gave our report to the traffic officer who responded. We felt good about ourselves for sticking around and doing our civic duty and figured that was that. 

Today, over a month later, we both received subpoenas in the mail to appear in court in mid August. The court is located in Florida but we live in Massachusetts. We are also both starting new jobs in the first week of August. 

I would REALLY not like to have to fly down to Florida on my own dime to testify, do I have any other options? Are any of the parties involved compelled to reimburse me for my travel expenses? Or am I SOL and should I just look for the cheapest flight down there ASAP? I’m feeling like that whole “no good deed goes unpunished” saying has never been truer. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
449,"[Update] [Virginia] - I caused an accident, lady I hit refuses to take payout from Insurance, thinks I should pay because I need to ""learn my lesson""","Original thread here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/612803/richmond_va_i_caused_an_accident_a_year_and_a/

The lady I hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. In June they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

In the middle of June she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. I got a letter from the law firm telling me that I was going to be sued if I did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

I kicked the letter off to my insurance company; I first called then emailed it: My adjuster that I was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after I read him the letter. Then a strained chuckle. ""We will take care of this.""

I heard back from them on Wed the 5th - They sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. They apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of June to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

My adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. She has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. According to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: Primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a VERY high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. He collected on her behalf and took his cut.

That's all I know, so yeah. Issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. "
450,"Radiology center mistakenly put ""opioid dependence"" as my diagnosis, and won't remove it from my medical record.","Several months ago, I had some imaging done at a radiology center I'd never been to before.  When I checked the results and report online (which were sent to my referring provider), I see that under the Problem section of the medical record created for me, I was given the diagnosis of ""opioid dependence, on agonist therapy."" There was no basis for this diagnosis, as the radiology center only had the referral for imaging and basic demographic information I'd filled out.  Having a diagnosis of opioid dependence can have very damaging effects in my profession, as my employer is granted access to my medical information, as well as my malpractice provider; and it will follow me in my medical records with any application for any insurance product.

The radiology center apologized for the error, but has left the acknowledged false diagnosis in my medical record adding the word ""inactive"" to it.  I explained that this is still very problematic, as any reader (employer, governing body of my profession, insurance company) will still see ""opioid dependence"" as a diagnosis, and I will not be there to explain that it was an error.  They have since ignored all of my emails.

Do I have any legal recourse to have them remove the error they acknowledged making, which I am really concerned will negatively affect my employment and livelihood (as it is now also part of my medical record at the referring provider).

Thank you in advance for any feedback!

451,Working forcing me to give them (not donate) my blood (Pennsylvania),"Hello legaladvice

I know the answer to ""can my work fire me for....."" is almost always yes in the U.S., but this seems really wrong.

&#x200B;

I'm a phlebotomist in a hospital in Pennsylvania. I report to the laboratory supervisor. Recently I had to have some tests done. We are given a discount for having things that like done in our own hospital so of course I did. For medical privacy, I'd prefer not to go into what exactly, but it turned out I have something rare about my blood. I never told anyone this at work, but everyone found out anyway. My supervisor approached me excitedly, saying that they have to calibrate some kind of analyzer pretty frequently and that my blood worked as a positive control to save on some expensive chemical they have to buy to normally calibrate it. I laughed this off thinking she used my blood once to calibrate her machine. It turns out she is expecting to take my blood on a regular basis (at least weekly is the impression I got) to calibrate this machine. When I told her I wasn't ok with that, she got upset and stormed off to her office. She called me in later and told me I would be saving the lab a ton of money if I did this. I once again told her no. Now she has started dropping hints that the lab is in financial trouble and cuts will have to be made. I asked around to other phlebotomists and she hasn't said anything to them about these cuts.

&#x200B;

So anyway, can my work force me to give them my blood?"
452,My teen sons friend has been abandoned by his family and has been living with us for the last few weeks. What should I do?,"First off, I totally love this kid. He has been an amazing friend to my entire family. However, his mother and step father recently split up due to his step father cheating and his mothers recent addiction to drugs. He has grown up in an abusive household and is underweight as they never fed him. Three weeks ago she dropped him off at our house to stay the night and hasn't returned. At this point it's the best thing for him and he is in no way an inconvienece. He is totally welcome to stay. However, he has one set of clothes and I have been trying to reach his family to get him his stuff but nobody is responding. I really don't know where to start. I want to call police to get his things, but I don't want him to get placed into a foster family. He is in a very fragile state and I wouldn't want to do that to him. Where do I start? What should I be looking to do? I have no way to get him any help because I am not his legal guardian. I really want to get him some counseling and help with school. So, how do I help him? He is currently 15 if that helps and we live in WA state. Any help would be much appreciated.


UPDATE:

Thank you so much for the outpouring of support. I drove him to his house today and spoke with his mother. His mother told him he had 10 minutes to get everything he needed and to get out. So I got to deal with a very hurt child this morning. I think the resounding answer here was to get a family lawyer. So that's what I am going to do. I am going to sit down and document everything I saw. I am also gonna ask that he do the same. He is a teenager and deserves a stable environment which I believe my family can provide. So the end game is that we at least get temporary custody of him until he is an adult. My son has been great through this entire thing and has really stepped up and showed how caring he is. Without him, I wouldn't know half the stuff going on. So I guess we gained a new family member today. I'm happy that he's here, yet disappointed in the situation."
453,Getting evicted because of snoring problem.,"*I originally posted this somewhere else and some suggested I post it here. Based in NYC*


My boyfriend and I have lived in a co-op for about 1 1/2 years now, no prior issues whatsoever. About 5 months ago 2 older women moved into the apartment below us. One of them is large, with a heart issue - and snores like NOTHING we have ever heard before. My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper and nothing wakes that man up. But her snoring? Is insane.

After 2 weeks of waiting it out to see if she would stop, we spoke to our superintendent. He said he knew exactly who it was as multiple tenants had complained about her snoring disturbing their sleep - but because she is “old” with medical issues, he said there’s nothing we can do and suggested we sleep in our living room.

We have tried ear plugs and sleeping with the radio on. The ear plugs didn’t stop the vibrations and sleeping with loud music on only gave me a headache in the morning. So we decided to go downstairs and try to be as friendly as possible - we spoke to her sister who explained that she has a heart problem. We showed her items from Rite Aid that could help, offered to buy them, and suggested a sleep study.

The next day we receive a call from the board saying we need to stop harassing the neighbors and that if we continued, we’d risk being evicted. We tried to explain the situation and they said they received a call from 2 older women scared for their “safety”. 

So we’ve been sleeping with the radio on to try and drown the noise. Well today we received a call from the super saying the board is going to send an official letter out, but we have 30 days to move. Apparently the radio is a disturbance and so is our “loud talking” at night.

My question is, is this legal..? Is there anything we can do..? We are genuinely confused. There is no way we’re going to find another apartment in 30 days."

Detective solved the case! 
Property preservation company is claiming full responsibility. They had the wrong house. None of the houses they owned out there had lot numbers on them in their system so they just ASSumed and went with it. 

Yes my mom is in contact with her atty before she settles. 
There is so much more that goes into this than just $30k worth of missing things. She asked if the DA is going to take the case he said they could but he advised her to contact her atty Monday before making that decision. 

The lake association had their monthly meeting. At which time the president informed everyone that the no trespassing signs weren’t real. So my take on the neighbors is they are just assholes. But the detective called and talked to her so I’m sure they are aware now. I just am ready for it all to be over and I appreciate the amount of notice this has gotten here.

457,Biomother of my foster son wants to sue me for vaccinating (MD),"Hey all. This might come out jumbled since I just got an email about this and I'm very frazzled. I'm sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

My wife and I (also a woman) are fostering a baby boy who is almost two. He was taken from his birth mother because of some child neglect and his mother went to jail. We have been fostering him for nearly six months and are planning on adopting him, unless his mother can make a bid for custody back. She currently doesn't have a steady job and her housing situation is iffy as best so I do not think that is likely. How biological father is unknown.

My son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). He was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. We realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

Last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. He (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. She said we violated her religious rights. (Religion has never come up before.)

We kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). She's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). But today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. He hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

Can she really take us to court? Does she have a case? My wife said I'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but I'm not so sure. What documents do I need to make my case?

Edit: thank you all for the advice! (My wife is now using it to say ""I told you so."") We emailed the caseworker but haven't heard anything yet; it's a Saturday though, so we'll probably hear from him on Monday or Tuesday. I'll let you know if anything changes."
458,Somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - FL,"While vacationing in Key West, FL in February 2018, I was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my California drivers license, and my health insurance cards. I reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name. Apparently I'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the Gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. I'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, OBs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ERs, when I receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long NICU stay for a baby girl. 

In reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. They keep telling me that I need to physically come meet with them, which is fair I suppose, but I live in California and I work, so it's not like I can just hop on over to a random part of Florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. I have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

I reached out to the local police where I live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. I was unable to file a report in Florida, Key West citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and Alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". I reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--I didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. I have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. I reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well. 

At this point, I'm nearly 40k in debt from this garbage, my credit is in the toilet, I'm in debt and financially hurting myself from unrelated medical bills I now have to pay out of pocket. I'm losing my mind at this point and I don't know what to do."

So he said: well guess we're going to the bank and took off without me agreeing.

The bank he got to was not mine, so I had to pay a $4 fee on top of pulling out a $20. I was so rushed because I was gonna be late for work that I dropped one of my very expensive gloves on the ground. He ended up driving me back to work, blaming me for the whole thing. 

Can they actually force me to do that? He didn't have a gun to my head or anything but threatened to call the cops and having the cops show up at my work place would be really bad for me. Can they just drive off without your consent? Thank you"
460,"Gave my two weeks and my new employer is rescinding due to ""company restructuring ""","Half writing this to get advice, half to hear what outcomes I should expect.

I  was offered a role for a frontend dev position at a company. The  company put me through 2 phone interviews, a coding project, and a 3hr  in person interview, at the end of which I was offered a job the next  week. I took it and signed their offer letter. Also had to go to the  doctor for a drug test last week. In addition they made me sign a  confidentiality agreement, which is kind of funny now.

Today  they called me and said due to restructuring a lot of things will be  changing at the company. They weren't clear on their intentions. I had  to seek clarifications and asked them to send it in writing today to  both myself and my recruiter. They haven't yet. They called my recruiter  and left it grey with them. Basically saying, they are taking away my  offer, which I had to pry out of their HR person.

I  gave my two weeks last week, so I'm unemployed come Friday... I guess.  My current job is decent and I never would have done this knowing. The  new employer offered to reach out to my HR team at my current job. It  feels too late to turn around since my current employer knows I'm  willing / looking to leave. Also their off boarding has already started.  I don't think going back is the right move at this point.

I  guess I'm curious what to do in this situation and if the new company  is liable for damages. At the moment my recruiter is reaching out to  gain clarifications and we will go from there tomorrow.

The  negligence from the new company is sort of outstanding from my point of  view. Feels like this new employer is making me unemployed and do not  have to face any repercussions."
461,UPDATE [CA] Parents took and sold my car and won’t tell Me who to. What’s the best step to take from now.,"Thanks for the replies when I [originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77vzo6/ca_parents_took_and_sold_my_car_and_wont_tell_me/).

All I needed was a more with-it police officer. I went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. The officer I dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

I had my car back within two days. My parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. The car was retrieved from the rentee's house. I hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. My mother has been charged, and I've also been questioned about my parents drug use. I'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

I'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

As a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. He'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. I have my car back and my brother back more than I did before.

462,Hospital sent my deceased baby home with me,"
Located in California 

This happened nearly a year ago and I'm very seriously considering suing but I'm not sure I have a case. Here's the backstory. 

I was 16.5 weeks pregnant and went into what was very clearly early labor. Strong and steady contractions lasting about 30 seconds every few minutes. I went to my hospital's emergency room and was admitted immediately. They spent hours checking on my vital functions and giving me ultrasounds for my organs before they finally checked on my baby. I continually asked to be transferred to the antepartum unit for proper care for me and the baby but was denied. By the time the doctor confirmed I was indeed an early labor hours later and she was ready to physically examine me it was too late and my baby was still born. 

After her birth it was clear that I was going to need a D&C to remove the placenta, at which point the question arose about what to do with my daughter's body. After several back and forth discussions the hospital staff informed me that they would refuse to keep her body in the morgue on premises and that we would need to take her with me for the D&C and they would not arrange for the local mortuary to pick her up from the hospital. We directly called the mortuary ourselves and they said they would come pick her up if the hospital would hold her at the morgue, which again the hospital refused to do. The hospital staff told us at that point are only option was for us to take our baby to the mortuary ourselves. My husband had to sit in the waiting room outside the operating room with our baby in the plastic bucket. After my procedure I was discharged and sent home with our baby's body in the plastic bucket. 

The mortuary was completely baffled as to why the hospital would not hold my baby's body. A few weeks after all of this settled down we met with the hospital risk manager and the ER director who both admitted that they did the wrong thing."
463,"[Wyoming] Roommate exposed us to toxic radon gas, what can I do legally?","I (26F) live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my (19M) roommate. My roommate has a collection of clocks and old electronics he keeps in a case in his bedroom. I received my radon detector from a friend three days ago. He had high radon levels (5 pCi/l) in his house, but got it mitigated and now it's down below 1 pCi/l, and wanted to give it to me as he didn't need it anymore. I turn it on, and after the warm up period, see that it's reading 224 pCi/l (not 2.24) in the main room. I move it to my bedroom (close to his) and it's maxing out at over 500 pCi/l in my bedroom. My apartment lobby reads at around 3.5 pCi/l. I did some research and the radium clocks do emit radon, but not nearly enough to cause that big of a spike in radon levels.

I question him when he gets back from work, and he panics a bit, and tells me that he has around 13.5 millicuries of radium. He shows me the cabinet, and there's a vial of radium paint, a lot of shavings in glass jars, lots and lots of clocks and gauges, what he calls ""Soviet radium scales"", old US Army radium disks, and other items with radium. It's obvious how the apartment was contaminated, and I worry the radon is leeching into the rest of the apartments. He's been here and had his collection for over a year. Levels this high are basically unheard of and can cause cancer with ease, so I'm worried I might lose my life over this. Obviously this isn't my landlords fault, it's the roommate, so what do I even do here? Does something like this break the lease and get my roommate and all his radium kicked out? Can I sue him if I get lung cancer out of this? What is my next step?"
464,City removed all plants from our Hillside in the backyard promising to replant them 4 months ago (which they didn't) and it stormed causing our house to flood and destroyed our backyard.,"My City of San Clemente, California decided to remove all plants from our hillside in the Summer ""due to fire concerns"" which resulted in our House getting incredibly dirty from all the dust which was rampant without all the plants. We reached out to the city many times with letters urging them to right the wrong and they promised to replant in the Fall. It is now almost December and a storm came today that has completely flooded our backyard and is doing property damage to our house.

This could never have happened if they left all the plants on the hill. Is there anything we can do for compensation to pay for the damages caused by their lack of action and failure to uphold their promise in the letter they wrote us? All help is greatly appreciated since we cannot afford to take care of these damages.

Edit: Not sure if this is important but the hillside is maintained by our HOA of the community we live in and was a joint decision by the city and HOA to remove the plants."
465,Had to call CVS corporate office to complain about a pharmacist. She found out and is now withholding my medications out of spite. Need advice.,"Two days ago, I went to my local CVS to pick up a prescription. For the last year, I have been able to pick up my refills 24-48 hours in advance with no problem at all. This is so I don't run out of my meds and can take my first dose of my new script on the day that I would have been out. Simple enough right? well, this is where my story begins. This time, the pharmacist refused to refill my script and was forcing me to wait until I was completely out. I asked why the sudden change because I have always got my refill 24-48 hours early this whole time. She said that I never would have been able to which is a complete lie. I said check my records and look because it's always the way it has been. she didnt even bother and repeated that I would have never been able to do that. 

Well, I went home without my new meds. Once I got home, I looked up the policy and indeed, it's company policy that I can indeed pick up my meds 48 hours early. So, I call them back and say, look, this is indeed company policy,and then she started to get pissed and told me to just go somewhere else then if I didn't like it. I called the CVS customer support group and told the support rep about this. The rep contacted the store and when the rep came back on the line, she said that the pharmacist has deleted all my scripts from their records at my request. Thing is, I never once asked them to do that. She was the once that said I can go somewhere else but i never even hinted that I agreed to that. They are now retaliating and refusing to refill any of my scripts because I had made a complaint. I called them this morning and the lady straight up hung up on me. I don't understand why this is happening and Ive never had an issue like this with a pharmacy ever in my life.

So, here I am all out of my very much needed meds and they are still refusing to refill my scripts because I inconvenienced them and now they are holding my health and scripts hostage. I don't know what to do or where to turn. Is there any laws that would prohibit them from behaving like this? it seems like their behavior is illegal. Is there any legal avenue I could take against them? Any advice on this topic would be much appriciated."
466,"[UPDATE] My roommate keyed the word ""pedo"" into my car.","Link to my previous posts can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lm9371/update_my_roommate_keyed_the_word_pedo_into_my_car/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lk1pyg/my_roommate_keyed_the_word_pedo_into_my_car/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

First things first, I went down to the Chesapeake General District Court on Thursday and filed a civil suit against my roommate for over $2500. I overnighted my copy of the summons to him, and when they arrived on Friday, I slid it under his door since it is technically his mail. Also, when I got home from work last night, I noticed that the sheriff's office had left their copies of the summons attached to the screen door. At the advice of the civil clerk of court, I am not touching it.

I have an update on my car as well. I received a phone call from the collision center yesterday, and my vehicle is ready to be picked up. I am excited that I am going to be back into my own car.

Last, but not least, I am pretty sure that my roommate has moved out early, even though he wasn't due to move out on the first. The only reason I say this is because he hasn't been here in 2 1/2 days, and the security camera he had watching his vehicle is not in his window anymore.

Thank you all for the support. I will make sure to keep y'all updated on the civil case."
467,[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not. 

&#x200B;

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents. I, however, do not care what happens to them –– I have forgiven them once before for crossing the line with credit cards, so I do not care what happens to them now."
468,An (update) I hoped I'd never have to post--my daughters mother has passed.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ek0lyl/update_nearly_3_months_later_about_the_kid_i/ (which links to my OP) 

I got a call this morning telling me that my daughter's mother had passed away; no other details at this time, most likely an overdose. 

I've recognized it as an inevitability, but I also hoped for a miracle for our girl's sake if not her own. You always cheer for people you loved at one point and especially so in this case. 

It's mixed relief and deep sadness. Legally there are going to be some things down the line here that will fall to me to deal with on behalf of our kid and I'm sure it'll come with questions I'll rely on you for. 

Our girl doesn't know yet; I let her sleep in this morning and she's still asleep. I don't know how I'm going to tell her and that's the part that gets me. She's going through some stuff of her own right now and this was the last thing I wanted for her."
469,My car was hit by two kids on a Go-Kart and the police didn't take any of their info,I was working as an uber driver with a passenger in my car when 2 kids (11 & 13) ran a stop sign and hit my car. The police showed up and didn't take any of their info and now my insurance has declared the car a total loss with nobody to go after. The only lead I have of them is the ambulance records of that day but when I called they said they can't release any info because of the HIPAA laws. What could I possibly do in this situation? I've been out of work for 3 weeks now and I was trying to save up because I'm starting flight school soon. BTW this happened in Florida.
470,UPDATE: I am the mother who disbelieved her daughter’s sexual abuse.,"More than a year ago, I posted a message here on the advice of my son. I’m not sure how to link it but you can view my post history. Location is Washington.

My daughter disclosed sexual abuse to me from my now ex husband, and in shock, I made every mistake possible. Not only did I doubt her, I was convinced she was lying. 

There is no excuse, but my children are better than I deserve. I knew immediately that I had to reevaluate. The day after I first posted, I rented a room away from my husband. I called my daughter on the phone and we spoke for hours. We both cried and I apologized. If we were in the same city, I would have thrown myself on my knees. I told her I loved her and she said, “I know. I love you too.” She asked me to see a therapist and I agreed. I also called my son and thanked him for being there for his sister when her own mother was not.

My children actually suggested this update, although they understandably want details about legal proceedings to be kept private. I still feel both disgust for myself and awe that I have their forgiveness and love despite how I failed them both, but we have worked through so much pain and we are a family. 

Thank you for your honesty and being the first to open my eyes."
471,"[MA] Landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. Cites ""illegal activity"". Does he technically have a case?","So, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

Do I need to take this seriously, or can I start coming up with more ways to say pound sand? What should I do if he does try to take further action?"
472,Neighbor took our dog to the pound without telling us,"This is happening in Maryland.

My neighbor trespassed in our back yard this morning and took our dog, a Jack Russel Terrier, to the shelter. We have her on video from our outdoor cameras taking her.

She admits to taking her, but is refusing to tell us where the dog is, she simply said the dog was at the pound, in the shelter, etc.

The police have been less than helpful with this situation, and we are in the process of contacting all the shelters in our area about her actions.

What are we capable of doing from a legal perspective in this case?

UPDATE: Dog has been located at a shelter, who have agreed to return the dog to our care after seeing the camera footage to prove she was stolen. Motive still remains unclear on the neighbors side.

UPDATE 2: A lot of questions about the dogs living conditions.

She is fed, healthy, regularly walked, active, and sees a veterinarian once annually. People in our neighborhood see our dog walking almost every day, so they’d back us up on the dogs living conditions.

The dog is considered an indoor dog, but gets a lot of outside playtime, and as stated before, she is regularly walked. We have NEVER left her out of the house at night, in the rain, snow or anything of that sort. We have also never left her outside when we aren’t home.

This morning she was let outside so she could use the bathroom, and run around a little bit, but none of us were watching from the windows, we have high fences with no gaps and a gate so she can’t escape so we aren’t superstitious about leaving her unattended.

UPDATE 3: Our dog is back home with us now. We have acquired surrender documents from the shelter and they prepared us a copy of their security footage of the neighbor on a flash drive.
The documents are written as if she was the owner of the dog. Stating she “can’t afford her anymore”

We have spoken to police again, this time at the county level. We filed a report with them and my parents are pressing charges. 

There was however one problem, the woman tried to find and remove the microchip which is implanted in our dog. There were cuts in the dogs skin that the shelter employees discovered while trying to scan the chip. Our dog needed bandages, which the shelter applied. The chip is intact, and is still implanted, but I am pissed that she went as far as to try to do that herself.

We have not spoken to the neighbor since leaving but we are not letting our dog outside alone for a long time, and one commenter suggested putting locks on our gates, which we plan to do."

474,"UPDATE: I won my case against former employer, without a lawyer. It's been almost 3 years. I want to thank the community for the direction/advice.","Update: in May 2015 I resigned from a 13 year job, due to harassment caused  by a new employee, cousin of the business owner. Former employer realized he didn't have a non-compete and in hoping to keep me away, filed a frivolous lawsuit, fueled by his cousin's lies about me. I initially hired a lawyer, and after the first month's legal costs of over $6k, I realized I could not afford a lawyer and defended Pro Se. I made mistakes, but in the end I survived the almost 3 years since this shitstorm started, and finally got the case dismissed.
I feel like a huge weight has been lifted. I'm bruised and broke, but you should see the other guy (I know he spent over $150k in legal fees alone). 


Edit: Case was in Federal Court, Louisiana.


Edit 2: since the update threads are locked by default, I'm going to add here my advice for others in similar situations, since it appears to be a common question in the PMs I'm getting.


First: look really hard into getting a lawyer, even if only for initial settlement negotiations. A lawyer MAY get your case dismissed in the incipient phase. The initial month I used a lawyer gave me the general direction I followed after. It helped me discover some of the tools I needed to use later. Unfortunately, my former employer got stubborn and it became a pissing contest. 

Things I've learned and I recommend: Read (download) the Rules of civil procedure, and the local court rules. Do not let deadlines pass! Better file something incorrectly than not file, when an answer or action is expected of you. You will have the chance to fix errors later. Have a witness(es) willing to write a declaration stating that your version is correct. Use affidavits/declarations to get your evidence admitted. Also - read the Rules of evidence!

Submit subpoenas, and take depositions! This is what ultimately helped me!

Good luck, all! "
475,"I'm in accounting, I uncovered serious fraud by my employer and they fired me. How do I report it and how do I protect myself?","I work in accounting in a private company. Two weeks ago I was given documents to work on. I wasn't supposed to have access to these documents. Actually they were given to me by my manager because he wasn't doing his job. He was very late on something, which often happens, and asked me to take care of it instead. I did and started suspecting something was wrong as there were fishy discrepancies with invoices. I investigated a little on the side, which I now regret doing. It's very clear someone at our company is committing fraud, I suspect on a large scale.  I was in possession of the documents for two days before my manager asked me to give him back everything and wipe some files from my computer ""for safety reasons"", which I did. He said my help wasn't required on this anymore. He didn't say why. The day before yesterday I tried to log in on my work mailbox from home on my phone but couldn't access it. Yesterday as soon as I got in my boss called me into his office and I was told they are firing me for not being productive enough. No other word. I was escorted out, they kept my work laptop, I can't access my mailbox anymore.

Now I need help because I'm freaking out. I uncovered fraud by accident, and I'm certain it's the reason I'm being fired. First thing, I think it needs to be reported (to the IRS or another agency), but I don't know how to do and I don't have much evidence anymore as I didn't download anything. And if I do this I'm scared I may be considered an accomplice because at first I hadn't noticed that some things they were doing were illegal and there's proof I authorized some payments.  I did what I was told and didn't suspect anything but I don't know how that could look like for an investigator. There's also the question of confidentiality if I talk to someone about company matters. The files that I accessed during my ""investigation"" weren't protected but I wasn't among the people supposed to see them either. Could I be prosecuted or sued for this?

Then there's the matter of me being fired, it's putting me in a very difficult situation. I think it's retaliation but I don't know what to do with this. Can I file for unemployment?

I'm in this way over my head, any help will be greatly appreciated.

476,Hospital gave my Mom's jewelry to another patient.,"My mom, (84 y/o) recently suffered a stroke and was in ICU for 3 weeks. She went in wearing her wedding ring a diamond/24ct gold bracelet and other gold jewelry. (Approx $4000 worth of jewelry). The hospital staff gave my dad (86 y/o) a bag with her personal items in it. My dad suffers from dementia and is not fully mentally there. When one of my sister's took a look inside the bag, (which was a few days later), she noticed that there was a separate bag for the jewelry but this bag did not have my mom's name on it it had a different person's name on it and it was cheap costume jewelry. 

&#x200B;

We notified the hospital and gave them the jewelry that did not belong to my mom and asked what they were going to do about her jewelry. We were told that the only thing they can do is wait to see if the person it was given to returns it, if they do then the hospital will notify us, if not then they were not going to take any further action. 

&#x200B;

One option my mom can do is file a claim with her Home Owner's carrier, unfortunately she has jewelry limitation of $1000 and none of her jewelry was scheduled so she would be out the amount over the limit. We have filed a police report but they aren't going to do anything about it, we just filed it for insurance purposes. 

&#x200B;

This happened in Washington State. I'm not sure what else we can do. My mom still cannot speak or write so she can't give any sort of statement. She is cognitive though, enough to know that her jewelry is gone."
477,Priest broke confession seal and told husband I cheated,"I cheated on my husband three years ago while traveling for work. It was a one night stand and we didn’t exchange numbers or keep in contact. I don’t even know his last name. 


Until last month, I’ve never told anyone about this event. At the time I cheated, I didn’t really care because my marriage was rocky and I felt unappreciated. But my husband and I reconnected during quarantine and I started to feel extremely guilty. 


Last month, I thought I would try going to confession with my parish priest. He said I needed to tell my husband as part of my penance. I wasn’t really sure how to do that, so I’ve sat on it. 


Last weekend I came home to my husband throwing all of my stuff out of the bedroom and trying to kick me out of the house. He knows everything. Apparently the priest followed up to see if I’d told my husband, and when my husband said he didn’t understand what the priest was talking about, he told my husband about the affair. 


My whole world is exploding because I thought confession was supposed to be private. Does the priest have any kind of liability or responsibility?

478,"[Texas] I am a felon. I was hired through a ""Temp agency"" that helps people find jobs. I let them know that I had a felony upfront. Worked for a warehouse, was offered a permanent position. Signed an ""offer of employment letter"" then was fired because of my record after the 2nd background check.","As the title says. I am a felon. {Less than a gram charge in 2013-I was a 22yr old punk...} I am now a 28 year old man, and that life is long behind me. I paid the Piper in FULL for it all and have been deeply humbled.

With that being said, I was completely honest with the agency with my record, I made sure they knew this. 100%

This job finally stuck. It was a performance numbers based job. I received electronics and entered information into a computer. You were suppose to scan 8-10 items an hour with a certain error rate.

I always made my numbers. Was even one of the top ""receivers"" on the floor. I averaged 120-150ish scans a day, my error rate was very low maybe 3 ""tags""(errors) in total. because I wanted to prove my worth.

I was never late. Never called in. Came to work and produced. 

My manager was even a family friend that got me the job. He knows my whole history. 

The only reason I posted this was because my old man called me up and said he spoke to his friend who is a really smart 22yr Veteran of the Military. (So is my pops) about my situation. The friend mentioned to my old man that it sounded like ""discrimination"" and I should see a lawyer.

I signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check I received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. Even though I was upfront with my record.

Do I have any kind of legs here? Or is this just what I should expect until I can get my record expunged? 

Kinda shitty man. This job was the best thing that happened to me... I was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. Idk. I don't want any boo hoo's for me. I know I'm a good person.

I felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. I understand if I provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. But I knew I had something to prove and I did just that. Which is why they offered me the position.

I was in that warehouse for 3 months... There background check went back 7 years....

This really set me back financially and honestly my manhood was defeated a bit, but that's life.


Is there anything here for me to pursue? 

Thanks to anyone that can help. Have lovely day everyone!

479,[UPDATE] Employer didn't pay several of us for a day when the company was closed. You guys helped me and several others get paid. Thank you!,"So after some research and still not quite understanding the law here in Florida, I made  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/afjeis/im_an_exempt_employee_in_the_state_of_florida_my/) a little while ago.  The answers were right along the lines of what I was thinking and gave me the confidence to go to my employer and demand payment.  I was a little worried about retribution, but I figured the law was on my side so wth?

Not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  No signs of retribution either.  It turned out (at least this is what I'm being told, so who really knows?) that the HR manager misinterpreted the law.  Once this person read it again, they started to have doubts themselves, then contacted our corporate lawyers who told the HR manager that we must be paid.

480,"The guy we're living with threatens to kick my mom and I out of his apartment if she doesn't have sex with him. She and I are not on the lease, and we have little money and no where else to go. Can law enforcement help us?","My mom and I have been living with a guy for a few years in Arizona. (Let’s call him Bob.) We were in a tough spot when we moved in. During a date between him and my mom, my mom told him about how she’s been looking for a place to live (since she was running out of money and couldn’t continue to afford renting a house we’ve been staying in for a year). He offered for me and her to stay at his apartment.

Bob used to be nice. He told my mom, ""I know I'll be in a position of power, but I'll never abuse that."" He let her recover from a car accident she was in, while I finished high school. He was letting us live there for free. (My mom bought our own groceries, though.)

Eventually my mom started getting better and wasn’t bedridden all the time. That meant she wasn’t lying in Bob's room and being by his side 24/7. (He is very lazy.) He starts to get jealous when she’s talking on the phone, and tells her to come into his room if she’s out in the front room at night.

Fast forward and I get a job to start paying Bob to live there. I pay about $100 every 2-3 weeks for electricity (We’re in Arizona so we have SRP). Really cheap. However, my mom is unable to work because she’s still trying to recover, so she can’t pay anything. So what begins to happen is Bob saying we both owe him for allowing us to stay with him since he’s letting us live with him for free. So instead of needing to pay him more money (I was only working $11.70/hr 32 hrs/week), he proposed to my mom (My mom told me about it since it was between him and her) that she have sex with him as an alternative form of payment.

Fast forward and now it has become a rule, regardless if we pay him more money. If my mom doesn’t give him what he wants, when he wants, how he wants, he yells at my mom all night and doesn’t allow her to sleep. He does this everyday, every night. And he blames her for it and thinks he’s in the right. He even blames her if he decides to drink.

She’s tried working, but since he keeps her up all night she can’t go to work due to being extremely tired.

My mom has plenty of recordings of him saying that he’ll kick us out if he doesn’t have sex with her, but what can we do since she and I don’t have much money and nowhere to go? If he gets arrested, what does that mean for us? We’re not on the lease, so it’s not like we could continue living where we’re at. And we can’t go to a domestic abuse shelter because they’re not accepting any more applicants because of COVID-19.

I’ve been unemployed for a little over a month and am trying to get a job right now. I was social distancing since I was sick with what I’m very certain was COVID-19, but now I’m better and am trying to get a new job. But I just can’t take this anymore. I don’t know if law enforcement can make our situation better, considering what we have stacked against us.

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just woke up to my post receiving a lot of attention, so it'll take a while for me to get around to everyone. I forgot to mention that my mom and I have two dogs, a freezer chest, furniture, and food of ours we need to get out as well, which makes getting out a bit more complicated for us.Also, another tidbit of information for anyone suggesting that we go to a shelter: I'm a male.

481,"[Massachusetts] Neighbor's and their friends are trespassing on my property to get to lake via my private dock, what liability am I looking at?","I recently purchased a lakefront cabin with a private dock. The cabin is located at the end of a peninsula. This Sunday, I visited it and discovered about 10 people on the frozen lake and a giant pickup truck parked on my property.

As I was getting out of my car, the neighbor (whom I never met) walked passed me with her two dogs and a pizza and approached my dock. I saw a guy from the group of ten meet her on my dock and she gave him the pizza.

I told them they were on private property and that they were trespassing (even though there's signs saying so) and the guy seemed understanding, but the neighbor replied ""I've been doing this for 8 years.""

At which point, I replied, personally I didn't care, but what I didn't want was the liability of someone possibly getting hurt. They didn't reply and I left it at that. They did move the truck but I left so I don't know if they moved anything back or continued to use my dock.

What kind of liability and I looking at here? How should I best protect myself? Also, in Massachusetts, the Attorney General has decided not to prosecute some crimes, trespassing being one of them. I don't know what bearing, if any, this may have.

482,My old boss is hellbent on getting me fired from my new position,"**Cross post from r/relationships. They told me to come here for advice. It is a wall of text but I needed to make sure I had all the important information.**

Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

Edit: for u/commonWerewolf

Firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before I left that as soon as I was done with school I would be moving on fairly quickly. She was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

My last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. One of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. We also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before I would be done with school.

My 2 months were approved by HR and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. She said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as I HAD been reeling back my duties. The new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

My manager knew I hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that I really needed a break because in those 5 years I had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. Most of the time I was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok I was a grad student didn't really need one. I missed out on a lot of things because I was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

When I went on my vacation I was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that I could get a call that I could not turn down.

Also, when I did put in my 30 day notice, I did call and I talked with her. I told her I was more than willing to start my 30 days when I returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

I have done everything professionally and by the books. I always conducted myself in the most professional manner I could while improving patient care. We had replacements picked out a whole year before I left. The two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why I stayed so long.

And yes I said that to my friend because I genuinely didn't care at that point because I had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. So I wasn't so beat up about her being upset after I had the go ahead to leave.

I would love you to respond again because I do agree with what you have to say and any insight is perfectly valid and wanted!"
483,The courts granted a restraining order against my abuser and then accidentally sent my sealed address to him in the mail," I went to court earlier this year to get a restraining order against the man who stalked,  drugged, and raped me multiple times, when my husband was deployed. I bought my first house a year ago, meaning I can’t up and move easily. I specifically had the courthouse seal my address so that he wouldn’t find out where I live now. 
The court granted the restraining order due to the “severe mental and emotional pain he has caused me”, in the judges ruling. 
He filed an appeal which he lost. The appeal judge ruled that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence against him. So when they sent out the appeal memorandum letting me and my abuser know he lost.. they, by mistake, sent him my address... 
I need advice.. I can’t up and move, my husband is military and has to travel a lot.. I am disabled and scared. 
Is it possible to sue the court that gave him my address? If so, what kind of lawyer would I need to talk to?
Just for reference, I live in New Mexico, in the US."

485,Utility tree cutter threatened to come onto my property and “cut down all of those maples” [MA],"
Hi, folks! We received notice last week that the utility tree trimmers would be coming to our region to cut branches near the power lines. We are fine with that and have had that done before for some ill cedars, at our own expense, last year when we moved into our house (which we own). Yesterday, I heard them trimming trees and saw they had essentially cut down a tree on our property to a three foot stump. I went out to speak with the cutters and asked them to be more sensitive to the cutting and that they left me with a near dead tree I will have to pay to remove and stump grind. This tree, about seven feet tall, was more than 20 feet from any power line and was fully on my property. After him telling me he was just doing his job, I asked again for him to not do this to the other trees, he said, “If you don’t watch out I will go and cut down all of those maples” and pointed to a full grove of trees nowhere near a line and fully on our property. I told him that I found this to be a threat and asked him to not come onto our property. They eventually left and I filed a complaint with the power company. Their arborist is coming today to review the issue, and the manager from the tree trimming company is coming, as well.

I found this individual to be threatening, but does this constitute a crime or illegal activity? Can I forbid the tree company or this individual from coming onto my property if I felt threatened by his actions or words? And what about my poor sapling? It was a maple that I tended through the last year that was there when we bought the property. Thanks! And again, this is all in Massachusetts.

Update: Thank you all for your kind advice, and I greatly appreciate it. I wanted to update you on the meeting with the arborist and the manager from the tree trimming company. The three of us visited the tree (now a stump) in question, and I explained my perspective. The arborist attempted to defend the person who made the threat, but I pointed to the trees that the tree cutter had referenced, and he agreed they were not near power lines. He apologized for the incident, and I thanked him for his apology. He said that they were under contract with this tree trimmer for all services related to protecting powerlines from tree falls and branches.

I told both individuals that the threat made by the trimming company had made my family and I feel unsafe and then stated that because I did not know the individual who made the threat, that any employee of the tree trimming company (a very large company here in New England) would be tresspassing if they entered my property for any reason. The arborist said that the trees would need trimming, and I said that they were more than welcome to identify a different company and to meet with me before said trimming to discuss their plans. He verbally agreed to this. The tree company individual apologized for his employee's actions. I thanked them for meeting with me. I will need to file a formal complaint for stump grinding, and I will update once there is resolution. Thanks again, all."
486,Buyers back out of a home sale due to possible undiscovered mine under our neighborhood.,"You can’t make this shit up. This happened in Meade County, SD near Rapid City. We moved mid-April across the country for my job, and like anyone would do, we sold our house. Our neighborhood is nicely developed, and prices have jumped way up since we bought 5 years ago. We bought for $185K and sold (within 24 hours) for $249K. As you could imagine we were elated.

Fast forward to last week. My wife sees on the news that there was a sink hole down the road from our house. I didn't think much of it and thought that it may be inconvenient for the home owners affected, but thought the city would repair it and be on their way. That's when everything started to go to shit (like is the theme for this year).

We saw this [https://www.newscenter1.tv/two-sinkholes-in-black-hawk-led-to-discovery-of-a-potential-gypsum-mine-thursday/](https://www.newscenter1.tv/two-sinkholes-in-black-hawk-led-to-discovery-of-a-potential-gypsum-mine-thursday/) article. Apparently, there may have been an abandon gypsum mine underneath our neighborhood from the 1920s, 12 homes have been evacuated, our buyers have backed out of the purchase agreement 12 days before close, and we don't know if our home is now worthless.

They don't know a lot of details about the mine’s origin, if the company that owned it still exists, if the developer or the county even knew about it, or how many homes are really affected.

My questions are what are our options? If we can't sell it, who is at fault and how can we get compensated for what was seemingly a done deal? I know the buyers were legally allowed to back out and I'm not interested in pursuing that, but would the developer or county be legally required to compensate us for this? I'm obviously going to lawyer up, but i just wanted a baseline before starting 2 -way with a lawyer and starting to rack up fees. 

Thanks in advance.

TLDR: 2020 sucks ass!

Edit: Added location

Edit 2: Thanks for all the tips and advice. The neighborhood is meeting tonight to discuss possible legal action and a way forward."
487,Can my parents force a pregnancy test?,"My wife was sexually assaulted. She got pregnant, and the baby could be mine or the rapist's. We decided to keep the baby and raise it as mine. We never want to have a paternity test done on the baby because this could be devastating to her relationship with my wife.

I'm a massive moron, and after my daughter was born, I let slip to my parents that she might not be mine biologically. I tried to backtrack, but my parents kept pushing and pushing until my wife sat them down and explained the situation. They do not believe her. They think she cheated and that she is using me.

Now my parents have approached me about taking a paternity test. They want me to contest paternity and leave my wife. I do not want to. I made a commitment to my wife and daughter and I stand by it. I trust my wife, but my parents don't. They told me that if I refuse, they will go to court and compel me to do a paternity test to absolve me of responsibility for the baby. They want me to leave my wife regardless.

I am planning to cut contact with my parents over this, but is there any way that they can legitimately force me to do a paternity test? Is there something I can do to prevent this or fight them?

We are located in RI.

Edit: The title is supposed to say paternity, not pregnancy. I'm still a moron."

489,Update:https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9pvzr8/im_going_to_sound_like_a_busybody_but_am/,"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9pvzr8/im_going_to_sound_like_a_busybody_but_am/


So, first, I didn't appreciate all of the nasty messages I got from people insulting me and berating me and saying that I was trying to ruin this family by calling CPS.  Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that some CPS workers have made poor decisions, but you're in idiot to not utilize it when it's appropriate. Along with those messages, I got quite a few from people saying they grew up in similar situations and had been indeed been molested and to please call and to put this in the hands of the authorities.  

I never personally thought that the girl was getting molested; I just wondered at what point this creepy emotional incest is deemed inappropriate. So I went ahead and called and when I said the woman's name, the worker said, ""Oh, she works at *****?"" So, she was already on the radar.  I told her what facts that I knew about that I thought were concerning.

Yesterday the coworker went on a rant about how she's being persecuted, that CPS is on her case again- again, after previous complaints about the child pooping repeatedly in the neighbor's yard when she was a toddler and something else about food stamp fraud getting her checked out by CPS a couple of years ago.  

There was a long convoluted conversation. I have to listen to this self-absorbed narcissist talk about herself endlessly and never say anything, just try to disengage as diplomatically as possible and get back to work.  But CPS wanted to see the girl's bedroom and they said she slept in the attic, which is a pull-down trap door. Which is never actually used and CPS was well aware of that. When the breast feeding topic came up, I was like Oh, she still breast feeds, huh? And get this, she said that at her age, she can no longer ""latch on"" and actually get milk out of the breast anyway. It's for bonding purposes. 

The bed thing......I thought it was super obvious before that they were having sex with her in the bed, which I personally find disgusting, but in the last post people seemed okey-dokey with it. So, I asked her, Isn't it hard to get any privacy for sex? You see, I'm not holistic and could not understand that it's a worldwide practice for parents to have sex in front of their children and it takes away their fear of death. Fucking gross. THREE HOURS LATER and she's still talking about all of this, well, more about how she's a martyr, and her mom brings the kid in after school. I turn to the kid and for the first time, got brave and said to the her, ""So what do you do at night when they're having sex?"" And she said, ""I pretend I'm sleeping!""  Both the grandma and mom were speechless, like maybe it dawned on them a little bit about how very bad that sounds.  

I'm not exactly sure how everything went down, but I do know that she's not being taken out of school, she was assessed and the professionals didn't think she was being molested (again, I didn't really think so but still thought this was inappropriate and not just a different form of parenting). They have to clean out one of the bedrooms that's a hoarding pit and provide her with her own bedroom. The girl's father was somehow in the loop and will be more active with her, since he's technically got half-time custody anyway. 

She said she's trying to have a second baby now anyway. And my favorite part, her sycophantic friends, even more poor than her, are doing fund raising on her behalf; for what or why, I do not know. 

For the people saying that they're going to figure out who I am here on Reddit, first of all, these people brag about not using social media, and second of all, they can kiss my ass; I'm leaving soon for nursing school WHERE I'M GOING TO VACCINATE ALL OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN!

I joined all of the Richmond sell it groups and found our girl listed as lost dog found! My brother met them halfway between us and Richmond, and Gracie is home safe. Thank you all for the guidance and kind words!

And to answer the question on why she’s groomed every four weeks: I’m a certified canine esthetician using high end soap free products formulated specifically for the pH of the canine skin. Basically, Pugs shed- a LOT- and it’s crucial to get that dead coat out so her skin can function properly. It’s also recommended by just about every vet ever that nail trims should be performed every 2-4 weeks. If it compromised her skin, we would cut back on the grooming ;)

 My Dad’s girlfriend just skipped town with his dog and is headed back to her home state 600 miles away. We have a police report filed, we have her home address, 5 years of vet records pulled as well as all messages lining up my Dad getting this dog. She isn’t microchipped, I’m going to dig through her adoption paperwork today to see what else we’ve got claiming ownership. I’m also an animal groomer and have five years of her grooming photos saved, further proving ownership. What do we do next? What can we do?

492,Walmart refused to let me leave with groceries I paid for,"Yesterday afternoon I 34 f took my four year old son and two year old daughter grocery shopping at Walmart in Irvine, California. I was waiting on my next paycheck, so I bought $175 worth of groceries with $300 in the bank. The cashier kept asking me to swipe my card saying the transaction did not go through. I checked my bank balance with my Wells Fargo app and found that Walmart had already charged me the $175 for groceries. I asked for a manager to come and fix the situation. Manager assured me the charge would drop off. He asked for my bank card to call my bank. He said he wanted to look at the customer service phone number, so I told him the phone number. I also called my bank. They opened a claim and said they would email me the claim number, but I checked my inbox, and I did not receive an email from them. I asked the manager to try to contact his supervisor to see if the situation could be fixed so I could leave with my groceries as Walmart had already charged me for them and with the transaction pending, I did not have enough funds available to buy more groceries. Manager refused to contact his supervisor. He said, “he’s not here.” I ended up having to leave a full cart of groceries with this manager in tears and drive to Wells Fargo to explain the situation. They told me there was nothing they could do as long as the charge was pending. They said to call them as soon as the charge went through. I called Walmart customer service and explained the situation and emailed their corporate office. This morning, the charge went through. I called Wells Fargo and let them know, and they emailed me a claim number. I also emailed Walmart customer service again. As a single working mom of two young children, $175 is a lot of money to me. That was the grocery budget I had been able to set aside for the entire month for me and the kids. What can I do to make sure I get my grocery money back?"

497,"UPDATE - Condo board is telling me as of June 5th the parking spot i own, will be converted into a handicapped spot, but there are no other parking spots available. Is this legal?","My original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gt4ikx/condo_board_is_telling_me_as_of_june_5th_the/)

Thank you for all the advice, we ended up talking to a lawyer on Tuesday, and we paid him a small amount to write a nicely worded letter indicating that our Condo board had no right to do what they are doing.

The condo board has more or less agreed that they are in the wrong (yeah fuck them), and will be pursing other alternatives to create handicapped parking for this new owner.

Today the owner who wants the spot came to my door, telling me that i need to move my car because as of today it ""belonged"" to her. I explained to her what the condo board told me and she got very upset.

For now i am not going to move my car because i think she could be more of an issue then my condo board.

To answer a few questions:

* I did offer the condo board an option to buy my spot for a stupidly high price of $200,000 and a guaranteed spot when they increase the parking space. They are not interested.
* I do infact own this parking spot it is owned by me and deeded to me.
* There is no street parking/stopping in front of our building.
* Handicapped spots are actually owned/managed by the building.
* The issue came to heads when the people who bought the condo, had a verbal promise that there was available handicapped parking. However not long after making that promise another tenant needed a handicapped parking spot due to him being stuck in a wheelchair. So the spot ended up going to him.
* The actual owner who is complaining about this actually owns a non handicapped spot, however they refuse to trade it because they have two vehicles. Their other vehicle is one of those specialized minivans for wheelchairs.
* Finally the owner who has been making all of this fuss has been trying to take the condo board to court over this.

498,"My roommate tested positive for Coronavirus, then coughed in my face intentionally","My roommate informed me today that she tested positive for Coronavirus.  I decided we need to quarantine.

We argued, and at the end she walked up and coughed in my face intentionally and said, there now we all have it, and let her boyfriend in.

I live in Salem, Oregon.  I feel like the intentional exposure to Coronavirus by my roommate is assault.  

Do I have legal grounds to press charges or go through civil court, for assault or otherwise, for my roommate coughing in my face while positive for Coronavirus?

Edit: So the advice I'm seeing is file a police report, but don't pursue any civil case (waste of time). I did call the police after this, and I verbally told them about the altercation- argument and her walking up to cough in my face and say 'there now we all have it(covid).'
